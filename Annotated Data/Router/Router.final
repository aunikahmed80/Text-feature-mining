[t] Very good Admin Setup & management features
##This is our second Dlink DIR 655 used for a different location
speed[@]##Both have excellent coverage & speed
##Particularly like the ease in setting up a Guest Access with different password, compatibility (i
##e
##g & n coverage while keeping primary just n as well as broadcast the guest SSID while not broadcasting the primary NW)
[t] Overall a very good product
##I bought it for 2 specific reasons
[t] Wonderful in theory
##Have had a D-Link 615 for several years, and have been nothing but pleased with the unit
##Sticking with brands that have done great things for me, I purchased the D-Link 655 to increase the wireless bandwidth throughout the house
##It was super simple to set up, and it was wonderful while it worked
internet[@]##It would drop connections to the internet frequently, requiring a reboot every couple of hours
##I tried upgrading the firmware, playing with the frequencies, the speeds, disabling the 5GHz options, and it continued
##Finally had to return the product
##Fortunately, Amazon is great on their return policies
[t] Seems to be a solid router...
##I bought this router to replace an old Linksys and to go hand-in-hand with a new Motorola SB6120 modem
##Having received the router first I elected to hold off setting it up until I got the new modem
##After receiving the SB6120 and setting it up I set up the router following the instructions they gave
##The set up was pretty simple, basically a matter of hooking everything up and rebooting your system at which time you're taken to the D-Link website to finalize how your setup will be
security[@][u]##This part confused me as I couldn't find how to set your  parameters
##However, a phone call to the D-Link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem
##As of this review I am using the router and it is working very nicely
##Moreover, I found it to be more user friendly than the old Linksys I had
##As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad
[t] Less than a year and starting to give out
##It was great while it lasted but now it is starting to randomly turn off
##I have to plug it back in multiple times to get it to boot up again
##I don't think I will be buying any more products from the DLink brand; they just don't last very long
[t] Very Unreliable
##This router was easy to setup and it was cheap and those are the only two redeeming qualities
##The signal is unreliable
##When we have multiple devices on it becomes very slow and sometimes doesn't work at all
##I have had to reset it several times
[t] Love It
speed[@]##This router was easy to set up and works great, speed is good with multiple users
##I am really satisfied with this purchase
[t] Worthless router - will not stay connected to Internet!
##I purchased this router to for my desktop, 3 laptops and then each of my boys have an Xbox
##My old router was a Linksys that I had for years, and it was starting to slow down or drop connections when we had too much going on at once
##After much research, I got a great deal (I thought) on this router and purchased it
##Set up was pretty painless, although I did have to call technical support to talk me through because there were very little instructions and I couldn't get it to work at first
##But, it worked pretty good for around 2 months, and then it started dropping connections CONSTANTLY! You would be on, then off for 10 minutes, then back on
##it is ridiculous! This led to hours with the technical support (agree with everyone else - they are useless) and changing settings, saving settings, calling back when it still doesn't fix the issue, more hours with technical support, repeat, repeat
##So, they finally sent me another one - said it was defective
##Guess what - SAME THING! Oh, and I updated all firmware as well
##So, now we are repeating hours with technical support
##Finally, I got escalated and the guy said the NEXT time I wouldn't have to troubleshoot and could get right to customer service
##So, the next time came and they tech made me troubleshoot
##Finally got a direct number for customer service and now they are closed
##So, tomorrow will see what they can do but I think at this point I have lost my $100 and I just need to switch to Linksys or something else
##DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! It is completely defective and you will spend hours on it!! It simply does not work
[t] Slow wireless
##I just bought a new DIR-655 and the wireless is basically worthless
##I have toggled every setting I could find
internet[@]##The wireless is slow whether it is from device to the internet through a cable modem or device to device just through wireless
##I get 12 Mb if connected to the ethernet and 1
##5 MB (barely more than 10% of the same speed) with wireless
##The previous DIR-615 is starting to go out, crashing every day, but after a reboot, the DIR-615 is 12 MB with wireless
##Either I got a bad device or this is a bad design
[t] Router decent - wireless horrible
##I bought this router because of the large house advertisement
##It was easy to set up and get running
##The wizards walked you through all the major issues
##The problem comes with wireless
##I am able to surf the web or do normal day to day wireless activities pretty much anywhere in the house
##And my small personal laptop (Asus) seems to work great on the network
##My son's gaming laptop (Asus) and my work computer (HP) just will not stay connected to the network
##These are laptops that virtually live on a wireless network
##The work computer is primarily wireless at work all day and practically flawless
##When connected to this router they just constantly drop their signals
##Even the Xbox 360 seems to have issues staying connected to the wireless network
##Although that is more intermittent
##This is my first DLink versus Netgear and I went with it because of the gigabit ports
##I think it is going back though and getting a Netgear
##** Update 10/10/2011 ** Router is being replaced in less than six months
##Wireless runs for a random amount of time (4-6 hours) and then just quits broadcasting
##I have to hard power cycle the router to get the wireless to come back up
##I would not recommend this router **
[t] Good for Casual Users
##This is not a bad router for the money
##For me it rates average in most areas
##Its setup really isn't that hard as routers go
##You do have to be a little bit "Technologically capable" if you have to go into the router options yourself but I have seen much worse
##Dual band is always good
##This router doesn't seem to take advantage of it like it should but a causal user probably won't notice
##It is reliable and has not given me any trouble since I got it
##It keeps chugging along
##It does run hot
##The temp of this router is probably the highest I've been exposed to
##So be careful when handling it after it has been on for awhile
##It can handle multiple wireless devices well enough
##I have 2 Wii systems connected, a roku box (Roku 2100X XDS Streaming Player 1080p) and two laptops connected through the wireless
##I also have a desktop and two switches connected to the wired portion
##(XBox 360, Printer, and LCD TV connected to the switches
##) It handles it all
##For the money and casual user you can't go wrong
##Has something to offer as a low end router to power users also
[t] It is Ok, but not Great !
##This router product and technical description was far far high than what it is actually
##I have bought this from Amazon and using for a week, I did not notice much significant upgrade or imporvement of my old Blink router of $30
internet[@][u]##I still do not see much difference of N 300+ advantage of online Streaming HD video, music and surfing over 
##In none of these above areas, I could see any noticable change
price[@][u]##Most strkingly the connection I have is 20Mbps which I get directly only from modem or from this router only thru ethernet cable, while I go wireless, if falls significantly in its best positioned antena in a one 1 ft away to 4-5 Mbps which I feel is not worth of its 
##I even called up the customer support and complained about it, but no help
##Pros1
##Nice looking and light weight, folding antena for higher portability2
##Easy setup and installtion3
security[@]##Good security features
##Cons1
##Not worth of its price2
##Wirless signals very average and not upto its class as claimed in the product description3
##3 Antena does not improve any signals
##Overall it is average in quality and performance
price[@][u]##Should be at  tag around $40-50
##Thanks
[t] Good Gigabit-enabled Wireless Router
speed[@]##This product was used to replace a Linksys Wireless-N router on the premise that wireless speed might be enhanced
##It was enhanced! Wireless transmission improved a measurable 23%, and of course the gigabit connections helped with hardwired appliances
##Manual set up was intuitive
##The USB feature is useable, although connections via the D-Link utility take up to 5 minutes for accessibility to start, and a couple minutes to disconnect
##The one gripe is that the indoor transmission range is no more than 30-ft
##through walls
[t] Very Good and Dependable
##This is one of the best routers I have ever owned
##I use this router in my home both wired and wireless
##I have put as much as 1
##2 TB of data threw it a month (that's not the norm but just to give you an idea of what it can handle) and this thing just keeps on ticking
##I have owned mine for around 2 years and am very happy with it
##Pros
[t] Great value!
##I received my router on time and installed it promptly
##I plugged it into my modem and was up and running within 15 mins
##Coming from an old Linksys router, I felt the menu was easier to navigate
port[@]##I haven't been able to play with the USB port yet
##The range is good, not excellent
##I was hoping for much better range than my old router but I would say it was slightly better
##For the price, I'm not complaining
##A good companion to this router is the Dlink DWA-131 Wireless N Nano USB 2
##0 Adapter
##It did pick up the "n" band much better than the "g" band
##Overall I'm happy with the performance
##I didn't spend over $100 so I can't complain
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##The router was easy to install and has worked flawlessly since it was activated
##It does the job it was purchased for effortlessly
[t] pretty good signal through walls
internet[@]##I bought this unit so that guest in a spare bedroom could access the internet
##Its about 60 ft away, and through several walls
##I was pleased to find that I got a 50% signal
##I tried placing it in a window with a line of sight view of the guest room, but the metal hurricane shutter apparently blocked the signal
##I moved the unit away from the window, behind a drywall, insulated, brick veneer wall, and this goes through a insulated roof and a paneled curtain wall in the guest room, and still gives a 50% signal
##I'm happy with the result
[t] Excellent
##Bought this in 2009
##Now more than a year later 6/5/2011
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##Had an old netgear that suddenly started only sending signal to one device at a time and randomly restarting, so I decided to search for a new router
##Finally settled on this one and it was a great choice
##Super easy to set up, I think I had the new switched in for the old in about 10 minutes including unboxing
##Nice accessibility to the more commonly used features and some decent online tutorials to do some more advanced stuff
##Can't speak to the range because all of my wireless devices are within 3 adjacent rooms, but it at least gets all of them even though it's very poorly positioned (sitting on top of the modem, about a foot off of the floor behind a filing cabinet)
##Almost no negative things to say!
[t] D-Link WiFi
##Relieved my concerns finally after many problems raised from the old router since 2006 such as discontinued system often from that router instead of cable station and when blackout the router always discontinued
##So the new one solved eveything
[t] Very user friendly
speed[@]##I purchased a D-Link Dir 655 Wireless Router as a replacement for an old Wireless G Router primarily to improve my wired connection speed between three desktops
installation[@]##Using the instructions on the included installation CD, the DIR 655 was exceptionally easy and quick to install
internet[@],installation[@]##Wired connections were in-place and operating in less than five minutes after making my installation internet connection, and the wireless setup portion took very little additional time
installation[@][u]##The device has worked flawlessly, as I expected, since 
[t] Okay but not great
##We've had this for about 2 years and it initially worked alright
##We started having a lot of disconnects and a firmware update did help a lot
internet[@]##Our house is pretty large and the room where our cable internet comes in is in one corner but the coverage is pretty good
##The unit does get really hot and we've had more issues with the wired ports than the wireless
##It also seems to be pretty picky with how it exchanges data with various cable modem models
##It does get really hot and we have had to restart it many, many times to let it cool down
##For those looking to get more customized with the settings on the router, I thought the interface was pretty good and easy to follow
##It has far more options than I could ever use
##They advertise a network storage capability with the latest firmware update, but my IT guru brother and I could never get it working which is too bad
[t] Fast, Great Signal Strength, DOES NOT GET HOT!
##I got this D-Link DIR-655 wireless router because my portable in my house kept loosing the signal to my Motorola Wireless Cable Modem SBG900
internet[@]##Interestingly, my portable computer seems to access the internet much faster through this wireless router while continuing to use the Motorala wireless cable modem as a modem only
##The D-Link router, does not get the least bit hot, no matter how much left on and used! I can barely perceive any warmth to the touch at all
##I can only guess that the user who complained that it got hot, either didn't remove the protective plastic factory film that covers the vents, or works for the competition
installation[@]##The installation program works well
##However, I had to call a very helpful customer support because my computer was having trouble recognizing my modem through the router at first
##Strangely enough, all I really needed to do was leave the computer connected for awhile after the installation, then later everything ran fine
internet[@],speed[@]##My laptop no longer looses the internet signal which measures much stronger, and the internet response speed is faster than ever
##I am very happy with this router
[t] Returned
##Returning for a couple reasons
##First the router needed to be reset every morning for the three days I used it because the wireless quit broadcasting the network
##Secondly one of my kids older laptops was incompatible which I could have lived with had it not been for the first problem
##Sticking with Linksys
[t] The best wireless router for the money!
speed[@]##I was shy about getting a wireless router mostly due to lack of speed (among the cheaper ones) and poor safety of data
##But with this router thanks to WPA2 and fast throughput I get all that plus reliability and ease of setup
##I plugged it in, put in the CD-ROM and followed instructions
##Then when I wanted to set it up, I logged into it and created my own settings
##That all took no more then 20 minutes
##[Note
[t] It's a good wireless router
##It's good ,but after I bought it two days later ,I saw it somewhere $15 less than Amazon
price[@]##I do not know why amazon can not offer that price ????
[t] DIR655 with Hardware Version B1 Doesn't Provide Loopback Support
##I bought a DIR655 from Amazon in November 2010 to complement an existing DIR655 that I had purchased about three to four years earlier with the intent of experimentally hosting two separate subnets
##I chose to buy another DIR655 because I had been very happy with my first model
##This is a reasonably sophisticated product with lots of forwarding and filter options as well as a reasonably intuitive web based interface
##I quickly learned, however, that my old DIR655 used Hardware Version A1/A2 while my new DIR655 came with Hardware Version B1
##Installing the most updated BIOS available had no effect on the hardware version
##Unfortunately there were some important fundamental differences between these two hardware versions
##I probably should have been tipped off that something like this might happen when I realized how physically different the new DIR655 was when compared with the old one (the bright blue color of the lights and the arrangement of the front panel was quite different)
##Specifically, I had been using my DIR655 router both to host websites on a server behind the router and to provide regular Internet access for all of my other computers that were also on the same LAN behind the router
##The older DIR655 with Hardware Version A1/A2 was fully compatible with "NAT loopback support"
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##I have been using this router for over a month and it works great for the print share feature to allow me to print wirelessly to cannon printer
software[@]##Share software was easy to install for printer connection using Windows 7 Home Premium
##The printer connection is a USB connection to printer from router
##The router was easy to setup and install, but I have only been able to connect at 65 Mbps
##Not sure why this is happening
##Over all I have been pleased with this product
[t] Wow
##This wireless router was a well needed upgrade for our home
speed[@][u]##It was very easy to configure and the upload/download  is incredible
[t] Whoa! Excellent Wi-Fi!!
##Easy to set up and go! Full bars of the wi-fi in all rooms of my 2,000 sq
##ft
##house!!!
[t] D-Link DIR-655 wireless router
##Wasn't as easy as 1-2-3-4 setting up
##After a whole day of trying different set ups it finally worked
internet[@]##It takes between 2 and 5 tries and up to 15 minutes to get on the internet
##A real pain
[t] Best Router
##I have tried several this the best
##The set up was fast and instuuction on use very clear
##WiFi through out 2000 sq
##ft house
[t] It runs like a champ.
##Just plug in the power cable
##Set it and forget it
##I know a thing or two when it these things, and I don't claim to know everything
##I do know that I have to upgrade to the most recent firmware and to use the highest level of wireless encryption, and use a very unique password from the standard default password
##One thing I did learn, I have to change that password often
##Sadly in my case, this excellent device is not being used at its full potential
##At this time its role is as an access point
##This wireless device is attached to a wired router does all the super secret squirrel duties
##The reason why I gave this review that title, "It runs like a champ
##" for a reason
##In conjunction with the wired router, the two devices tag team the their duties and are able to support a multitude of wireless devices
##Those devices included, many laptops, many tablets, and many smartphones
##As long as the family gets connect, they are happy
##This wireless device has been running without a hiccup
##In my book, it is a champion to me
[t] Perfect
##perfect and easy to use
##I connect it and it works instantaneously for all my devices (ipad, wp7, PC, mac
##)
##Great wifi coverage
[t] DIR-655 Simple Setup, good coverage and Reliable
##Decided it was time to upgrade my 802
##11g router, and the DIR-655 was the cost-effective choice to do so
##Using the enclosed setup instructions, it was simple and easy to configure
antennas[@][u]##I did replace the  with higher gain models and coverage seems to be good throughout our 2-story house
##Router is placed in the garage, and we can connect to it from upstairs rooms at 130Mbps
##So far, so good, as we've had it running for 6 months so far
[t] Don't be afraid to exchange it
##Product works very well if it is not defective
##But in my experience D-Link product have higher defect rate than other brands
##I spend two hours in frustration trying to make it work before deciding to exchange and replacement unit worked like a charm in 15 min
##Likely Amazon has great exchange policies
[t] Incompatible with certain networks
##I purchased this router to serve a home network that contains both Macs and PCs
##It replaced an Apple Time Capsule because I wanted QoS functions
##However, when I installed the 655, the Windows 7 machine could no longer connect to my iMac via SMB sharing
##It would just return vague errors
##When I swapped back to the Time Capsule, the errors went away and everything functioned normally
##I spent over two hours with a Level 3 technician from D-Link trying to resolve the problem, and eventually, after trying everything in his arsenal, we give up
##Additionally, I would experience random connectivity problems with my MacBook Air, though the ipad and iphones seem to never experience issues
##At any rate, I returned the unit to Amazon and will be trying something else
[t] The Buggy-est Piece of Crap...
##I've ever purchased in my life
##There are so many things wrong with this router it's a waste of my time to enumerate them
software[@]##The software for this router was probably written by a team of interns (no offense to interns) the DNS proxy engine *alone* crashes between 5 and 20 times per week
##Even after disabling that altogether there are mystery bugs, sometimes a reboot fixes, sometimes I can get to a website for an hour
internet[@]##and yes the source of the problem is the DLINK router, not the internet service provider, not the modem, not faulty internet routers- DLINK
##The DLINK return process for a "buggy" product is non-existent
##You can RMA, but that still leaves you with just a NEW buggy router, and you are on the hook for shipping charges
##Do yourself a favor and stay away from DLINK wireless routers (or at least this one)
##the stats look impressive, but I've sunk more time into debugging and updating firmware than the cost of 5 new routers at a reasonable hourly rate
##-Sean Conner
[t] Why did I actually buy TWO of them?
##I bought two of them
##The first failed last fall, and I liked something about this router so much that I simply bought a 2nd one, even though the first was still under warranty
speed[@][u]##The wireless communication slowed to a crawl and would  up after a power cord removal and replacement kind of re-boot
##Then the wireless communication failed entirely
##So, I went to Fry's and bought the 2nd one
##Now, it is about 6 months later, and the wireless communication is failing again in much the same way
##I ought to have it repaired, just to punish the manufacturer, but what a hassle! I don't really wish to spend hours on the phone with their customer service, just to have them tell me what I already know
##So, I'm now researching for another router, but it certainly won't be a Dlink of any kind
[t] Not happy with the DIR-655
##I purchased the DIR-655 with expectations of screaming WI-FI
##what I got was a unit that had to be restarted twice a day as it would just lose contact with all my devices
##Reset and you'd be good for a few hours and then BAM, lost again
##I tried D-Link tech support and we tried all kind of different settings to no avail
##Strange thing with this unit is we had issues trying to stream audio from any of our notebooks to our Yamaha Network A/V Receiver, heck I always thought it was an issue with our notebooks as I could still "control" the functions of the reciever through the Yamaha Web Interface through my DIR-655, I just couldn't stream my music
##This went on for 7 months
##Finally I threw in the towel and put my old trusty Belkin 54G back up
##No drops, and I can control and STREAM my audio files
##Sorry D-Link, I gave you a shot and it didn't pan out
[t] nice router
##I am not to savy with a computer but the D-link is very easy to install and set up
##I have had no problems with it yet, and I can us my ipod anywhere in the house
[t] D-Link Dir-655 Router
##I was extremely satisfied with the seller of this product, but the product did not live up to its advertised expectations
##I spent over 4 hours trying to make this router work, and I'm not a novice
##I took my first programming course in 1962
##YES 1962!!! After many attempts to make this router work and visiting the manufacturers website to manually install or automatically install it I gave up
##It should take no longer than 10 to 12 minutes to make a router work and reset the password and name your network
##The Seller of this router and Amazon responded quickly and my money was refunded immediately
##Thanks Amazon
##I will definitely use Amazon for future purchases for additional products, but just not a D-Link Router
[t] Good product awesome range
price[@]##Good product awesome range This ia a great buy for the price
##I have had no negetive issues with this product
[t] Great Product
##It works flawlessly! I've owned this router for about two years now
##The router has never given me problems with anything
##There is to many setup options to list
##It has great range and never drops connection
[t] Great Replacement
##This is bar far the easiest set up I have ever experienced in a wireless router
##The connection is much better than the dlink I had from 4 years ago
[t] Decent home router
##I purchased this MIMO router for the following benefits over my previous Linksys router
##It should provide better performance, MIMO (Multiple-Input/Multiple-Output), Gigabit interface and a built-in usb drive
##I gave three stars because it works well when everything is fine
##However, whenever you try to update the setting on the router, it would reboot itself for the update to take effect
##It usually takes 20 seconds to 90 seconds, in various tasks such as updating the policy, schedule to a simple admin user password
[t] Unreliable signal
##This router does not produce a reliable signal, once a day it has to be unplugged and plugged back in which never happened with my old router using the same ISP
##If you try calling tech support (which I don't recommend) you'll likely be on the phone for hours as they ask many unrelated questions before you can even get to telling them the problem
##You of course can't use this with a VPN either b/c of the unreliability it causes lots of problems
##I agree with other reviews that the lights are very bright and annoying
[t] D-LINK DIR-655
##Works great
##I have three Computers going thru it
##Easy to set up and very reliable, and I'm an old beginner
##Thanks Amazon for your great service
[t] Good basic router, but...
##Upgraded from DIR-614 - it just couldn't keep up with my family's increasing streaming/gaming demands
##DIR-655 work fine for us so far - no dropped connections and signal much stronger than the old one
##My problem is with configuration UI - it is straight from last century and very buggy, up to the point been totally useless
##A Bottom line - DIR-655 is a good basic router, but if you need advanced configuration for parental control or other tasks look elsewhere
[t] better than old linksys
##replaced a Linksys router that had to be rebooted every day
##This one keeps on crankin'
##Seems to be a little faster as well
##No complaints
[t] Simply marvelous!
##It doesn't get much better than when a complete wireless novice, such as myself, plugs this device in-line between the cable modem and my desktop PC (just using the "quick setup" instructions) and within 5-10 minutes have a solid connection to my new HP Pavilion laptop
##It's been working flawlessly for 3 months now and no sign of signal loss anywhere in the house
##Highly recommended!
[t] Great home router
##Easy to install
##High quality fast transmission from all areas, with protection from intrusion from unknown devices
##I've had it running 24x7 for a month now with no problems with an extensive home network of devices
[t] works well with Macs!
##Third-party router manufacturers usually give little or no support for Mac users, so I was a bit wary about getting this router to work with video iChat and Leopard screen sharing, despite the generally very positive reviews
##However, these fears turned out to be unfounded, as I was able to start an iChat videoconferencing session out of the box
##Screen sharing worked as well
##Despite the myriad configuration options, this product has thus far been plug and play
##Drawbacks
[t] DLINK DIR 655 Extreme N - Extreme
##Replaced G and this router rocks
##The user interface is easy with someone with some configuration experience in home networks
##Only one major issue and specific to my environment - my previous router successfully issued an DHCP address to an IP LAN phone
##The Extreme and my IP Lan phone don't talk well; meaning, the IP address is being sent but the IP Lan phone can't receive it
##So, someone's firmware is either too high or too low or both
##I would buy again and recommend
##And, the matching USB network dongles work great with the Extreme
[t] Excellent... and here's why I think so..
##I've read lots of reviews for this and other 802
##11n routers (which had a lot to do with my decision to buy the DIR-655)
##So, after using it for a bit
##here are my $0
##02
[t] Great Product
##After careful review of all the major draft n wireless home networking routers I decided on the D-Link 655 as it seemed the best bang for the buck
software[@]##The product had a great quick start guide and software that made the install very easy
software[@]##The only hang-up I had was with the Network Magic software that is included
software[@][u]##It is great  for a beginner but it does use quite a bit of memory and it had a small problem with sharing large folders (with lots of files) that I had to fix at the registry level (after reviewing the FAQ problems section)
software[@]##I have CA for a software firewall and the suggestions from Network Magic worked perfectly
##I have been using the DIR-655 for almost a month without problems or needing a reboot
##It is very fast with my wired and wireless devices
##I highly recommend it
[t] Much Better Than Previous Models
##I have owned three D-Link routers, and this one is definitely the best on yet
##I run an FTP server in Passive mode using Dynamic DNS, and configuring previous routers entailed opening a slew of ports above 1024 for the user's to get back in after authentication (Jumps to ephemeral ports for data transfer which would be blocked by the firewall)
##Not having to have ports just sitting open is great
##This router is much or customizable with in and out ACL's
##Not a business end Cisco router but fine for my purposes
##I have four wireless computers and two had very weak signals before switching to this router
##Now all computers are full bars and transferring at 54G
##(I do not have N Network cards installed in the workstations)
##I have never had any problems with D-Link products, I think that alot of the frustration in the networking field is due to user error
##Great router
[t] Excellent Router
##The DIR 655 by D-Link is a really great router
##I purchased the router to replace a wired router and it has worked flawlessly since being installed
##A side benefit besides being so much faster than my previous router is that my VOIP has improved 100% with its priority routing scheme
##Installation was a snap and it has worked perfectly for the past several months
[t] Excellent Router
##This router is excellent
##I had an old a/b/g Linksys router that was constantly disconnecting the network causing me to have to restart
##I have a normal size apartment and only one n device so didn't know if I should get this but decided it looked worth it
##I am glad I did
software[@]##Setting up is easy and the included Network Magic software is something I never heard of and love
##I have an n (macbook) and a g wireless (windows xp) device that work great and setup with WPA perfectly
##I also have a xbox 360 and PS3 that both setup with WPA perfectly
##I never get connection lag now with the 360 like I used to
##I even have an Open NAT now
##I also have a TiVo HD that had an unknown improvement
##Transfering an HD show to my computer is so fast now
software[@]##I thought it was the software but looks like it was the connection
##If you have multiple devices (including g) and want a constant fast connection, this is the router for you
##Goodbye Linksys
[t] Great performance and features
##I bought this to replace a Belkin Pre-N router
port[@]##The Belkin generally worked well and had excellent range, but suffered from some random lockups requiring a reboot now and then, and its firmware didn't have a some of the site blocking and port forwarding features I wanted
##The D-Link DIR-655 has been rock-solid and the firmware options are vastly more comprehensive than the Belkin Pre-N
##Range is very slightly less than the Belkin, but still very good; the furthest machine is about 150ft away and downstairs, but even through several walls and the floor it still gets an acceptable signal
[t] Very bad software
##D-Link seem to have somehow relisted this device to get round the hundreds of previous reviews, so here's my experience
software[@]##As of 11/2/10 I have to disable SecurePoint on a regular basis, so the last software I was able to load still sends my URLs to a third party I never signed up with
##Surely that's illegal? D-Link threatened consumers for talking about it on their forums
##EDIT
[t] Great router with the features I can use at a price that doesn't break the bank
##Simply put, I own 4 of these routers
##I manage the network at my parents house that has renters and everyone needs wireless connectivity
##I would say the learning curve for the initial set up is a bit steep, but after a little bit of use, it's relatively easy
##The guest wireless access is nice, especially for the renters and to keep them off my parent's LAN
##I recently purchasd another DIR-655 router and it looked different from the previous models, apparently they've updated to a RevB version
##Upgrading the firmware has caused a few headaches, but not enough to drop from 5 stars
##The DIR-655 has been a rock-steady router for a few years now and I believe I made a wise decision, 4 times over
##UPDATE - 08-04-2011I've ordered at least three more of these routers and am still surprised to see this item as a top selling router today
##I have one rev A router that has been chugging along for roughly 3
##The newer revisions look much nicer and I believe they also can use better firmware, not sure since the original rev router is stable and as such I have had no need to update
##The newer routers can have their settings changed and updated much faster
##I have had no issues with any of the router to date, guess I am just lucky
##One quick tip with the wireless setting regarding range, is to set the frequency to 20/40 MHz instead of the default 20 MHz
port[@]##This has helped to extend wireless connectivity where needed, though having dedicated wired ports is my preference (every room in house is hard-wired and there is a d-link 24 port gigabit switch providing connectivity)
installation[@]##The setup process is not difficult and I've never read the manual or used the installation cd
port[@][u]##I don't use the usb  either
##Anyways, that's my take on a terrific router
[t] Excellent device!
##I am very happy with this product, I solved all the issues that I had with my previous router ( TEW-452BRP )
##the main reason that I changed my previous router was because of disconections and that it supposed to have 802
##3g and provide access to my kindle WI-FI, but for some reason it did not worked
##Now I have this great router and I can provide access to my kindle and I do not have any problems
[t] Great wireless router
##Great, affordable router with easy web based setup and great wireless range
##The USB Shareport is a great bonus and it works with a USB hub (powered) for multiple devices
##Each device can only be accessed by one computer at a time but individual devices can be accessed by separate computers at the same time, so one computer can be printing while another is accessing a USB drive, etc
software[@]##Make sure you download the latest version of the Shareport utility software (3
##0), it didn't come on the included CD
software[@]##Better yet try Silex Technology's SX Virtual Link software
[t] A Solid Router
##I bought this to replace my Netgear WGR614 and what a difference! Previously I would get 2-3 VPN drops a day with the Netgear router from a laptop just a few feet away
##Just swapping that router for the DLink DIR-655, I have maintained a continuous connection for over 3 days
##I'm also getting better range on all devices - at least Good reception for all devices throughout my house
##I'm using VOIP now, and there are very few stutters / warble using this router, possibly due to the QoS features
##I'm using the DLink entirely in wireless mode, and it manages 6 wireless devices of various types (laptops, iPods, game adapter, desktops) well with no dropouts
installation[@]##The only slight installation issue I had was not a problem with the router but with one of my legacy devices, a Netgear WGE111 game adapter connected to my Xbox
##The WGE111 doesn't support WPA-2, so I had to set the DLink router to WPA-Personal, WPA Mode
[t] Very good router!
##I love this router and only have one issue with it
speed[@],port[@][u]##The feature of hooking up a printer to the usb  was not very good, but the speed and reliability are awesome
##The setup CD that came with mine was not great, but my father in law just bought one too and the setup CD has improved greatly
[t] Failing after 3 weeks...worse each day.
##I have a new DIR-655, a few weeks old
##Hardware Version A4Firmware Version 1
internet[@]##32NAI sometimes get very slow internet speeds (though that could be my ISP, but I doubt it in this case)
internet[@]##I also lose my connection internet connection frequently even when the computer is wirelessly showing as connected to router
##At first my browsing stalls, the Network Connection in the Systray shows OK, but then it shows a yellow exclamation point
internet[@]##It says that I'm connected to the router but that there is no internet connection
##It will sometimes reconnect itself if I just wait
##Other times if I disconnect the wireless connection and try to reconnect it will see the SSID of the router but then be unable to connect to router a few times
##At times I cannot get to the router control pages from the laptop wirelessly when this is happening
##The laptop is usually just a few feet from the router so the signal strength is usually Excellent
internet[@]##It will show as the comp is connected to the router but mouseover the systray will show "no internet access
##"Power cycling the router will sometimes resolve this but sometimes not
##The DSL modem has been showing a steady Status light indicating that the ISP is up and running
##I have power cycled the modem but I don't think that helps because the Status light is steady
##When the computer cannot route, then all the other devices on the router (VOIP, other computers, wifi Android phones, etc) cannot functions as well
##When I check for the Firmware Version on the router it says it is the latest version
##This problem has happened now with increasing frequency each day
##Update
[t] Easy as 1 2 3
##Follow the instructions and its up and running in no time
##Since it was installed 3 weeks now, it has never gone down or needed to be restarted
##My old one had to be restarted twice a week
[t] Not very pleased
##This router worked ok for first few days then it constantly dropped the wireless connection to the router an had to be reset
##Very frustrating
##What I determined was the DLink has an issue with WPA encryption
##I reset up my old wireless G Dlink with WPA and it too kept loosing connection
##When I back set it to WEP it worked fine
##SO I sent back the DLink N router for a refund
##I would not recommend this router
[t] Very good, but be aware unadvertised "features"...
##Initial set-up was easy, the instructions are clear, and we got functionality quickly
##Subsequent issues required more time and calls to tech support, which was generally knowledgeable and helpful
##The signal is strong and it seems to be working very well, much more consistent and wider range than my Linksys WRT54G
streaming[@]##We got this mainly because we were streaming Netflix through a Roku, and the Linksys kept bogging down
##This one has yet to display the "Loading
##" screen during any movie play
##For that reason alone, I'm very happy with the unit! Quite a step up in speed, apparently
installation[@][u]##I'd caution against opting in for too many of the added  options
[t] Best router out there
##This is a great router for a couple reasons
##I am using it on a network with 15 computers and a couple different switches, and it can stream HD anywhere no problem
##The gigabit switch is a big added bonus, and it routes really fast; definitely a 'prosumer' product
##The settings page is really extensive and has a lot of options that I've longed for on other router's I've had, there's an emulator at [
##]
##The wireless on this is pretty good; it sometimes has trouble reaching to the basement, but the laptop down there sucks
##The lights might be annoying to others, but I have it in a server closet, and if it really bothers you, stick some electrical tape on it
##I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat, and would buy it again no question
[t] Power supply dead after 2 months
##I was initially very pleased with this router, ordered May 2009 - I replaced an old netgear router that was dropping wireless and netflix and it fixed all the problems - for about two months
##The power adapter that comes with it - AG2412-B - died after two months, verified with a multimeter
##I ordered a replacement supply from a 3rd party vendor and now the router is working again, but it cost me $30
[t] Compatibility issues
##I purchased the D-Link DIR-655 to replace a Linksys WRT54G2 that had failed after only 12 months
##The install program on the supplied CD would not run, so I had to use the alternate setup by using the 192
##168
##1
##1 address
##Don't forget to start by updating the firmware, because if you set everything up first then update the firmware, you will need to repeat the setup process since this firmware update restores everything back to the factory settings
##Total setup time was about 20 - 30 minutes
##The router worked OK for all of my devices except for my LG BD370 Blue Ray network player (used to stream Netflix and YouTube)
##I have a hardwire connection from my router to the LG BD370, so you would think it would be simple
internet[@][u]##For some unknown reason, the LG player would not properly connect to the 
##It would require 5 - 20 minutes and typically I would also need to log into the router itself and check the status
##My Linksys router and an older Belkin wireless B router connected fine with the LG player with no issues at all
##After talking to technical support from both LG and D-Link, I was not able to get the issue resolved
##The D-Link technical support was not very helpful
##After several days of trying various settings and trying to get it to work, I decided to return the D-Link router
##Amazon's return process is great and works very well
##I have since purchased the SMC SMCWGBR14-N router
##After a 5 - 10 minute setup process, which included updating the firmware, everything is working as expected including the LG player with no issues at all
[t] Awesome
##There wasn't anything wrong with my old one, butI bought a new one anyway
##Worked 1st time out of the box
streaming[@]##I use Netflix streaming through a wireless adapter on my Tivo box
##Technically, it shouldn't make any difference, but now it worksso much better
##Especially on rewind and fast forward
##I have 2 Tivo boxes and 7 laptops running wireless off thisrouter and it is all good
[t] 5 star performance, 3 star installation
##There is a sequence here to help you understand my experience
##My venerable and aging Belkin Pre-N was giving up the ghost slowly and I decided to replace it
##I first tried one of the current, highly rated Linksys products (the range plus model)
##I must say that the Linksys had poor performance
##It just didn't get all around my home as well as the old Belkin did, and that was making my 16 yr old son especially unhappy with his Xbox360
##However, it installed rapidly and flawlessly
software[@]##The software had it up and running my network, truly, in 10 minutes
##Okay, next story
##This D-Link product is the first thing I ever purchased from them
##The ratings on range were so spectacular I decided to dip my toe in the waters of a company new to me
##Okay, reverse the story above
##Performance is simply amazing
##Blazing
##Stunning
##Best coverage all over my house I can imagine
##Totally delighted
##Set up, however, while was said would take 10 minutes, took around 2 hours
##This included following the included procedures several times and then working my way through troubleshooting various things
##One of the very most annoying things of all is that it asked me to enter (this was normal for it, not part of trouble shooting) all sorts of technical information (that I did have and understand) that the Linksys simply figured out on it's own
##At least in my case, there would have been NO shot at installing it if I had not kept all the very detailed information from when I first set up my DSL account
##At any rate, that didn't work even with all that work and I ended up on a long phone call with the techs at D-Link
##That did get the job done
##It took maybe 20 minutes on the phone (once I got out of the hold que)
##The woman helping me had an accent that made communication less than ideal, but good enough and the work was very competently specified
installation[@][u]##So, I'm happy now and I think D-Link should consider hiring Linksys to write their  program
##Seriously
software[@]##Linksys knows things that D-Link software writers do not understand or care enough to figure out
[t] Worked for 2 days
##I was really excited to finally get an N router, an upgrade from my Linksys wireless G WRT54G2
##First thing I tested was the speed, and I have to say it was abysmal
##On a wired connection with my linksys, speedtest
##net rated my home pc with a connection of up to 25mbps connection and wireless speeds around 15 mbps
speed[@]##Hooked up to the D-Link extreme N, connected speed dropped to 18mbps and wireless down to 8mbps
##AND THIS ONE IS EXTREME
##At first I dealt with this as 18mbps was still REALLY fast
internet[@]##The next day, I turned on my laptop and it connected to the network, but no internet connection
internet[@]##I had read in other reviews that it dropped their internet connection every couple of days so at the first sign of this happening to me, I got an RMA and shipped it back
##SAVE YOUR MONEY
##Go with another brand, I know if I ever bight the bullet for another N router, it will be a linksys
[t] Very happy with this wireless router - updated 7/17/12
##I decided to upgrade my wireless network to the N standard awhile back and decided to try and save some money by buying a cheaper brand
##Big mistake
##It cost me more by doing that
##I bought a Belkin wireless N router at wallyworld because I'm cheap
##It was junk
streaming[@]##It rebooted itself about 5 times a day (not kidding with you), dropped connection about as many times as well (without rebooting), and when streaming Netflix to my XBOX360, Netflix constantly had to readjust because the router kept slowing down and choking it
##Don't buy Belkin
##ok? Save yourself the hassle
##Buy this instead
##It's friggin fast and I've had no issues with it since installing it nearly a week ago
##Set up was simple on the computer
##** READ THIS IF YOU HAVE A GAME CONSOLE **The XBOX was a little more complicated
security[@][u]##Turns out that the XBOX (and I'm guessing some other game consoles as well) doesn't recognize WPA2, which this router defaults to when you select WPA for 
##Took me awhile to figure that out, and only realized it after finding a post on some obscure forum regarding issues with a Sony PSP (of all things) and this router
security[@]##You'll have to change the security to WPA ONLY in the web browser set up utility for the router
##Overall, I'm digggin' this puppy
##~~~~Updated 7/17/12Over three years later and it's still working fine
##I do believe D-Link may be my go-to brand for wireless routers in the future
[t] Never had to reset this router
##I can troubleshoot my way only through the basics of computer and router problems
##I always manage to get my problem solved but sometimes it takes a bit of time
##I'm no expert
##I can't provide the type of in depth review some people need
##For those of you who need a router that works well and provides good signal distance, the DIR-655 is a good choice
##I have never had to reset this router, from the day I configured it 8 months ago it's never lost the signal or had to be reset
##I've owned two top of line Belkin routers and without fail, I'd have to unplug & reset them at least twice a month
##I thought that was normal until I asked our IT guy from work (he installed the DIR-655 at our office, and we've never had to reset that one either)
internet[@]##I use this router for internet access via my laptop only, no gaming
##I can honestly give this product two big thumps up!Cheers!FLY NAVY!
[t] Difficult Set Up!
internet[@]##Ease of set up will rely on what type of modem you have and who provides your internet service
##D Link gives you no warning
##I did the quick set up disc
software[@][u],installation[@]##The installation  system indicated "all systems OK" "successful installation"
internet[@]##The only problem was I couldn't access the internet
##I took phone calls to D Link in India, ATT in India and California to reset my PPPOE information and reset my connection type to "bridged" before success was achieved
##Total time, 3 1/2 frustrating hours
##That being said, the device works great, much better than my girlfriend's netgear G
##Note
[t] Love the router
##I love this router
##It's fast!! No regrets buying it
##I would suggest placing the router in upward/standing position using the included plastic stand, in that way you wouldn't have any problem overheating
##So far it works great! Just follow the instructions & user reviews suggestions proved helpful too with regards to updating the firmware
[t] Less than a month old, wireless randomly stops broadcasting
##This wireless router seems to have known problems, and D-link has been unresponsive as of yet
##See their own forums
[t] Fantastic solution!
##So I must say I am very impressed! Keeps multiple hard-lines working as fast as ever, as well as provides me the wireless capability for my Panasonic flat screen TC-P42G25 WITH PERFECT HD STREAMING! & NO LAG! while being over 40ft away downstairs surrounded by cement walls! Also provides perfect reception for my laptop
##This is the best router I have ever purchased! You will not go wrong with this router
[t] Just my luck
##This router was a big disapointment
##I spent 3 days with tech support and the router finally had to be returned as defective
##Tech support was not too friendly either
##It started up ok on the first day but then it started to drop connections
##The support tech tried various fixes including firmware and other undocumented tweeks
##I suppose that all brands have lemons and judging by the ratio of good to bad reviews I would say that this is one to stay away from
[t] Solid, but drops connection too much
##I bought this router roughly a year ago after my old belkin router died
##Compared to my old router, it was a big upgrade
##At first the router had no problems and worked great
##But after a few months I noticed it started to drop the connection when I would be playing an online game on the PS3
##It would only happen ocassionly, so I did not think about it too much
##However, it started to do it more frequently, and currently it will usually drop out a couple times an hour if I'm playing rockband or another straining online game
##My other friends I play with online have less expensive routers than I do and have better reliabilty
##I'm usually the one that disconnects
##I cannot even watch netflix on my ps3 because it constantly loses connection
##I'm in the process of buying a new router only after using this one for a year
##In a nutshell, it works great for a few months, but does not have a good lifespan
##I would not recommend it if you are a gamer as it seems to not take online gaming very well
##However, I'm sure it works fine for less straining devices such as a laptop
[t] All the features I expected, easy enough to use.
##This router works as advertised
##I'm by far no computer genius and I know just enough about advanced settings in routers to be dangerous, but this thing was a breeze to set up
security[@]##The security was easy to set up
##I have never had to reset the router because it was acting funky
##I was able to have one XBox hooked up wirelessly playing Black Ops multiplayer, another hooked up via hardwire playing Black Ops multiplayer, my laptop connected wirelessly playing Pandora, and my phone connected via wifi, all at the same time (and more times than not my buddy and I were hosting the Black Ops multiplayer matches!)
##I recommend this router
[t] Doesn't work well with Windows 7
##I use Windows 7 Home Edision 64 bit
##After lots of effort, the connection is still on and off
##Besides, the company technical support has little help
[t] Died in 3 days.
##I bought this router based on some excellent reviews that I read online
##However, my experience with this router was all bad
##It did not play nice with my Mac Book Pro
##It was always having a hard time establishing a connection with the router
##It worked okay once I turned off Ipv6 on my Mac Book, but I had to do a ton of troubleshooting to find that solution
##Even then it still had intermittent connection issues
##Then on day 3, the router died completely
##No power, no lights, no data, nothing
##I tried a couple of different outlets to make sure it wasn't a bad socket
##It wasn't
##The router just died
##I would not recommend this router to anyone, and I'll be looking at other options for a replacement
[t] Great for Roku Video Streaming comes with 110 - 240 voltage power supply for worldwide use
##I have purchased this router after researching for a Wireless Router which can support Video Streaming
##I have a Time warner cable broadband connection (10 MB/sec) and use Roku box to stream video to the Tv, Use a Vonage VOIP Phone and have a wired connection to the Desktop
##This Router is great for Video Streaming and has been working well for over 18 months with out any issue
##This router comes with a power supply adaptor rated for 110 V - 240 Volts for worldwide use including india and europe
[t] Used On The Job - Excellent Router
##I just bought a DIR-655 for myself at home, ordered 4
##16
##2011 and it arrived 4
##22
##2011, as advertised on my Amazon `orders' page
##I mainly want to share when I built a new online company in 2009, I used the DIR-655 for home-based employees, about 25 of them
##As IT Director, I had a very unique situation with employees working from home, across the US
##Voice quality over Internet was CRITICAL and I was very concerned
##The DIR-655 has Quality of Service (QOS) for Voice over IP (VoIP) telephones, turned on by default, which we used for employees as well, so they could use our company telephone system
##QOS ensures voice gets priority over regular traffic such as browsing and email
##Otherwise you can or will get the 'er, ah, ett, vich' broken voice junk
##In the online company case, employee computers and the telephones connected directly to the DIR-655 via patch cable
##During the testing where employees were based across the US, I was very, very concerned about voice quality, but the DIR-655 worked very well
##Voice quality was consistently great
##I had not used the DIR-655 before and never used 'public' Internet connections from someone's home for business work
##The DIR-655 was recommended by the telephone system carrier I used for our telco network services and they really liked it
##In the time I was at the online company, the DIR-655 worked VERY well, NO flaws or failures, no bad units
##Can't speak for the 240+ who rated the unit a one star, but I never had any issues with them, and the voice quality was excellent, a critical factor in business
##Perhaps heat is a concern for some or many, but my concern was RELIABILITY, and the DIR-655 has done very well in that section
[t] Great for a few days, then it starts dropping connections
##I purchased this item by just looking at what people said in the reviews and since this product got 4/5 stars, I thought it won't be a bad purchase
##The first few days the router worked well, but after about a week or so the router started acting strange
##I would see that the "internet" led light on the router would stay blue (turns yellow if there's limited/no connection), but for some odd reason I can't visit any website
##I would go on Amazon or even Google and the site won't load
##One way to fix the problem was to disconnect my cable modem and the router and reconnect them after a minute or so
internet[@]##Another way to fix the problem was to let it sit for about 15 minutes and you will get internet working again
##I thought it was my ISP that had the problem, so I switched to my old Linksys (Wireless G) router and I didn't get any disconnects after that
##This router also runs very hot
internet[@]##This is a great router when it works, but when you're internet connection gets lost every few hours, it gets annoying
streaming[@][u]##I wasn't  anything HD over the web either
##I would just get random disconnects here and there
[t] Seems a little short ranged
##I'm not sure this is a valid critique of this specific router, because it's the first and only wireless router I've ever owned
##Perhaps all routers suffer from the same problem, I just don't know
##What I can say however, is that I'm a little disappointed in it's lack of range
##It does say in the instruction manual that intervening walls in a home will reduce the effective range of the router and I have mine in a back bedroom where my desktop computer is, where the cable companies cable enters the house
##That's where the cable modem is so it's the logical place for the router
##However, when I use my laptop in the dining room, approximately 40 feet away, with two intervening walls, I can only get two bars of signal strength
##There is another wireless router at a resort complex five miles away and I can get one bar for that router
##I would hasten to add that I am still able to surf the web, etc
##with only two bars of signal strength, but it just seems to me that the performance should be a little better
##I haven't tried going out on the patio, where there would be four intervening walls, but my hopes are not high!
[t] Practically useless
##This router is one of the worst pieces of networking equipment I've ever owned (and I had a Netgear GS605)
##Anytime a large file transfer was attempted, it would lock up
##After about 15 minutes (if I had the patience) it would continue, but then in 100Mbit mode
##I tested this with 3 different computers, using NFS, SCP and rsync, and every time the router would hang during transfer
##Sometimes it would not wake back up (I left it for 30 minutes once) and I had to power-cycle it
##I returned it to Amazon (kudos on their customer service), got a new one, and it did the SAME THING
##Oh, in addition to the previous troubleshooting I also reset the router to factory defaults, turned off its QOS, and only plugged in two machines (to avoid crosstalk)
##Same problem
##I tried to make it work every way I could think of and no dice
##So I went back to my trusty three-year-old Linksys (with DD-WRT) and had absolutely no problems
##Do yourself a favor
[t] Superfast, but supposedly the WPA encryption is not compatible with XP
##I know just enough networking to screw things up royally when I usually set up these kind of things in my house -- so credit goes to D-Link for creating a product where I connected my laptop (running Vista) pretty seamlessly, about an hour after I opened the router and replaced my old one
##Having set up WPA encryption on the HP, I also have a desktop (on XP Pro) upstairs, using a G-wireless network card
##There were some problems with setting this up, so after a few calls to customer service at D-Link (pretty helpful, especially the higher-level tech support guys), they told me that I had to set it up using WEP encryption instead as XP is not compatible with WPA
##Once I switched this, everything is running superfast and I am happy with the performance
##Only my network is really not that secure! So I need to find out if there's a way to do this, or just upgrade my old machine to a new computer running Vista or newer OS
##Also, I found that after switching to this router and WPA encryption, email attachments were getting blocked and the tech support people had no idea why
##But all in all, the router is fast and the signal strength is great for use in our townhouse
[t] Excellent piece of equipment
price[@]##The price is good, and the bandwidth is excellent
##I would and will buy another for another site
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##This router seems to work fine
##I did have to change the default IP address as it conflicted with an address already used by my computer
##I purchased it to replace a Linksys wireless G router and was hoping for increased range
##Switching my wireless to wireless N at the base and on my laptop made no noticeable difference at my house
[t] Not a Plug and Play Router - Tech Support???
antennas[@]##Purchased router and additional antennas to extend range/signal
##I wish I could tell you that the add-on was worth it or not, but since I never got it completely installed for wireless, I'll never know
##Tech Support read from their script while sitting in a land far far away
##She was terrible, could NOT be understood, nor could she understand me that well
##So, I asked for a Supv
##, and she could not understand me well enough to fulfill my request
##I thanked her for her attempt
##I had read that this was the router to have
##well
##not for me
##I have only been working with computers and communication equipment since 1975 and have never been so frustrated
##Easier to set-up a TDM in 75 that attempt to get this jewel to work
##Packed it and sent it back
##then purchased the dependable Linksys N and it was plug and play
##Laptop is located in the pool house about 80 - 100 feet away and signal is Very Good!!Amazon was great about the RMA, so they got to sell the new Linksys
[t] Did not work for us
##We have 3 Macs and 1 PC
##We got this router so we could all print from one printer
##The router was very slow with all the computers
##And the printer could not communicate with the router
##We are looking for a buyer
[t] Failed after two months
##Failed after three months
##First everything worked fine
software[@]##Automatic setup software didn't
port[@]##After two months the USB port started failing ever 30 seconds- turned that off
##Then the ports would lose conections
##Reinstalled my old unit everything worked fine
[t] Replaces costly broadband
##Replacing the less-expensive DIR-625 802
##11-BGN router, this eliminated the need for PLC range extenders to allow laptops to be used from every room in the house, it remained connected to the Internet for the entire road trip from Washington, DC to Key West, saving the expensive monthly EV-DO charges for mobile broadband
[t] might be the best 802.11n Wireless Router for the money
##I just received it yesterday, 4 days using the free shipping as this item qualifies
##Thanks Amazon
##simply awesome
##I've had the same wireless router for over 8 years now
##SMC7004 Barricade ($300 at the time), RIP (actually it's still alive and well, just retired)
##This D-Link is officially the second wireless router that I've purchased for myself (setup up a few for friends and family)
##So, I've been patiently waiting for the right one to buy, albeit it's probably 5 years late
[t] Really the best Wirless N router for this price..
price[@][u]##D-Link DIR-655 is Really the best wireless N router for this 
##I've bought this device 4 months ago and I'm glad for my choice
##Router was easy to configure
##device came with the latest firmware
##It has great signal! and good range
##I'll recomend this device to anyone!
[t] d-link router 655
##router was very easy to hook up just put in the disk and it will walk you right through
##downloading was no problem where ever i was in the house it was fast
[t] ROUTER DLINK
##IT WORKS PROPERLY, HOWEVER FORGET TO CONFIGURE WITH THE CD, GO DIRECTLY THROUGH MANUAL CONFIG - FASTER AND EASIER
##SECOND IF YOU WANT TO CONNECT IT TO A ROUTER PREVIOUSLY CONNECTED TO THE BROADBAND, YOU NEED TO CLONE THE MAC, THERE IS NOTHING FOR THAN IN THE MANUALRE
[t] Generally good
security[@],speed[@]##it's a pain to set up the security system and the speed is decent but not as fast as it says
[t] Great product!
##We've been using this for a little over a month
##It's been fast and efficient
internet[@]##It handles gaming, video streaming, and regular internet use without any trouble
[t] D-Link router
##This router didn't provide the range I needed and it often dropped the etherenet cable connection
##I think it was defective
[t] Piece of Crap
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigbit Wireless Router does not provide any better performance than an entry level Linksys; do not waste your money on this product
[t] D-link router 655 version 2
##I give 3 star for the 2nd version D-link router 655
##Actually it is the second version with new firmware packed in new blue box while the first one is in orange box
##It receives 3 star because of the change of input voltage
##Most of new electronic devices support input range from 100 to 240v, however the new D-link router input is only 110 to 120v while the 1st version is full compatible with 100 to 240v
[t] works well enough
##this is the first wireless n product I've owned, so I really have no basis to compare against except my older linksys 10/100 router with a linksys wireless G access point
speed[@],streaming[@]##One big noticeable difference is the wifi speed of the wireless n to my television which has a wifi n adapter, it is fast enough to view HD streaming easily
##However, with this particular product, the wifi tends to drop probably 2-3 times a week, which means I must log and reboot the device or manually unplug the power to restart it
##One feature I liked on the linksys access point was that wifi devices could be placed on a MAC access list while those on the LAN could be connected freely, the D-Link doesn't seem to segregate the LAN and wifi devices, if you want a MAC access control feature enabled, you must list all wifi devices as well as your regular LAN devices
[t] router review for Dir655
price[@][u]##This is an excellent router for the 
internet[@]##Right out of the box I had in installed and was on the internet in no time
##My only problem was with the wireless side of the router
##The lan cable side got me on the net in no time
##For some reason the wireless side was causing me problems
##The tech support for this router is terrible
##First of all you get a foreigner who is very hard to understand and secondly they are no help at all
internet[@]##My internet provider was more help then the D-link Techs
##After a couple of hours I got it figured out and had the wireless working
##Once connected everything was great
##Speed was fantastic
##I would recommend this router
##Just don't depend on getting any good tech service from the company
[t] Bad Router, Unreliable wireless.
##First let me start off with saying I am a computer repair technician that does online computer repair
internet[@],streaming[@][u]##I am not a casual internet user and when im not remoting into computers im  or gaming
##I suspect there must be a lot of casual users reviewing this router because I can't imagine why its so high rated
##Perhaps I got a defective model?Anyway this is a chart of a ping being done every 2
##5 seconds
[t] Not impressed
##Range is not as strong as i expected, it did not work well in my home as the range did not improve much over the old wireless-G router i had
[t] A flawed long term use hardware problem?
##On my first Netgear product
##Wireless Linksys failed completely after 19 months
##D-Link d655n also pooped out the wireless after 17 months
##So wireless failed before 2 years on both
##Now on Netgear
##flawlessly so far
##(lol LIEFTIME WARWRANTY they Say)So my question is
[t] Wireless Router
##My neighbor showed me how to order, then installed for me
##I have no idea what he did, but he saved me a bunch of money by ordering online rather than geeks
##I am in my late 60's and am not savy to computer hookups, etc
[t] ID-Link is a D-Ddont
##I bought this router to replace a Belkin Basic unit that was too slow and had limited range
##Out of the box, it looked great, but that's where my enthusiasm ended
##This is one of the most difficult and tedious units to configure
##I had nothing but problems trying to set this unit up
##After two days of trying, I finally was able to connect only one laptop to it but the connection was very intermittent and frustratingly slow
##My attempts to connect to other devices failed
##Needless to say I was very disappointed with it and quickly re-packaged it and sent it back
##Dont waste your time on this
[t] Well I thought it was a good idea
##I guess you can't give a product zero stars or i would of - I should of paid attention to the negative reviews about connectivity
security[@][u]##I'm a IT Professional with a CCNE and STILL couldn't get the darn thing to connect to Cox Communications - I spent the better part of a weekend playing around - my old NetGear works fine - just wanted some new  features - do you self a favor and pass on this model
[t] EXCELENTE
##Llego rapido, fue muy facil instalar, tiene muy buena se&ntilde;al en mi casa de dos pisos y es toda de concreto
[t] The one to buy!
##This product worked very well for our office
##We needed something for visitors to use while they are here between meetings and this was just what "the doctor ordered"!
[t] Don't purchase D-Link DIR-655
##I purchased this wireless router because my previous experience with D-Link
##They have good reputation on the quality of product, especially for their network devices
##After purchased the device and connect with laptops at home, I found it kept rebooting itself every 30 min - 1hrs
##Initially, I thought it has something to do with the heat which I read from other forums
##I moved the device to a cooler place and remember, we purchased the device in winter and placed device near window so there is no way the heat will be the issue
##The reboot problem happened several times throughout the day and I finally decided to call customer service number
##Surprisingly, the technician picked up phone very quick but those people from India do not seem to have idea what they are talking about
##I sometimes wonder they are reading instructions from their screen without any technical background
##I decided to trace the problem myself before returning the device to Amazon
##I first isolated to only 1-2 devices connected to my D-Link DIR-655 in order to narrow down whether any of our PCs at home send out any abnormal packets then the router would reboot
##I finally found the source of one of our laptop which is used by our kid
##Every time he played games he downloaded from Facebook, the router would reboot
##If the reboot issue is not critical enough, I also have problem to use the router the share printer among all PCs at home
software[@]##Even after install software from the CD, no other computers can share our printer except the one originally connected to the printer
##In addition to the connectivity and printer sharing issue, I want to warn whoever decided to purchase the device because it has parental control feature
##IT DOES NOT WORK
##When I called to complained the parental control feature, I was told the product is EOL, end of life and I need to spend another $65 for the product
##Finally, I want to give credit to Amazon where I purchased the product
price[@]##They credit full amount of price I spent to me within one week after I returned the product and I didn't need to pay the shipping fee since the device DOES NOT work
[t] I do not reccomend!
##Well, first of all I had problems with setting up the router
internet[@][u]##I had wireless  and everything working correctly, but the setup did not recognize this and would not let me move on to continue in the setup
##After the 4th try, I got it to move on
internet[@]##Once I got it hooked up, it worked pretty good, with the wireless internet and everything else
##Then I left for a hour and a half, and then the router completely DIED
##It was on for no more than 3 hours and now you can not get anything to come up from the router, lights or anything
##In those 3 hours there was only one laptop using the device and yet it still managed to die
##I do not recommend this, and it is going to be shipped right back
[t] No such luck........
##Generated the same error code while attempting set up on both an XP and a fresh new vista machine
##Tech support really couldn't help me out either
##So in the end it went back to amazon
[t] d link dir 655
##Very reliable and an upgrade over the old technology but in order to get the full benefit you must buy another card to connect to laptop
##I got 24-54mbps consistently and rarely goes down
[t] whatever
##Router not very stable, kept going on and offline (rebooting?)
##I disabled 40MHZ mode and still had roblems
##Got thru to D-Link tech support who recommended changing some settings, including changing from channel 1 to ch 11
##It seems to have cleared up all of my problems but I have no idea why
##Hope this helps somebody
##PS
[t] trouble going to opposite side of house
##I purchased this wireless router so I can use my laptop downstairs and the opposite side of the house from the router
##It doesn't have any stronger of a signal than the cheap wireless router I was using
##So for going the distance it isn't very good
##Seems it goes up to 30 or so feet then looses signal
[t] Great Router
##I replaced an aging Linksys wireless router mainly to take advantage of the 'n' capabilities
##The DIR-655 has lots of features for those who want to tweak a little
##One is the ability to set the wireless transmitting power (L, M, H)
##This is great for those who don't want to share their wireless with nearby neighbors or for those who just want less wireless power flowing through their bodies
[t] Works great
internet[@]##I bought this router because my Linksys router kept disconnecting me from the internet
port[@]##This router works great except there is a firmware problems with the USB port on the back of the router
##You can not hook a printer up to the router and share it over the network
##There is a glitch in the firmware for that
##Maybe D-link will fix this problem one of these days
##Besides that, the router works great
[t] Not so great with the Xbox 360
##The firmware had to be upgraded out of the box of course
##I like some of the features, although the config can get fairly complicated
##The Xbox 360 we have lags all over the place with this router installed
##I have tried turning on/off QOS with no impact
##Placing a Linksys instead makes the problem go away
##Because of the kids, if I can't figure out the lagging/streaming issue, the Dlink will probably sit in a closet somewhere
[t] Solid!
##This is a great wireless router and gigabit switch
speed[@][u]##I have not  tested it yet but for the price, I am sure it will perform
##I receive auto emails of the firewall logs, per my schedule
##I wish it was DD-WRT supported
[t] Awesome router!
##I've been using this router for well over 6 months now and it has been fantastic
##I play World of Warcraft so it is key to have a reliable router on raid nights
##;)2 desktop computers and an Xbox 360 are wired
##The rest of the connections throughout the house are wireless including
[t] Great Router
##The set up was easy and the range is excellent
##I particularly like the option to connect a printer and share it wirelessly
[t] Inconsistant...horrible.
##This router would not maintain a consistent connection
##It worked fine for a few days
##Then, the speeds would go anywhere from 0mbps to 17mbps to
##5mbps download, etc
##I called D-Link customer service and ran through all of the typical "fixes" that I had already conducted before calling them - resetting it, hard-resetting it, upgrading firmware, so on
##I just put this thing in the box and shipped it back
##It's supposed to be an incredible router and is one of the Xbox Live recommended ones so maybe I just got a lemon
[t] By far the worst wireless router I have ever owned.
software[@],installation[@]##I performed the installation according to the instructions and loaded the setup software on my laptop and hardwired the router to my laptop to finish the setup
security[@]##The router never connected with any of my wireless devices though I used the same security setup as the router I was replacing
##I spent 3 hours trying to connect wirelessly to the router but could only communicate by a hardwired connection and never managed to get online
security[@]##I even tried to run with no security at all and was never able to connect wirelessly
##I have been installing wireless networks since the 'a' protocol came out and have never been more disappointed with a router
[t] D-LINK 655
##SO FAR SO GOOD
##IT DID WHAT IT IS ADVERTISED FOR AND I AM ON WILDBLUE EXEDE AND I DO NOT HAVE TO REBOOT MY MODEM EVERY DAY LIKE I HAD TO WITH THE D-LINK 601 TO MAINTAIN MY DOWNLOAD AND UPLOAD SPEED
##THAT IS NOT SAYING THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO DO IT, ALL I AM SAYING IT LASTS NOW THREE TO FOUR DAYS AS OPPOSED TO EVERYDAY OR MORE
##AS FAR AS SPEED FOR THE DEVICE,WELL IT IS PRETTY GOOD AND FAR MORE RANGE THAN I HAD ON THE 601
##SO TO WRAP IT UP,RIGHT NOW AS I WRITE THIS, IT IS WORKING VERY WELL FOR US
[t] Unacceptable Range
##This is a one room router! Signal strength is so week it is almost useless
##I got this for my garage which is 200 feet from my house
##When I stand in front of my garage I get a stronger signal from the router in my house
internet[@]##What's worse, even my hard wired desktop computer now has a slower internet connection than my 12 year old Linksys
##I get a better range with my bluetooth headset than I get with this thing
##I am very unhappy with this router and strongly advise you to purchase something else
##This thing is a joke and it's not very funny
[t] Not Happy
speed[@]##I bought this and set it up, it doesn't provide a faster speed or farther range then my previous router it is the exact same, It was a waste of 72 dollars because I cant return it because it's opened I saw and heard such good reviews about it, I'm severely disappointed
##If any one has any idea why this doesn't work as it should please help me out
internet[@]##I currently have AT&T; U-Verse Max internet and I was using the wireless router provided to me from AT&T
##;Thanks
[t] do not buy
##We have tried repeatedly to setup this router as per instructions, but it just does not work
##Possibly defective
##Will try to return
[t] an easy-to-install router
##I found the router quite easy to install, simpler than D-Link's earlier models
##Strong signal
##It was a refurbished model
##I'm quite satisfied
##Only problem I have is when the 16-year-old in my house monopolizes the bandwidth, but that would be true of any wireless!
[t] Great product - Device
##Works very good overall
installation[@]##Easy installation
##Very good range of signalIt has a very great connectivity that make it works with many devices at the same time without loosing the strength
[t] Horrible Tech Support / Bad Router
##All I have to say is if you have time to deal with long hours on the phone and difficult people to understand, then D-Link Routers are for you
internet[@]##Further, If you enjoy constant internet wireless drops, and many times no internet at all, than D-Link is for you
##I would not recommend this product to anyone, it does not accomplish what it claims, and this is the third one from tech support that I have had since the original order
##Very Dissapointed with the companies policies on refunds, and tech support on their service
##Will not buy any more D-Link in the future
##Very Dissapointed!!!!
[t] worst router I ever had !!!
##Tis was the worst router I ever had
speed[@]##My current LAN speed is 30MBPS, you know how much speed this router provides when I connect it to my modem
##hardly 4 MBPS
##D-Link sucks bigtime !!!
[t] Very Bad
##i was looking for a Gigabit router to replace my 6 year old linksys
##I was going by the reviews and didn't think it would be that bad, it is worse
speed[@]##It was easy to setup but when I connected I kept losing speed
##On downloads I would start out great but they never finished as the connection slowly worksed itself down until it dropped
##I called service and got hung up on bt 2 reps, the 3rd rep kept going over the same items and when i told him I was hooked up with a wire he insisted the issue was with the wireless settings
##I got a level 2 tech and they went over the same things the first tech did, and this time started to demand what my public IP was, when I told him my linksys works be it slow and this thing goes up and down he kept saying it could be an issue with my connection
##I'm going to return this and buy a netgear or linksys
##Anything but a D-Link
[t] So far so good.
##I'm not a review writer, but as one other reviewer mentioned, there were some pretty negative reviews on this product particularly related to setting it up
##I am only a moderately computer saavy person and the set up on this could not have been easier
streaming[@]##I bought this router to improve my performance for streaming netflix through Roku and managed to set up the router, connect it to Roku, and then watch several episodes (with no stuttering!) all in an evening's work
##So, while I can't comment yet in detail about performance, set up was a snap
[t] Fast but not fully Mac compatible
##This router is fast
##I use it mostly for ethernet
##I get about 80mb of my 100mb service though it
##My old Netgear only gave me about 10mb
##I get about 40mb in wireless mode
##My old Netgear (g) only gave me 1mb
##I keep wireless turned off most of the time because new research is showing that wireless can damage your DNA
##I'd keep it at a good distance
##I had difficulty in accessing the set-up menus on my Mac using FireFox, IE, and Safari
##Lot's of can't find page or scrambled pages in IE
##When I switched to Google Chrome the problem went away, and I like Chrome so it is not really a big problem
##I also did fine from a Windows PC running FireFox and IE
##So be careful if you have a Mac and are not prepared to use Chrome
##It is not fully Mac compatible in that respect
##It works fine for accessing the Web though, It is just setup that is a problem
[t] good product easy setup
##purchased as part of upgrade with new modem
security[@]##setup was a snap security setting were relatively easy to do
##wireless range is much better than product I replaced, which was still working but was 10 years old
price[@]##good choice great price
[t] Worked great, easy setup
##Setup was a breeze and worked great
speed[@]##Not quite seeing the speed improvement I expected with 'N', but that may be more a limitation of my upstream pipe speed
##Would recommend this to anyone interested in an all-in-one wireless router
[t] Peforms Great!
internet[@]##I purchased the DIR-655 to replace a problem (Belkin) that continued to disconnect from the internet, which made it real frustrating to play online games or chat via the internet
##Real happy with the D-Link
##I have had 3 computers running off the router playing WOW with no problems at all
##No disconnect issues and no lag, so far it has performed great
##Real easy to set up
price[@][u],streaming[@][u]##Performs okay with  media but you might want to consider the DIR-855 if the  is not an issue
[t] Whiz, Bang
##I purchased this router to connect my computer to my Bluray DVD player so that I could get netflix
##The install was effortless, the instructions were complete and easy
##Best of all it worked perfectly from the moment of turn on
##I would recommend this unit to anyone, I wish all computer electronics were as simple
##I was up and running in just a few minutes, however the Bluray install took 3 hours
security[@]##The security set up was a piece of cake
[t] Two thumbs up, best router i've ever owned!!! ##Dlink Xtreme N+ Gigabit Router DIR655 is the best router I've ever owned
##It was a breeze setting up this bad boy, just ran the wizard and it all did the setup
##Pros
[t] Good router overall
##Overall, this is a great router
##I have had some issues with the firmware, just like every other router I have owned (from any manufacturer)
##Yet, this unit is exceptionally stable and reliable
##Here are some comments that may not be in the mfg specPro's+ Speed is great, clocked 90mb from one wireless laptop to router to another wireless laptop (wireless N)+ IP Reservation system - allows you to assign an IP to a device/client, while allowing them to still utilize DHCP+ Dynamic DNS support through d-link or dydns+ Webapp makes all of the set-up functions and administration a breeze+ allows you to save a profile of all of your settings in case the router needs to be replaced or wipedCon's- Signal strength/range
##okay
##I purchased the optional antenna system and it seems to help a little
##- Tech support is slow and farmed out overseas- Firmware has several minor bugs, which are annoying until you learn to live with them
##- No central place on the webapp that shows all the connected clients (sometimes they dont come up at all)
[t] Unreliable firmware ruins an otherwise good unit
##After a year of frustration with this unit I'm finally tossing it and getting an ASUS RT-N16 instead, which supports open source firmware and gets rave reviews for its stability (when loaded with the Tomato firmware)
speed[@]##The DIR-655's hardware is great, strong wireless coverage throughout my 1750 sq ft flat and great speed
##Setup is not for newbies, you'll only want to buy this if you're comfortable dealing with a hundred different settings for your network (which is of course how people want to spend their time
[t] Good router
##This router is very stable
##I haven't reboot it in 2 months while my old Linksys needed daily reboot
[t] Works like a champ
##Replaced a "hanging" LinkSys BEFW11S4 that need daily resets
##The D-Link hasn't needed a reset and offers better N thru-put and WiFi range
##Works with Mac's, Apple TV, PS3, and TiVo USB WiFi
[t] prioritizes VIoP calls just like it says
##Spent alot of time looking for a router that really works to improve my experience with Vonage VoIP phone work
##Didn't know where to get reliable information until I read the customer feedback on this product here on Amazon
##I took the plunge based on a those few positive reviews that people had with this router and the improvement they saw on their VoIP phones
##Glad I did
##That is why I am taking the time to write this--This router has proven to have a very long range, be effective , well priced, secure and simple to use
[t] Doesn't work. Customer support no help.
##This router has caused me much grief
##It is supposed to interoperate with older G and B wireless adapters, but it doesn't
##I have 3 machines in my house, all wireless
##One desktop and two laptops
##Only the newer Dell laptop works with this router
##In fact "works" is really stretching it
##After over an hour on the phone with tech support, the problem he claimed would be fixed was not
##The router drops connections regularly on the new Dell and does not connect at all with the other 2 machines
##In a final attempt to get the thing to work, I updated the firmware to version 1
##20 from the dlink website, only to find out that it made the situation worse AND when I went back to the website to look again, the 1
##20 firmware had been pulled and was no longer available
##Dlink knows they have a problem interoperating with older wireless adapters, and are trying to fix the situation
##So, bottom line is
[t] Wireless Router
##This router is highly commendable
##It's fast
##The long wait of getting connected is now history
##Am very pleased with this purchase
[t] Terrible Support
##Could not get this router working out of the box with my fairly simple network
##Called D-Link tech support and after being walked through all of things I had already tried, I was asked what level of firmware was in my router and instructed to download the latest firmware and told to call back if that didn't fix it
##Guess what? I had the most recent version
##I suspect I was just being blown off
##I'm back to using my LinkSys WRT54GS which is working without any problems
##I'll look for some other solution for an "N" router
[t] A great router!
##I connected this router to my home network in just a few minutes
##Easy as pie
##I have two WIN 98 PC's, one XP notebook, one Vista PC, one MacBook Pro, one iMac and a PS3
##I am mixing 'N' with 'G' and so far it works great
##If I encounter any problems I will update this review
##I did use a cable to connect one of my WIN 98 machines but from what I've seen I don't need to wire any PC to the router to get it to work just fine
software[@]##I did install the included software on this PC with ease
internet[@],speed[@]##I tested the internet speed on each PC and it is by far faster than my old 2WIRE DSL modem/router that up and died on me
##I highly recommend this router
##Fast and easy to install
[t] Great router with lots of options
##I was expecting to improve the signal around my house, but it didn't
##I can get a good signal most of the times though
##It has a lot of options to customize it to your need
[t] Super Fast & Reliable, but Tech Support Blows
##WARNING, the following is true
[t] AMAZING
##Amazing probably does not describe this router
[t] Dlink review
speed[@]##Good product, I have to say that I am not impressed with the range of the router, the speed is good even while gaming and surfing
[t] Not for Network Printing
port[@]##This is a simple and powerful router, but I bought it for the USB port so I could network my printer, and this feature is not so good
installation[@]##This requires of download and installation of the Shareport utility, which is simple and elegant
##You also have to update the firmware, but the dLink support site is pretty easy to use
##But it doesn't work
##It worked initially, and now has stopped (three days after purchase)
##DLink's solution is to uninstall and re-install the utility, and when that didn't work, to power cycle the router
##These are not going to be great solutions if this is what I have to do every time I want to print
##DLink's customer support is fantastic - 24/7, easy to get through, and knowledgable
##I feel a lot like the guy with the heat problem (by the way, I don't have that issue) - I don't want to return this router, but I might have to
##I've been fighting with my three windows laptops - I'm not eager to try to get the two MacBooks to print
[t] Router
##Works great and is much faster than my old Linksys wireless G router
##It was very easy to set up and I haven't had any connection issues
[t] Wireless Router
##On the recommendation of a relative I purchased a wireless router for home use only
##The D-Link unit arrived much sooner then I expected and proved easy to install and set up
##My wife has experienced no problem in it's use and is enjoying her new laptop computer and she leans how to use it
##This is my first purchase from Amazon and I will diffinetely be a repaet customer
##This has been a seamless purchase that has been completely satisfactory
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
[t] Works great as expected
streaming[@]##I purchased this product to replace a DI-524 wireless router that was going bad, starting to interfere with my sensitive video streaming
##The DIR-655 has a little better user interface, which includes wireless signal strength and bandwidth for each connection
##If you like D-Link products as I do, then you know what to expect and setup is relatively pain free
##I am not into auto setup and do not really understand why D-Link pushes it so much
##Signal strength is about the same as the DI-524
##Wireless N does provide a slight boost in bandwidth over G, but nothing to get excited over
##I tried to re-purpose my DI-524 for legacy wireless B traffic
##My suggestion would be don't because of the interference between the two wireless access points
##My sound bridge on the DI-524 was losing synch every time I watched a movie on a video stream connected wireless to the new router
##What I did was to purchase a D-Link wireless N bridge and dumped the legacy traffic
##This serves two purposes
##One, you guarantee a solid wireless connection
security[@]##And two, you eliminate the security hole with WEP protocol
price[@]##All in all, I paid a reasonable price for a solid performing wireless router
##My expectation is that this product will serve me well for 3 to 5 years
[t] Excellent Router
##Got a good deal on this router
##Setup took less than 10 minutes with CD Wizard disc
##Very Good Range and router has worked flawless for the month I have had it
##No compaints from me and I would recommend D-link Dir-655 to anyone looking for an upgrade from your basic wireless router
[t] I like it
##I am very pleased with the D-Link DIR-655
##I was looking for more range and it gave it to me
[t] GREAT!!!!!
##Great Product
##Easy set up
##Less than 15 min
##I love it
##Would definately recommend to others
[t] Excellent router
##This router was easy to set up and works great; it doesn't give me any problems, and I have strong signal all over the house
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##The great thing about upgrading technology late, is it seems that much more amazing
##G level wireless wasn't reaching the whole apartment
##Now, there's no problem
##The Browser interface is much better than Linksys
##There are wizards for setup, though they didn't seem very useful for OS X, and you can save your setting to disk
##It partially replaced a Linksys WCG200 Gateway, which needed to be reset almost every day; the wireless just failed after about 2 years
[t] The Best
##I bought this router to replace the Linksys Dual-band Wireless N Router that I paid over $200 for
##This router runs the Linksys router in the ground
##The ease of installation, speed, coverage area, and reliabilty are 100 times better than the Linksys
##I don't have the heat problem some other reviewers have had
##This router even has a USB connection to connect a printer, etc
##so it can be used on your SOHO network
##I highly recommend this router
[t] Smoking fast! Works with Windows 7...
##I purchased this router last week and it has been up and running for 5 days straight
##I wanted to make sure that it was capable of maintaining a strong and reliable signal for at least few days before writing a review
##Prior to this purchase, I was running the Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G Router
##I did no prior research before purchasing that router, I needed to setup a wireless connection at home and I went out and bought the least-expensive model at my local electronics store
##Fortunately, I was relatively pleased with that product
##After upgrading the firmware (due to some initial problems), I was able to sustain a strong signal for months at a time without a reboot or reset
##It performed well, connecting the sole wireless product I owned (a laptop) to the Internet at satisfactory speeds
##However, I soon needed to connect other devices (such as a Wii, Nintendo DS, XBOX 360, Sony PSP, and an iPod Touch) to the Internet
##At first my Wii would not connect to the Netgear, and I spent hours looking for a solution to my problem on the Internet
##I was able to find one, but had to change to very specific settings in order for the Wii to connect
##(Only B, Channel 11, WEP)
security[@]##I was never able to connect a Nintendo DS or a PSP without disabling all security settings which I had no desire to do
##I also was not happy that I had to finagle the settings extensively to get it to work with these very popular gaming devices
##I also recently bought and iPod Touch and the connection was cumbersomely slow, to the point that a YouTube video would stutter relentlessly
##The last straw was when I realized just how loud that Netgear router actually is
##It has a fan inside and that thing would buzz and buzz and drive me insane
##I finally said "ENOUGH!" and decided to get a new router
##I chose the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router because I wanted to "future proof" my wireless connection
##My interest was also greatly piqued when I read that it has no moving parts inside (thus eliminating the noise from a cooling fan)
##It was a little more than I was willing to spend, but figured it may be worth spending more in order to get a quality product
##The setup was ridiculously easy
##I used the CD which came with the product and the whole process was finished in less than 10 minutes
##The connection is very fast! I am now able to view entire 10 minute YouTube clips on my iPod Touch without any stuttering
##The range of this product is also extraordinary
##Just yesterday I was walking my dog and upon returning home -- just before crossing the street in front of my house -- I heard the familiar "ping" of a new email message on my iPod
##I couldn't believe I could get a connection from that far away! That was at least 50 yards from the router
##All of my other gaming devices connect easily and the router can actually identify them by product in the internal log
##(For instance, when I connected my laptop the router's log read "LAPTOP" or "WII", etc
##) The router's GUI is actually more refined than that or Netgear which is an added bonus
##All in all, I feel like I'm finally getting the most of my high-speed cable Internet connection
##I'm just dissapointed I didn't get this sooner
installation[@]##The installation also worked very well on Windows 7 Beta (RC), but that wasn't too surprising
##NOTE
[t] Works great, works with Motorola SB6120 SURFboard modem
##Had a 5 year old Linksys combo wireless router/modem that was flaking out
##Decided to upgrade to latest-greatest I could afford and am very happy
##Installation was a breeze, just follow the instructions and most of the work is done for you
##There's a lot of tweaking available afterwards if you need it
##NOTE
[t] D-Link Extreme EASY setup
##This D-Link 655 extreme N wireless router was very easy to connect
##Once I typed in the necessary information,it was ready to go
##Connecting our laptop was equally flaxless
##The laptop recognized the D-Link and once I typed in the SSID # it was set
##My wife now complains how fast the laptop reacts
##Connecting my two TIVO's was a simple matter also
##I did have to buy another Tivo brand adapter because because Tivo would not accept the netgear adapter I had been using
##I'm running the D-Link with an HP Pavillion Elite m9280f which has built in 80211N
##I am very pleased with this router and would definitely recommend it
##R
##Sease, Mesa Az
[t] great router, very configurable...
##This is the only "good" wireless router I've owned, the other two wireless routers I have used were just cheapo ones
##You can set access by machine
##I have a son in 6th grade, so I have the router set to cut off his machine at a certain time in the evening on Sundays through Thursdays
##What you do is set up "Schedules"
##So you can enter a Schedule, call it "School Night", and enter a cut off time of say 10
[t] Have yet to see the benifits of Wireless-N
##I thing the DIR-655 is a great router
##I love the USB link (wish I had an NAS drive, but usb link is great alternative)
##I purchased with a DWA-140 USB adapter, but I have yet to get that to work to my liking
##I am not willing to give a poor rating yet because I have yet to truly troubleshoot my problems (I have yet to verify i have the lasted firmware update etc)
##Buyer beware
[t] Excellent product - Good encryption
##Contrary to one of the reviews my D-=Link does not have a heating problem
##It has a much better range than the Verizon wireless modem/router did
##It has WEP and WEPA (use WEPA)
##Make sure your encryption key is strong
##The only problem I had with the wireless was my own fault
##I have an eye problem and was not able to distinguish the difference between a O and a 0
##My suggestion is create the key phrase or password on your wired machine with at least 16 alpha numerics and a couple of special characters write it to a thumb drive, print out a copy and put it in a safe place and then when the operating system asks for the key copy it from the thumb drive to the key field
##Security on wireless is critical so don't forget to encrypt the connection
##Also rename the SSID to something other than D-Link because it has a default password and any hacker can get into it
##I highly recommend this product
[t] D-Link works much better than my old router
##I had to call support during install but they resolved the issue methodically and in a reasonable amount of time
##The router works great and the wireless is excellent
##Highly recommended
[t] Wireless Cable Router
##This model was highly recommended by Consumer Reports and Amazon had the best pricing
software[@],installation[@]##The installation software that came with the router was very easy to follow and set up took less than 15 minutes
##Because I have a desktop, not a laptop, I purchased the router so that I could stream Netflix movies to my television
##It works wonderfully!
[t] Great Fast Router
##I am an IT professional
##Used this router at home office
##Great product, and features
##More than most people will ever use, but better to have too much
##VERY VERY Fast, amazing how much faster it makes everything
##This is overall great router, and it even extends my range from my old 2 antenna linksys
##Now I don't even need range extender in a 3 floor house with it on the top floor
[t] Don't Buy D-Link
##I know you are supposed to rate the product and not the company here but I cannot separate the 2
##I am a network administrator and call tech support quite often
##D-Link is one of the worse
##D-Link products are OK and this router is good for most uses BUT if you have problems like I did you will suffer with their support
##At some point D-Link execs decided that providing good support for their customers is not important
##I could not disagree more
##Just keep this in mind when buying D-Link
[t] Works alright if you don't want to use N
##Update
[t] Worst router so far.
##This router was such a peice of junk, that I don't see how they keep selling them
##It was a nightmare to set up and took me forever to get it to communicate with my laptop
##Then when I finally got it to see my laptop it ran so slow that it took a long time just to load a page
##The dlink rep told me to return it, so I did and the second one did link up, but it dropped the connection all the time and was unusable
##Then it kept getting worse and finally I couldn't even hard wire into it and get into the admin of it
##I'm still looking for a n router that is actually fast and works
##Wish I could rate it with no stars
[t] Deceptive
internet[@]##I bought this router so that I could give internet access to both my desktop PC and my new Macbook Pro laptop
internet[@]##After a few hours, and a call to my internet service provider, I accomplished this very basic task
##(I use verizon DSL and discovered that I needed to go through some steps before the router would be recognized by my ISP
software[@],installation[@]##) Unfortunately, the installation software crashed several times and I had to reboot my Vista PC at least twice--not fun
##Meanwhile, the instructions for Apple users indicated I should load the CD-ROM, but it turns out it only contained a PDF of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for Apple computers
installation[@]##Why? It turns out my Apple laptop recognizes the wireless router right out of the box with no installation needed
##I wish someone had told me that when I started this process! But getting the router up and running is just the first hassle - you also have to get your new network password protected, otherwise anyone can join it
##Here I had major problems - no one should have to wade through complicated terminology like WEP and WAP and lord knows what else just to enable a simple password protection for a home network
##It should just be a one-step automatic process, rather than requiring us to go boldly into advanced setup screens full of techno-gibberish
internet[@],software[@]##The final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap, it's only a trial version -- you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional $40-60 to some unknown company to unlock all the features! Not only that, but you can't even use the trial demo on macs - in order make printer sharing work, you have to buy the full version for macs (but not for PCs)
##That is absurd and downright deceptive
##Exasperated at 3 AM, I called it quits and will be sending this awful, deceptive product back
##I only hope this review spares one person from a similar strife
[t] D-LINK 655
##BOUGHT BY A MISTAKE, WAS THINKING ROUTER MODEM WILL NOT WORK WITH MY SET UP
##I DID NOT LOOK AT IT TILL NOW AND 30 DAY RETURN HAS EXPIRED, MY BAD WILL BE MORE CAREFUL IN FUTURE
[t] Don't buy this!
##I replaced an Airlink 101 (has 2 antenas) w/ this router
##My Airlink got much, much better signal & it was $30 something compared to $70 something for this
##Now it's too late to send back & stuck w/ this junk
##Amazon is awsome, of course
##Just the product that is junk
[t] d-link dir-655 router
##pros, none
##Cons
[t] Not a good wireless router...
##I "traded up" to the DIR-655
##It was no faster than my previous cheaper router
##It won't work with Linux, and is difficult to configure with other systems (Mac Intel, XP, and Linux)
##The set up can be confusing
[t] Beware of Win XP upgrades
##I had this router working fine until I did an update on my systems, then they stopped communicating with it
##I was able to restore one of the systems back before the update, so it works again, but the other is still off-line in XP (Linux works OK)
software[@][u]##This is a known bug in a lot of router  and I am upset that a firmware fix is still not available
##I would have to recommend avoiding any products from this company
[t] Piece of Garbage
##I purchased this item because of all the good reviews, and all the research I did had positive feedback
##Unfortunately my experience of course was a horrible one
##I switched from that garbage service AT&T offers which is U-verse to Charter
##So, I bought this router along with the Motorola SB6120 which was suppose to be great as well
##Both proved to be a piece of crap
##Charter doesn't support the SB6120 from what I read online, but of course the crappy customer support will say they do
##Both of these items have substantial disconnects
##They will connect for no longer then 1 hour
##D link's customer support is the freakin worst too
##These morons had me doing something different every time I called
##Nothing ever worked
##Same result each time
##D link's customer support truly has their head up their ass! Wtf is the problem with these bozos
##And of course they all sound like they are from outer space
##Garbage product with garbage service
##The connection was excellent though when it did work
##Too bad my experience was not like the rest
##I did buy the Linksys E4200 from Best Buy and use it with my new Ubee modem and everything works great now
##If you have Charter you might wanna think twice before purchasing this router as well as the Motorola SB6120
[t] SO SO
##EASY TO INSTALL
##NO HEATING PROBLEM AS STATED ON SEVERAL REVIEWS
##THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT MY LAPTOP (HP PAVILLION CAN'T ACCESS THE WIFI
##FOR SOME REASON MY IPHONE 5 AND MY DAD LAPTOP (AN OLD DELL XPS) WAS ABLE TO CONNECT
##MY FRIEND TRIED EVERYTHING (FLUSH DNS SERVER,REINSTALL, RESET ETC
##)
##FINALLY, WE HOOKED MY OLD ROUTER TO THE DIR 655, AND MY LAPTOP HAS NOW WIFI CONNECTION
##IT'S MOST LIKELY MY LAPTOP PROBLEM, I GUESS I NEED TO BUY A NEW LAPTOP PRETTY SOON
##ANYWAY, SURFING THE THE INTERNET WITH MY IPHONE 5 IS FAST
[t] DONT GET THIS ROUTER IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SIGNAL RANGE!!!!
##My modem is pretty far from my bedroom, so I get very weak WIFI signals with my 4-year-old, 40 dollar Netgear Wireless G router
##So I wanted a replacement to extend/stabilize the signal in my bedroom
##I read a lot of reviews of top single band wireless N router, and this one seems to be the top choice
##HOWEVER, IT IS NOT THE CASE! After setting up this router, I lost the signal in my bedroom completely!!! You can imagine the disappointment
##A 40 dollar Netgear G router from 4 years ago, out-range this supposedly the best single band N router in the current market
##In the end I hooked my Old Netgear back, and used this router as a WIFI extender, took a while to figure out the setup
##This is my 2nd D-link router, and this would be my last for sure
##DON'T GET THIS ROUTER IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SIGNAL RANGE!!!!Just go with Netgear or Linksys(Cisco)
##They are more reliable
[t] Great all around router
##It replaced my old d link router
##Only problem I have with the new one is with Nook
##For some reason I cannot connect my nook to the new router
security[@][u]##I did make one change with the new one and that I added an  key, and the nook can' t handle it
##I have connected three wireless laptops and a wireless printer without any problems
[t] GOOD
##The device is not as good as they say in the reviews, has low signal range
##But everything works fine and normal
[t] Good Wireless Router
##this router has alot of features and can be some what complicated to setup up it's many features
##but for basic use it is simple and very reliable
##It has pretty decent coverage
[t] Slow and was dropping connections...now problem fixed
##There is a older and newer version of this device
##I have the old DIR 655 hardware version A4
##I owned this router for more than three years
##Since last couple of years it was slow and dropping connections
##It is super fast for sometime and then slows down and the cycle repeats
##Now I got to a point where I was getting frustrated and wanted to replace this item
##But as a last resort I double checked if the firmware was uptodate which I did many times in the past
##Current firmware on my router reads as 1
##32NA 06/2009
##Routers web page provides a simple button to check for latest firmware and I pressed the button and it displayed a message that 1
##32NA in fact was the latest version
##Thank god I googled for more information
##Apparently the latest firmware version was 1
##34NA and the buggy router utility was not able to detect that
##So I always thought I was running the latest firmware but to my surprise it was pretty old with nasty bugs
##So I manually download the latest firmware and reconfigured the router and now it is super fast!! Here is the url
[t] Fast Internet
##this router is exactly as i wanted
##it made my wireless super fast and we love it
##D link rocks
[t] Works good
##I have had it for a month and it works fine
##Strong signal
##The only thing is all the annoying blue lights but I have it turned sideways so I don't see them
[t] Solid performance
##I have had this for four years now and it has performed admirably
##Signal is strong and I can use laptops at considerable distance in a seperate building without any difficulty
##Set up can be a little challenging since there are many variables but should not be too difficult for an experienced geek
##I would reccomend it to anyone that needs a reliable wireless router
[t] This Router exceeds my expectations by far!
##I needed to replace an older D-Link model Router, and because of the quality, cost, and reputation, I chose this router
##I had this new Router running and integrated within about 20 minutes
##The instructions and set up were very easy
[t] Most Customizable Router I Can Find
port[@]##This router allows you to setup your own custom rules and has a port forwarding capability
##In addition, you can save your setups to an external file so if you want to switch between a server configuration or general user, it's real easy
##I would give it 5 stars but you can't manually set the traffic priority
[t] Excellent Router
##We are using the router for 2 years now and We love it
##I have 4 of the same router on different locations
##Never fail and never have to be rebooted
##Highly recommended
[t] Love it
##good range
##i can pick up wifi in my backyard
##nice to be able to facetime with my family while i am at work and they are playing in the backyard
##I have had it since March 2012 and I haven't had to reset it
##Highly recommended
[t] Hopeful
##When I received the router it was extremely difficult to get it to work on our network
##I have a lot of computer experience and this router tested my patience
##After receiving the router and installing I ended up on Tech Support for about 2 hours trying to solve the problems
##The end result after making all the changes was that it did work
##So far the router has been working great and have had zero drops or problems
##The reason for the minus one star is simply for the intial hook up
[t] mostly very good
speed[@]##hardware and technology seem to be very nice and work great and good speed
##the only issue i have is the web config seems very buggy and hasnt been updated since 2010 is what the update screen indicates
[t] JGarcia33
##I checked all the ratings on this and asked IT experts and this was the one of the top picks and I can truly say it works great
##better then the old one I had
##It also, his a Longer range too
##O'yea and the price, You can't beat it
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Wireless Router
##This router is terrific
##Our family is very pleased with how fast our computers are
##It arrived quickly, and was easy to set up
[t] blasts through walls
##I love this Wifi Router !! It throws the signal over the the river and through the woods and down long hallways and into lots of rooms !!
[t] Shareport doesn't work
internet[@]##The router works ok, used it for surfing the internet only and even then it had moments of lag and web pages would sit and load for a long time periodically
##The shareport feature never worked even after I tried to add it to the list of approved devices on my firewall settings
##Customer support is a separate company from D-Link and wants you to pay money for any help offered
##That was the deal breaker
##My suggestion and next router, Airport Express (maybe Airport Extreme)
software[@],port[@]##Can print from both PC and Mac without relying on some bogus software that supposedly switches user control of the USB port (I'm sure that'll work reliably every time
##)
[t] It is too good
##I have hand this router for almost a year and I have absolutely no problems with it
##I test its range booster claims by walking down the street in the my neighbor, where there are a lot of interference from other routers
##Yet I was able to go 70 yards away from my router before I lost connection
##The only bad thing about this router is that it gets very hot and a suggestion would be to somehow lift it up
##Note
[t] A great unit when things go right
##I have been using the D-Link DIR-655 for just a few days
installation[@]##Initial installation APPEARED to go smoothly and the unit worked OK for Internet access but there were some strange problems when I tried to do Remote Desktop Client access over the LAN
##Automatic backups were getting skipped because the backup program could not find the server
##I put my old router back in service and the problems vanished
##As I investigated, I discovered that there was something truly strange going on in the handling of NetBIOS on the LAN
installation[@][u]##I tried a restore to factory defaults and re-did the 
installation[@][u]##After the reset to factory settings the  wizard would not run properly so I had to do the  manually
##This time it worked, and the router is functioning just fine
installation[@]##There were no recurrences of the odd problems on the initial installation
##The only real problem I had with configuration the second time around is that for some reason the router did not want to accept the time zone/daylight setting information
##So, the good news is that this is a fast router
##Once it is properly configured it seems to work great
##Range is better than my old router, and I haven't had any connection problems with connections using any of the wireless protocols
port[@]##I have not owned the router long enough to comment on durability or long term stability, and I have not used the USB port so I don't know anything about its functionality
##I don't use WiFi Protected Setup so I can't comment on that
##The bad news is that D-Link email support is a total, complete waste of time
##It was obvious from their email responses that the techs were giving out boilerplate advice without even bothering to read the user information I submitted
installation[@]##The installation 'wizard' is apparently a bit flaky, and every meaningful configuration change during manual configuration requires a LONG reset process
##As best I could tell there was no way to make the necessary changes in all the various categories and then reset the router once
##It had to go through a painfully long reset after changing items on each page of the interface
##The price/performance for the router are good enough I would probably buy it again, but I can't recommend it to anybody who is likely to need meaningful tech support
[t] Nice and Easy
##Bought this along with a Roku
##The DIR-655 was so easy to setup it was almost too easy
##Follow a couple of steps and you are done
##Roku picked it up and all was done
##Great purchase
[t] Works Perfect for Me!
##This is my first purchase on amazon and first review so bear with me
##I had this router for about a month now
##I hooked it up to a my giga-bit D-Link DGL-4100 router and set up my DIR-655 as an access point (just turned off DHCP on it) and it has been working great so far with no issues
##I tested the range on it and it is amazing I can go way back in my backyard (approx
##200ft) and still have a good connection
##I used a Toshiba NB305 when testing the range
##The giga-bit feature is also a plus with this router
##The reason I bought this router was based on the positive reviews that other amazon users had left and they were right
##Many Thanks!
[t] Doesn't work as advertised.
##It doesn't work as advertised
##but what product does?I was at least hoping for a 10-15% improvement in coverage area over my previous Linksys WRT54GS 811G router, but I'm afraid that the coverage is about the same
##The router was extremely easy to set up, and speeds are fine
##I would still recommend this router to anyone that doesn't already have a wireless router
##but if you are looking for better wireless coverage, you might be disappointed
[t] Super easy to install as replacement
##I had an existing D-Link wireless router (DI-624) that had started to drop connections frequently
##As I use this for work it was becoming a problem
security[@]##Ordered the DIR-655 and found it super easy to install it in place of my old one because all you had to do was (1) plug all the cables into the very same slots as the old one and (2) run the setup CD and type in the same SSID and security key as the old one and
##that was it
##My laptop was able to connect wirelessly on the first try
##I am running 3 machines with Xp in case that makes a difference
##I have not tried the USB printer option so have no opinion on that part
[t] Simple
##I have never set up a wireless network and was a little apprehensive about doing so
##It was so easy a child could do it! The startup DVD was not compatible with my Mac so I used the quick 1,2,3 steps on the back of the box and it literally took me five minutes
##It has not lost connectivity, it is relatively quick, and it looks nice to boot
##I would strongly recommend this router
[t] Great when it works.. Brick when it doesn't
internet[@]##Works great then every few days starts to slow down and finally won't allow access to internet
internet[@]##You can hit other drives/computers on network but it won't let you out to the internet
##Won't let you log into the router
##so you get to reset it so you can get it going again
##I am seriously thinking about connecting a timer to the power supply to just cycle power every day at midnight
##Nice features but not reliable if you need to depend on it for hosting services / remote networking back to your home etc
##Disappointing
[t] great router, a little tricky to configure with non D-link products
##That's a great router and the performance is excellent
##But I have problems to use with my usb tp-link wireless adapter with a disconnections repeteadly and at last with my ps3 and my ps3 media server restart the video playback
##that's very bad
##Plus the wireless bridge configuration was avoid for the new firmware
##That's not help because pleople who was looking for an option different than WDS was forced to buy an Access Point additional
[t] Great so far
##Great router so far (two weeks)
##Download the latest firmware off the dLink website and install it if you own an iPad
[t] Awesome Wireless Router
##This router is SO much better than any other wireless router I've used
installation[@][u]##I'm a fairly expert user and I didn't use the  software; I just manually configured the system
##Very easy and intuitive - no problems at all to get the system working
##No need to read manuals with the excellent help system in the admin
price[@]##The number of features at this price point is amazing
##It's fun to geek out perusing all the features in the system
internet[@]##I especially like the ability to limit the hours my kids can access the internet
##Excellent compatibility with all matter of devices
[t] OK Router - Horrendous support.
##The router is okay - nothing special about it
##God help you if it's broken or you have trouble however
##D-Link might list their support contact #s everywhere but it's a nightmare
##Expect the following
[t] Works with Mac Book Pro - don't use Network Magic
speed[@]##Works with a Mac Book Pro! I wanted an n-series router for speed and because I kept loosing connection on my Linksys
##I have 5 PC's, a Mac Book Pro and I am a big apple fan
##However, I chose the D-Link DIR-655
speed[@]##I got the speed and I have good, solid connections
##I love the blue lights; they go well with my Vonage box
##I used a Dymo labeler to label the lights; D-Link didn't
##Don't install Network Magic!!! This is why I rated it a 4 instead of a 5
##It is pretty, but you don't need it; the browser interface works fine
##Network Magic magically send my PC (PC is on LAN, Mac Book Pro is wireless) into a loop so tight I couldn't do anything
##Task Manager couldn't kill it
##Finally went to Sysinternals, installed ProcExp and even it couldn't kill it, but I was able to set the dispatch priority to 4 (idle)
##This slowed the 100% CPU loop down enough I could get to system restore
##I restored WinXP SP2 to an earlier time and got rid of Network Magic
software[@]##See an earlier review about "One BIG negative about this software (Network Magic) is that it takes over all print sharing and folder sharing from Windows XP
##"Gigabit LAN router (don't forget Cat-6 for Gigabit, not Cat-5 that comes with router)
##Apple Airport does not have Gigbit LAN
##Stealth ports

##Hackers pinging random IP addresses won't get a response from you and won't know you are there
##Apple Airport is not stealth, but sends replies so the hackers know you are there
port[@]##USB port is apparently only for config backup to a thumb drive
##(although you can save these on your PC hard drive and do not have to use a thumb drive) No disk or printer support
port[@]##Apple Airport supports disk and printers on a USB port
##I also find the router log VERY interesting
##Found an intruder on my system until I realized it was my Vonage box which I had forgotten about

##Found many, many probes from China, Korea, etc
##that D-Link denied

##and I haven't found anyone or any threads in forums that shows how
##I never really cared much for it initially
##After experimenting with it for a few days (which annoyed the heck out of me), I disabled it, and that was that
##or so I thought
##until last week
##Securespot came back somehow
##On the router setting, it was still set as disabled, but it was back
##I had to re-disable it by enabling it first, then disable it in the router setting
##Odd I thought, but it worked
##but again the next night same thing happened again
##then the next night, and then the next night and so on
##Google search again
##found bunch of threads on dlink forums by frustrated users with same problem - apparently some kind of problem from securespot servers that resets the settings each night
##There were no resolution on any of the forums though
##Some replies from dlink staff either blaming the users initially, then in the later posts blame the company that created securespot and claims it's not their problem
##Once again, I repeat this comes with the router firmware, and you cannot remove it
##At the time, you can only disable it - which gets reset everyday and you have to re-enable, then re-disable each day
##It's a real pity because I actually liked the router
##but had I known I'd be married to Securespot at the same time, I would have never bought this router
##So buyers, beware, do the research on securespot (just google "dlink securespot" or "dlink securespot disable"), make sure you really want securespot and understand what you are buying
##or wait until dlink provides another firmware without securespot
[t] Repeatedly rebooting by itself, klutzy interface, miserable install process for SecureSpot users
##When I upgraded the firmware on this router (from v1
##21 to 1
##32NA) did I create a bug-riddled, unusable device? Or are my problems really just a hardware manufacturing problem?I'm a SecureSpot user, but my DLink DSD-150 -- the little SecureSpot box that filters websites for the entire network -- broke
##Rather than replacing my failed DSD-150 with another, I bought this DIR-655 because it has built-in SecureSpot
##That it's an N-network is just an extra nice feature, but I won't need it yet
installation[@]##The installation was very frustrating
##Keep in mind, this is only the second router I've ever installed -- I don't do this for a living
##So when I'm greeted with an instruction poster that says, "IMPORTANT
[t] The best & fastest wireless & wired router out when initially released!
##I purchased this router because i wanted a faster wireless speeds especially for video
##In order for the ethernet connections to keep up with the faster wireless speeds this was the first unit out that also offered gigabit speeds for the ethernet ports
##Prior to that virtual no router offered gigabit speeds for the ethernet ports
##I was not disappointed and after using this for nearly 2 years (maybe more) I am still extremely pleased with this router
##In conjunction with the Extreme N wireless cardbus adapter for my media center laptop and the Extreme N PCI adapter for my Vista (yuck) PC I attained continuous speeds of 300mbps throughput
##Because the wireless speeds were faster than previous versions of the routers with ethernet connections D-Link installed gigabit ethernet ports on this baby as well
##This router in conjunction with the D-Link Extreme N receivers provided blazing speeds and an astounding range allowing me to work much farther away from the router, in some cases increasing distance by 75%
##Best of all, even though this is still Draft N this unit is firmware upgradeable so that when the final N standard is set in 2009 you can simply flash upgrade this unit
##I purchased this almost immediately after its release and have not regretted this purchase at all
security[@]##It is easy to set up and offers several layers of security
##Best of all are the blazing speeds and excellent distance range from base unit
##There is a gaming version available but if you are using this for downloading video or shuttling video from unit to unit this router is excellent for that
##I would imagine that this also works extremely well for gaming
##I have even seen one person use this to stream HD programming around their house
price[@]##Best of all the price now is much lower than before
##I've tried different brands over the years but I am now a D-Link fan and will remain so
internet[@]##This router has NEVER failed me or gone down and I'm an internet road hog!
[t] Questionable biz practices. Buy this & get stuck on SecureSpot 's webpage
##DLINK really really has questionable business practices
##(Note
[t] Comcast README
##My router shipped on Jun 13 2008 with the 1

##The DHCP client didn't work work with my Comcast cable modem, and I had to upgrade to 1

[t] Great Little Router with Good Horsepower
##I have been a regular customer of D-Link over the years and when you find something that works well you become a returning customer
##When it came time to upgrade to wireless, I did the research of all the choices available and still selected my go-to company D-Link
##I am glad I did
##I am using wireless G and the range is about the same
##I get two bars from basement to 2nd floor using D-Link PCMCIA adapters
##Even though it is draft N it still works great for G
##First, the setup on this is relatively simple, even for a novice
installation[@]##You insert the disk and the installation walks you through each step in the process with visual pictures with flashing parts highlighted to help guide you to what you need to do
installation[@][u]##If you follow the directions step by step you should have a flawless 
installation[@]##Second, about updating the firmware, you should do this as part of the installation
##It should be simple to do but understand that when you upgrade you will lose your router settings
##D-Link has provided for this
##Here is the recommended process
[t] stay away
##Just as a little background of myself
##I have been playing with technology for the last 15 years
##I have a bunch of certs, 4 of them pertaining to networking, and I have a bachelors degree in computer engineering
##With that said, stay away from this router
##The specs and design make it very enticing for sure
##I have had to have my power supply replaced twice since I've owned it
##which has only been 3 months
##The thing needs constant restarts for your connection to be any faster than a snails pace
##Not to mention all the useless crap they put on it
software[@]##The main example is the "secure soft" software
##It is absolutely TERRIBLE
##They give you a free trial of it, cool right? Yea it might be cool, if after your trial, it didn't still bug the crap out of you, even with it completely disabled in the settings
##Sometimes restarts are needed because it will give you secure soft errors and wont let you get out to the net
security[@]##It does have very nice features, the security on it is great
##The range this router gets is also very good
##Its just not worth the constant headaches it gives you
##I had used linksys for the last 10 years and hadn't had a single problem
##Only other good thing I can say about it, is the customer service in the rma department was very good, and all I had to do was email a pdf of my invoice to get them to ship me the power supply
##Twice
[t] Tough to configure with HughesNet
internet[@]##Found that the DIR-655 is very difficult to configure when using HughesNet satellite internet
internet[@]##Problem being that the router wants to confirm that you have an internet connection before allowing you to configure the router
##The major problem is that HughesNet modems operate at 192
##168
##0
##1 and the DIR-655 come configured at 192
##168
##0
##1
##Thus you have figure out how to change the IP address of the DIR-655 before you can get it to configure
##and that takes some work
##D-Link should make it very easy to change the IP address before configuring!!!
[t] Couldn't Get Wireless Xp Portable to work
##Installed nicely, but I couldn't get my IBM Thinkpad Xp to work correctly
##In both wireless and wired mode, the XP was extremely slow when using the browser
##After hours, tech support was no help
##I returned it and bought the Linksys WRT160N which worked immediately for all my computers including the XP
##Also, the WRT160N seeemed to have better range (but not by much)
[t] I love this thing
##I bought this because my old router was intermittently dropping connections
##I was worried that it was my ISP or something
##I got it, and had it setup and running in like 15 minutes
##It's been running for weeks with no dropped connetions or restarts
##I encourage anyone with cheap little router that has issues to upgrade to this type of product
##Sometimes, you get what you pay for, and this is one of those cases
[t] BEST ROUTER EVER
##Before this one, I had four routers, non of which worked as good as this one
##I had Airport Extreme, 2 Linksys Routers, and a motorola router
speed[@],streaming[@]##They either disconnected (lost wireless signal) every 5 seconds or did not have enough speed for video streaming (like youtube)
##This one had worked flawlessly out of the box
##Upgrade the firmware to take advantage of a fantastic under-advertised feature, USB sharing
##You can plug in a printer, usb hard drive, or anything else USB and it will be shared among all the PC's connected to it (no mac support yet), wired and wireless
##Like a network printer or HD
##Besides that, everything is very reliable and lightning fast
##Gigabit Ethernet and 802
##11n Wireless gives it the fastest connection around
##I have no complaints with this besides USB sharing lacking support for mac
[t] Excellent gigabit + wireless-n router
##No need to look further, this is it
##This router has all the features and the performance one could want (at a reasonable price)
port[@]##Gives you a gigabit router/switch (the WAN port is also gigabit, unlike some other similar products), and trouble-free wireless-n as well
##I always use the "manual" configuration modes, so cannot comment on the wizards etc
##But I found the setup well organized and easy to follow
##The advanced config stuff is separated, so you don't have to go there if you don't want/need to do so
##Oh and by the way, you can also use this as a wireless access point if you want to, although the documentation doesn't say anything
##Just make sure you do this
[t] Don't waste your money
##I bought this 2 months ago, because my wireless 802
##b network did not have the range to cover the whole house
##I was hoping that this router would increase the range by 20 feet
speed[@]##Not so!Despite good speed (130 Mps), there is no range increase and it is maddingly slow
##It is also hard to set up
##Only buy this if you are an expert
##I had to get an electrician to run cap2 cable 50 feet, and a Network specialist to add an antenna
##The signal is still only 2 bars
##He said I may need a repeater
##The problem is that I have an old house, with stucco walls, which play havoc with wireless
##$400 later, I am no better than my wireless 802
##b
##Shame on me!
[t] Works for Apple TV
##I bought this to wirelessly connect to my Apple TV unit
##Works perfectly and set up was easy
[t] Works Great- Easy Installation
##Replaced an older Ethernet only (4 port) router with this Wireless/Ethernet router
##I use this router, it's 4 Ethernet connections and a switching box, to run 3 LAN/Ethernet wired PC's, a LAN printer, , and use the wireless feature for a MAC laptop
##This router is fast and I have not experienced any dropouts since installing it 3 weeks ago
##Wireless range and signal strength are very good
##Installation instructions were well written and the process went easy
##I mounted the box vertically and instructions clearly show various antenna positions for vertical mounting
##I had a minor problem figuring out where in the DLink site to activate Wireless Security
##I called DLink Technical Support, was connected right away and received clear instructions
##Very satisfied with my purchase
[t] Very good even with G band
##Great product
##I'm using it with the PS3 as well
##Just remember to shut down every thing, including the computer after installing the router otherwise it wont work
##Then turn on the cable modem, the router and the computer (in this order)
[t] A Wireless Router with NO Outages!
##I've had my D-Link DIR-655 wireless router for about a month now and am very satisfied with this product
internet[@]##Before getting the DIR-655, I was using an ethernet switch but at times, it would cut-out becasue if you have more than one ethernet device running at the same time like the internet (computer) and a TV (with ethernet), the switch would get confused and cut out
##Since getting this router and upon set up, I have had absolutely no interruptions
##Set up was easy and yes, I too updated the firmware which was also easy
##My place is not that big but I have the router on one end of the home with my laptop at the other end (in my bedroom most of the time) and I still have 4 to 5 bars for strenght
internet[@],speed[@]##The speed of my internet service also improved altough the difference was not very much but I did notice a difference
##I suggest that when you first get the router, you follow the instructions step by step
##I have read reviews where some people have issues with connectivity when first setting up
##I can tell you with wireless routers or any router for that matter, would need to pick up your IP address and if not done correctly, this is where issues may creep up
software[@]##The DIR-655 does have instructions that are clear cut, even the software will take you through the set up process step by step and as long as you connect the devices according to the instructions and you turn on and allow the applicable devices to boot up in a certain order, then you will not have a problem at all
internet[@]##Again, set up was very easy and have been enjoying fast, worry free and interruption free internet service ever since
price[@]##I highly recommend this product for the price
##Happy surfing!
[t] not that bad
##Not that bad
##good for home use
##sometimes I'm losing wireless connection and have to wait 30 sec to 2 mins
##good for home use!
[t] great router - so far
##Purchased this to address a marginal G - router I used previously, that constantly required resetting and did not provide a strong signal in many areas
##This new router has worked much better so far
[t] D-Link DIR-655 - Value For Money
##I bought this router 3 months ago and it has been working without any major issues
##I never notices it heating too much ( as by some other customers)
##I am using it against 2 laptops , one desktop and my panasonic TV
##The only issue that I see is compatability with Wireless B and G devices
##With wireless N the range is pretty good but one of my laptop is still on
##11B and on 20 feet radius to signal drops to 1 bar
##I purchase DLink USB adapter (D-Link DWA-125 150Mbps Wireless N USB Adapter ) and now I get 100 percent reception
##My neighbour has Cisco Wireless G router and my laptop (without USB Adapter) gets 90% reception
##No problem installing the equipment
##All in all a good product
##D-Link DWA-125 150Mbps Wireless N USB Adapter
[t] Good as long as you don't have to restart.
##I don't understand once in a while it gets disconnected and I can't use it again unless I do full reset
##I know it has to do with dynamic IP but it should not happen
##Apart from this it is the best router I have owned
##The range of the router is good
##I live in apartment, my friends upstairs and downstairs both use my router without any problem
internet[@]##Sometime internet is slow but its not the routers fault it is just the crappy internet we have in our apartment
##Setup was very easy
##I did not had any problem hooking it up and did it without looking at manuals
##Pros
[t] Good buy
##Received as a gift
speed[@]##Set it up in 15 minutes, smooth and speed is great
##Will see how long it will last, but very please with performance (running laptop, blue ray and Wii)
[t] Makes a great addition to existing router
##I have an ActionTec "G" router from Verizon that I need to keep in order for remote DVR and other FIOS TV features to work (and be supported)
##I wanted to add an "N" access point to my house, so I put this in an upstairs closet and ran a Cat5-E cable to it
##I do know a bit about networking, so I skipped the CD and just opened the browser interface and set up the D-Link over my network
##After matching the newly assigned SSID and WPA2 passphrase on my daughter's laptop the connection worked flawlessly
##The signal is excellent anywhere in the house
speed[@]##I don't yet have a gigabit switch, so I couldn't test high speed transfers from our LaCie NAS
##It may seem like overkill to use this simply as an access point, but the dedicated units aren't any less expensive and don't have great reviews
##A power-over-ethernet unit would have avoided the need to put an outlet in the closet, but they cost a whole lot more and I don't have any POE switches to connect one to
[t] Great wireless unit
##I have experienced almost all of the positives of the DIR-655, so I am pleased with this device and recommend it
installation[@]##The one issue I had in setting it up was with the installation CD because it would not work for me (other reviewers mentioned this too)
installation[@]##If you get an error message do not worry because the manual installation is straight forward--just refer to the instructions on the Quick Install Guide and the user manual that's provided on CD-ROM
##By the way, the unit runs at a normal temperature for me, so no heat concerns
[t] A great wireless router, just as most all of its users agree.
##Setup was painless and simple
##The set up CD made all the correct settings and the unit was working in my system within 10 minutes of opening the package
##The only downside of the set up was that its so automated it didnt ask me for any prefence choices
##For example, I always hide my SSID rather than broadcasting it, so I had to get into advanced settings after the router was going to change it
##Not a big deal but I suppose a few feedback questions during initial set up would have been nice
##The only reason I have given this router four stars instead of five is because the blue LEDs on the front of the unit are just unreasonably bright
##My router is on a shelf in a spare bedroom of the house, and I had to cover over the front of the router to dim it enough so that it wasnt disturbing to a guest that was sleeping in the room
##There's no reason the LEDs need to be that bright other than maybe for showing it off(?) but I dont know what DLink would think thats important for most users
##They could have used smaller LEDs or stuck in a higher impedance resistor on the circuit board and toned it down to what I'd consider a normal brightness
[t] Wireless HD
speed[@]##This is without a doubt one of the best routers for both wireless signal range and speed
##Originally purchased to replace a 54G wireless router because a signal was not obtainable through a single wall, the Extreme N generated a maximum strength signal almost immediately on every wireless devices in the house
##Even better, about a year later a WiFi Network Blu-Ray Player was dropped off by Santa and a few tweaks to set a Static IP made it possible to stream 1080p HD movies compressed in *
##mkv files through this amazing router
##Now an entire 500+ Blu-Ray movie archive is stored on a computer in my home office while all the movies are streamed wirelessly to a WiFi Network Blu-Ray Player in my living room
##Thanks D-Link for making a product ahead of its time
[t] Thank God I Found This Router
##First off I like to say I bought this router to replace my old Cisco-Linksys WRT110 RangePlus Wireless Router I bought a few years back and at the time I only had it running my PS3, laptop and me and my fianc&eacute;s Blackberrys shared the network from time to time
##Now we have 2 laptops, Desktop PC, PS3, Xbox, External HD & 2 Droid phones
streaming[@]##Long story short the more things I added to it the more my signals dropped which is to be expected but started to get pretty annoying because while streaming Netflix in one room and playing ps3 in another the PS3 always lost right along with any other wireless signals
##I don't know a ton about PC's but I am smart enough to setup my homes network so after doing some reading this router was one of the 3 highly rated ones
##I must say I am very impressed so far and I of course I had to put it through a test or 2 upon setting it up which I have to tell you, was a complete no brainer
##I didn't even use the Setup CD that came with the thing
##I set it all up though the web browser similar to the linksys router I had before and it was a piece of cake I was pretty proud of myself
streaming[@][u]##So of course now that I have everything setup I plug in everything that can be wired or wireless and start web surfing, movie  and game playing online
streaming[@][u]##Not one hiccup "Knock On Wood" I've yet to drop connection once from any of my wirelessly connected laptops and no disconnect while  media via Xbox, PS3 or my external HD
##There is one thing though the blue LEDs are super bright so make sure the routers not somewhere you plan on sleeping
##My routers in my living room next to my entertainment center so when the lights are off it actually looks pretty cool and at night I don't have to turn on the light to walk through
##LONG STORY SHORT I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR AND IT'S DOING EXACTLY WHAT I HOPED IT WOULD!!!THANK GOD!!!
[t] A featureful well-designed device!
##I have to agree with the many positive reviews here
##I've been a long-term Linksys user
##Recently I noticed a decline in the overall quality of their product line
##I'd been using a third-party firmware as well to increase/tune performance, ultimately finding it wasn't worth the bother
##I decided to look to amazon
##com customer reviews for better recommendations
##Here I found the D-LINK DIR-655, which received the most positive reviews
##I was surprised, as I'd always associated D-LINK with lower-end products, for some reason
price[@]##Don't let the price deceive you; this unit is packed full of features that actually work very well
##The device was easy to set up
##I use a Mac and didn't need to use the disc-based setup; rather the default web page has a similar tool to get you started
##It does a very good job at warning you about the need to reboot, allowing you to postpone
##They've coded their web pages such that it will automatically refresh to the rebooted unit
##Very smoothly done
##People have complained here that the default router address is 192
##168
##0
##1 versus 192
##168
##1
##1 -- clearly they haven't read the manual, as you can change this in the router configuration! Please people, read the manual before you post negative critique
##Yes, the LEDs are very bright! I placed this on top of my television, as that's where my cable modem resides
##It is a bit distracting, like a mini disco
[t] Easy to use, lots of configurations - both for novices and pros
##I am replacing a returnedApple AirPort Extreme Base Station (Gigabit) MB053LL/Awith this router after our previous D-Link router started rebooting excessively after 5 years
##We have 2 dedicated iMacs and 1 powerbook, 1 Apple TV, 1 HP printer, several external hard drives, and 1 gaming hungry Wii on our home network
##We also have 3 iphones/touches and the oh-so-troublesome Nintendo DS coming on and off the network
##My husband has a newly developed addiction toCall of Duty
[t] Very nice router
##I just upgraded my home network by replacing an 9-year old Netgear RT314 router with a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit RouterD-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##I was fortunate to receive an A3 revision with the 1
##11 firmware already loaded (I wouldn't touch the recent 1
##20 firmware)
##I also purchased 2 D-Link DGS-2208 8-port GB switchesD-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop Switchthat replaced a single 10/100 switch
##Prior to installing the DIR-655, I logged in to the RT314's web server (192
##168
##0
##1) using IE and printed all of the configuration settings
##Next, I used IE to display the web pages (192
##168
##100
##1) of the Motorola SB4200 cable modem (I have Road Runner Business Class) and printed all of its settings (I plan to get Time Warner to replace the SB4200 with a DOCSIS 2
##0 cable modem in the near future)
##I was particularly concerned that Time Warner would detect the changed MAC address and interrupt my service, but that was not the case
software[@]##I disdain unnecessary software installs, and so disregarded the quick setup CD in favor of using the DIR-655's wizards and manual configuration web pages
##My setup method is to leave settings at the default unless I encounter conditions that require a change
##The steps I took were
[t] Very stable router, good aesthetic design
##A few months ago, I had been looking for a stable router that can decently broadcast a wifi signal in a 2-story building with the router being on the second floor and the computers on the first floor (with numerous walls in between)
##Prior to this router, I tried using the stable Linksys WRT54G router coupled with a few WRE54G range extenders however the range extenders proved to be too difficult to install and maintain (frequent rebooting)
##Next, I tried a Linksys SRX400 Mimo-G router which was a little better although the signal was still too weak on the first floor (~30% signal)
##Finally, with this D-Link N router, I'm able to maintain about 60-65% signal and about 36 Mbps
##The computers on the first floor all use the D-Link USB 2
##0 802
##11n Adapter USB adapter
##Although the signal isn't as strong as I'd like it to be, the router is VERY stable (hasn't needed a reboot and hasn't crashed in the 5 months that it's been installed)
##Surfing/downloading/uploading has been smooth
##Installing this router was fairly easy
##If you have prior experience with setting up routers, this D-Link should be a breeze
##The only downside I can find for this router is that whenever the router requires a reboot (after a change in settings), the reboot may take a little longer than other models (up to 1 minute sometimes)
##To improve the wireless signal, I found that utilizing a D-Link 7700AP access point will increase the signal to about 75%
##Using a Hawking HSB2Hawking HiGain Signal Booster version 2 - HSB2increases the signal to about 85-90%
##Further adding aTRENDnet 14 dBi Outdoor High Gain Directional Antennabrings our wireless signal to 100% (although the Trendnet antenna must be placed carefully for optimal coverage)
antennas[@]##While our day-to-day usage doesn't really necessitate a 100% signal (75% seems to be sufficient), it's good to know that this router can be enhanced with third-party antennas and boosters if it is necessary (and still remain stable)
[t] Fabulous!
##This product replaced a Netgear WGR-614v1
##Compared to the Netgear, the wireless range is significantly further, and I get 75% signal strength on my MacBook throughout the house now (vs
##25% before)
##802
##11n is significantly faster than 802
security[@]##11g, and of course the upgraded WPA security is better than WEP
##I disabled traffic shaping 'cos I don't play networked games, so I have no opinion on that
##The Gigabit hub works well, and I get 400Mbps transfers between computers (4x faster than 100Mbps), probably limited by the hard drive
##Excellent product
[t] Awesome router
##Considering D-Link routers get at least 85-95 in expert tech reviews and Linksys and Belkin get between 50-70 (which I can justify from the pain of using one) im glad I went with D-Link
##Best routers period!
[t] Excellent but not perfect
##I bought this router to increase the range of my network, since I generally stray more than 100 feet away from the base, between several walls
##One problem I found was that the router kept assigning the same IP to two different laptops if the laptops were too close together
##This meant one would lose its connection, or both wireless connections would slow to a painstaking crawl
##With channel scan enabled, by default, it kept dropping the wireless connection when it switched from a weaker channel to a stronger one although my old router did this too
##It took me about four days, and lots of effort, to figure it all out
##D-Link tech support was an absolute joke
##For example, two techs told me using WEP encryption does not disable N speeds, although the documentation clearly states this
##I figured out that I was only able to obtain N speeds using WPA TKIP encryption using my wireless N card
##I am finally up and running and the router is excellent after tons of effort on my part
##So if you are going to stray far from the base often I would suggest you disable Auto channel scan, use WPA TKIP encryption if you want to get N speeds, manually assign IP addresses if you are on DHCP (that is, cable) to prevent wireless lockups
##It really sucks that I had to learn all this to get the best of this router
##Aside from the channel scan issue, my Linksys WRT54GX4 never gave me these problems and worked close to flawlessly until I recently decided to replace it (because I wanted markedly better performance)
speed[@]##This router is generally faster in real world situations, although my WRT54GX4 consistently posts faster download speeds on online speed tests, for example an average 4MB/s download rate for the WRT54GX4 vs a 1
##2 MB/s rate for this DIR-655 on the same cable connection
##Maybe it's the QoS engine, which slows what it designates as uncritical?On a last note, the wireless N card doesn't register any signal at distances greater than 100 ft, but g works fine
##So, IT REALLY IS NOT TRUE THAT AT N-SPEEDS THE FARTHER YOU ARE THE BETTER
##Overall, it is an excellent router, but I resent having to do so much just to get it working correctly
##Isn't N supposed to be better? The experts are right, this technology is just not ready yet
##Enjoy it for what it's worth
speed[@]##By the way, this router did increase my range and my speed on a wireless-G connection
##But, I am left thinking my old router wasn't too bad after all
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router Review
##Purchasing this item was fast and complete
##I have never had a wireless network in my home before so being a novice at hooking it up and getting it to work with my system was a little daunting for me
##Hooking up this wireless router to my computer was a breeze but getting it to communicate with our X-Box was a little more difficult but after calling D-link and talking to one of their tech reps I was able to configure this router to work and it works EXCELLENT!!! Great product and I would recommend it to anyone
[t] Great router, flawed firmware and support
##I have had this router since it was originally released
##The first few firmware revisions were a little bumpy, but the problems I experienced were sorted out relatively quickly and the router was fast and stable - easily the best router I've owned (and there have been many)
##Then everything went wrong
##Pretty much every firmware release since and including 1
##20 has had serious bugs
##The router froze with regularity and had to be power cycled
##The wireless would restart frequently, temporarily disconnecting all wireless clients
##Worse, with firmware 1
##31, downgrading to earlier releases is no longer possible
##I upgraded to this firmware with the hopes of solving some of the issues that I was having, only to find that it didn't fix the problems and I could no longer revert to 1
##11, the last stable version in my experience
##Months have passed with no resolution to the freezing issue and those of us who upgraded to 1
##3x are stuck with essentially useless devices
##So, overall, I have to give this excellent piece of hardware 2 stars because of D-Link's awful recent firmware and support
internet[@]##If it was possible to revert to an older firmware, perhaps I would feel differently, but I have been forced to replace the router with a non-D-Link device as I work from home and need reliable internet connectivity and VOIP
[t] wow!
##This wireless is to replace my old burned out D-624 Dlink
##This one is amazing, the connection range is longer and doesn't drop connection like the old one
##Very happy with the purchase
[t] Buyer Beware-Rev B Version
##The D-Link Extreme-N is a great router-that's why this was the second one I have owned
##However, Amazon ships the Rev B version of the router, which I understand is usually sold in non-US markets
##I could not get the router to work with Apple Filing Protocol, nor does it support Apple's Time machine backup
##But it's not just a Mac problem-the Rev B also has a bug that does not allow support for CIFS protocols
##After numerous frustrating calls to D-Link support, I finally reached a second level support person who was aware of the problem and replaced the router with a Rev A version, which works wonderfully
##Be sure to get Rev A, or buy elsewhere where you can
[t] D link
##Great router, replaced my belkin POS router
##Publish websites,view multiple sites, fast, great signal
##No drop out
##I love it
[t] Wow
##took some time setting up but after manually setting up on D-link's website, everything work great
[t] Overall - Very good wireless router
##This is the second D-Link DIR-655 Extreme Wireless Router I purchased
##The one purchased last fall stopped working a couple of weeks ago
##(Could have been a lightning surge
##) I called support and all I can say is "what a joke
##" You can return the unit w/ a credit card number -- so if the problem is your fault, you'll be sent a new unit and charged $150
##(A power surge isn't covered under their warranty
##) Or, you can return the unit, wait for their evaluation, and then have them decide whether it's covered under warranty, make a fix, and return item to you
##(Could take weeks
##) Bottom line -- it's a lot cheaper just to buy a new unit from Amazon w/ free shipping
##The new router works faster than the old and has wireless coverage of over 100 feet
##When a storm is headed our way, I now unplug the unit
##(Nothing else was damaged the night the prior router went dead
price[@]##) The router can't be beat for the price & features
price[@]##However, if I have to purchase another one eight months from now -- my feelings about price may change
[t] MADNESS
##This is the worst, it worked for a month and then boom! the wireless stops, then the lan, and after that it doesn't even want to function, total garbage
##maybe I just got a bad one though
##but honestly
##for my home
##I'll stick to Cisco Routers
[t] SecureSpot Advertised Feature Does Not Exist
##DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ADVANCED SECURITY FEATURES!!!This generally seems to be an above average wireless router/firewall
##Two big issues though
##1) I bought this product for the SecureSpot feature and found out only after a very long, frustrating discussion with a less-than willing Customer Help Desk that SecureSpot is not yet available on the Rev B Hardware, and DLink has no idea when it will be added to the firmware
##Unfortunately there is no way to know if your hardware is Rev A or Rev B until you take it out of the box
##You will not find this information on DLink's website
##2) DLink's Customer Service seems to be in the business of regurgitating information that is published in the manual or on-line
##Anything unexepected (like missing feature sets) confuses them
##After the obviously off-shore Help Desk operator eventually figured out that SecureSpot was not available on my router he attempted to disengage by telling me that I should have been more careful in selecting the router (I used DLink's on-line configuration guide), but he was unable to point me to the web page that provided the necessary information
##Only after escalating did I find a supervisor who could offer some options (return the box)
##Without the advertised value added features, this is just an above average router with lousy customer support from a company whose marketing department is a couple of years ahead of its engineering department
[t] Tech support suck!
##The setup following the instructions that came within the CD never worked
##The personnel in tech support need support
##Yea, it suck! The phone communication with them is awful; in addition it is quite obvious they are not well prepared to deal with this matter
##After going in circles for 1 hour, the tech support just gave up saying that probably my computer was too old (in reality my pc is just 2 years old)
##I ended putting back my old linksys router
##Please, stay away from D-link
[t] very poor range, in my house
##After using this for a couple of months, I can only say I wish I had not wasted my money
##The range is not half of what my 5 year old Netgear was
##I can sit a room away, and it will say Very Low signal
##Update
[t] Share Port doesn't work
##I bought this router for one reason only, be able to print without connecting the printer to my computer
port[@]##Unfortunately, share port is VERY buggy
##Before buying this product make sure to google about Share Port
[t] Great Router So Far
##Have had the router for about 3 weeks now, and so far, so good
##Its replacing an old Belkin model (the thing was only a 'G' router, but it was at least 5-6 years old)
price[@]##It worked OK, but the laptop has N capability, the price was good on the D-Link, so why not?Set-up was actually kind of a pain, and the manual wasn't really much help either
##Not sure what was going on, but the laptop was detecting the network, I was trying to connect, but it just wouldn't happen
##After a couple reboots of both laptop and router, it finally caught
##Since then, everything's been great
##Speed is usually in the 3
##5-8 Mbps range, which is great, as the old router never hit higher than 4
##Connection strength is awesome
##Have yet to lose the signal!Range is quite a bit better than the old router
##The old router wouldn't even reach the other end of the house (about 40 feet and 4 walls away), let alone the basement
##With the DLink, I get 3 bars at the other end of the house and 2-3 in the basement
##Can even take the laptop outside and enjoy 2 to 3 bars, with no major loss of speed!Have yet to use the shared USB port, but may try it for the printer soon
##Will update if I do
##All-in-all, the router is living up to expectations!
[t] This router works, but it's not a magic bullet.
##I needed a router with gigabit wired ethernet and figured that wireless would be a good idea as well
##It's easy to set-up
internet[@]##It also has a nice "guest" password so that visitors who bring their laptops and want access to your wireless internet connection do not get access to your whole network
##The 802
##11N seems a bit better than my 802
##11G was, but I still have issues with wireless coverage
antennas[@]##The antennas are detachable, so I may be able to put on some directional antennas to increase my range
##I'm not unhappy with my purchase, but it didn't exceed my expectations either
##No surprises, so I guess that's a good thing
[t] FD
##Purchased the D-link DIR-655 router in Feb
##09 Replacing a Linksys routerI haave had since 05
##I am rating the D-Link with 4-stars only because of the set up problems I had
##Performace on the D-link is rated 5-Stars by me
##It has been working perfectly (since getting setup) and is very fast with no drop outs
##The linksy I had would keep popping up the (your wireless connection is now made)on the screen driving me nuts
##Then you had to keep going there with the mouse and X-ing out
##I am not real computer literate but can manage to use for what I need
##I would recommend the D-link DIR-655 To anyone purchasing a new wireless router
##To explain my setup problems, I spent about 3 hours on the phone to get it working But on the good side I was able to contact D-link and they took the time and people needed to get my unit working
##FD
[t] D-LINK WIRELESS ROUTER
##I OWN THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER A YEAR NOW I SET IT UP AND I HAVEN'T TOUCH IT SINCE
##GREAT ROUTER
[t] Good Router!!
##I have had absolutely no issues with this router
##Did a lot of research on Wireless N routers, and most folks gave this a thumbs up
##I have joined the ranks
##Can't go wrong with D-Link and this router
[t] Good to go!
##I was looking to get out of the house, and now I can get half way down the block
internet[@],speed[@]##The speed is great also, I play mmorpg and the only time I get lag is when I'm running other internet programs
[t] Setup Easy, Features Plenty
##The setup wizard provided on CD was fool-proof and worked without a hitch, for both my wired and wireless connections
##Even myArchos 605 Portable Media Playerconnected over the secure WI-FI
[t] DIR-655
##As good as it gets
##None better in quality, support & ease of use
##Stable!
[t] Sweet on my Mac/PC network
##Installed this router using my PowerMac for set up
##Simple, easy, quick
##I get excellent reception throughout the house and have not dropped the signal even once since I installed it several months ago
##We have 3 Macs and a PC connected and it works flawlessly
##Love it!
[t] D-Link Router
##Great product, worked very well out of the box
##Setup was easy and quick
##Increased my wireless range by more than double
##Would purchase it again
[t] good Router
software[@][u]##This is a good router,with tons of options in the  if you are inclined to messing with your settings
##Ive done minimal changes and this router worker great
##I do a lot of online gaming with Warhammer and this router takes the load with no disconnects or slowdowns
##I had a better linksys router before this and was always getting diconnected while gaming ,,,not with this D Link though,It also connects much faster with my laptop upon turning it on
antennas[@][u]##I did discover that signal strength is affected by the 3 antenna positions,i tried with the router sitting flat and got a 55% signal strength with my PS3,but upon standing the unit up and the  positioned as shown in the manual the signals strength went up to 85%
##I only gave it 4 stars because I thought the range would be much farther,,I have a 2 story house and the router is in the basement and it does reach the whole house,but i thought it would reach to my garage about a 100 yards away
##All in All very satisfied
[t] D-Link Router
##After installing this router I was very impressed and we still are
##My only complaint is
##it doesn't seem to work as fast as when we first installed the unit
##Other than that I would recommend this to friends and family
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##1
##Good range2
##Fast speed3
##Easy setup4
##Price average
[t] Works Great with a 4 Wireless Mac's. NO on PC's
##The macs work great
##The PC's I cant not log on at all
##Tech support suggested all my pcs need network adapter updates
##Tech support picked up the phone fast, but did not solve my problem
##I can not get on with a PC 3 different models
##But I can get on to my neighbors unprotected Netgear wireless router
##I guess I'll be at Best Buy in the morning returning this box
##Tried everything the told me it's all my PC's
[t] Quantum leap in speed
##My old ethernet network was unbelievably slow
##Although I was using a Netgear wireless router, I could not get a strong enough signal, so I was using a wired configuration connected through the router and a couple of ethernet hubs
speed[@]##This didn't deliver anywhere near the speed promised by my ISP
##I replaced my old router with the D-Link DIR-655
speed[@]##I got a really strong signal, and also got the speed I was expecting! But other connections thru my secondary hubs were not performing as well
##So then I got a new D-Link hub of matching speed, and now my entire network is performing at levels I never saw before
speed[@]##I learned an important lesson; that all the hardware needs to be fully capable of handling the speed available
##So, I recommend that your entire network be reviewed for compatibility
software[@][u]##The D-Link DIR-655 is easy to physically install, but the  configuration did require some help from my ISP in order to get it all straight
##Fortunately, my ISP does provide pretty good technical support
##(Of course, they don't have a clue about Macs
software[@]##) Once I completed the software setup, I must say the router has performed flawlessly
##I enthusiastically recommend the D-Link DIR-655 and the D-Link hub as well
##I am well satisfied
[t] Like night and day...
##I switched to D-Link products several years ago
##My last router was aDI-624 Wireless G
##It was a good router
##I live in an older home-- average size-- with plaster walls and the range was never what I had hoped it would be
##The DIR-655 is excellent! Not only does it reach every room in the house but to all four corners of our 3/4 acre lot with all bars showing
speed[@]##It is faster than my 10mbps high speed broadband connection so who knows how fast this thing can go
##I tried my laptop while browsing, downloaded files on the two desktops and put my sons Wii on-line and we all had solid, fast transfers and downloads
##As with my other D-Link, setup is a no brainer
##Pop in the CD, follow the instructions and your communicating in fifteen to twenty minutes max
##I'll stick with D-Link for my routers and this one is a honey!
[t] Great Router, pain in the arse to setup
price[@]##Good price for a gigabit wireless N router
##Wireless signal is strong and clear in my apartment
price[@]##Competitive price
##Gigabit means that if you have computers on a network in your home tethered via ethernet cable to the router, you can transfer files between them at very fast speeds
##10x more than previous generation routers with 100mpbs speeds
##I upgraded from a wireless-g router, which never really worked that well
##Signal would drop, fade, cut out every few minutes
##Very annoying
internet[@]##Wireless internet has finally come into its own with Wireless-N
##There are still moments when you'll loose a signal for a second, but they are few and far between
speed[@]##And importantly, the speed difference between my laptop, which is wireless, and my desktop, which is plugged right into the router, is slight
installation[@]##The installation help CD was DEFECTIVE
##Yes, defective
##I called D-link and they said they'd had a lot of problems with the install CD not working
##However, they do have 24/7 customer service who are quite helpful
##In the end it was a hassle but the router works very well
##All in all, if you want a router you can configure and then not have to worry about, this is it
port[@][u]##The one disappointment I had, which I suppose I could chalk up to me not doing enough research, is that I assumed I could attach a USB hard drive to the usb  in this router
port[@]##That is not the case, the port is useless except for some kind of configuration tools that are beyond me
##Would have been great if you could easily hook up a usb drive a la Airport for backups, as many households have multiple computers
##But alas
##if you don't need that function this router is fine
[t] D-Link DIR 655
##I was told by a friend to not skimp on router capacity or features, or I'd be sorry
price[@][u]##This is a good router with great capability at a good 
##I'm certainly not sorry I bought it, and it works great
[t] No Problems
##I have had this router for about 2 weeks now and I am very pleased with it
##The set-up wasn't quite as helpful as I would have liked, but with a little patience, it set up after about 30 minutes
##Have not lost a signal once and get coverage all over the house and even out to the back patio
##Highly reccomend this router!!
[t] Great with New, Bad with Old
##I've got a fairly decent sized network with wired PCs, Consoles, NAS, and wireless laptops
internet[@]##I was able to connect immediately to the internet through AT&T DSL despite other reviewers' problems
##Mine worked out of the box
##It took a while to go through all the settings, but setup was fairly easy
##The only real problem I have now is that the wireless for the laptops (only
##11b right now- I haven't gotten new adapters) is worse with this new router versus the one built into the DSL Modem
##The signal is weaker and constantly drops even though it's in the same place as the old router
##So, I enabled B&G on the old router, and N on the new one for when I get a new adapter or laptop
##The consoles have wireless G, but I prefer to hardwire them to stream from the NAS, so I'm not sure if anyone will have problems with G
##Overall, a decent device- Gig Ethernet is great and there's plenty of features; just disappointed with the wireless B
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##This device is simple to install and works great
##If the Install CD does not work, the instructions are simple to follow
##A great value
[t] Works great so far
##Have my Wii and linux laptop working against it easily
##So far the range appears to be much better than my older bg WAP
[t] D-Link DIR 655
speed[@]##This router, although a "draft n", has decent speed and range
##I gave it 4 stars since it was marginally difficult to configure
##There are two ways to set it up
##a provided CD or by accessing their web site
##I have seen from other reviews that their web site is the better choice
##In any event, I eventually had to contact D-Link for assistance
##They established the connection, but the person giving the technical assistance, although competent, did not know what customer service is about, since he did not have a clue as to the proper way to communicate with customers
##During our telephone call, he was talking very low volume and was very difficult to hear him
##I asked him if he could turn up the volume or speak a little louder
##he said there is no way to do that! It would be wrong to label all their support as this way, so it is probable that this may not happen to you
##So far, I've had the router for approximately one month, it has operated exceptionally well
[t] Amazing Wireless Router
##I first tried the DIR-625 coupled with the D-Link DWA-142
##That worked fine, but the DIR-625 had issues with my laptop, which was running a B/G wireless adapter
##So I upgraded to the DIR-655 and couldn't be happier
##Setup is very easy
##It works amazing with the USB adapter (the 142)--I have two of those now
##With Vista, I had to go online to get updated drivers, but other than that it was pain free
##This is a very impressive wireless-N router
##I suggest opting for this model if you are on the fence with buying the cheaper D-Link wireless N routers
[t] no drops!
##with two laptops, a network printer, and a networked external hard drive, we needed a router upgrade
##This wasnt as simple to set up as it claimed, but once it got going, its been great
##NO DROPS!!
[t] I've had problems with this router, but the speed and features are nice
speed[@]##I've had the most problems with this router over any other one I've owned (and I've owned a lot of them), but it's available features and speed is nice
##As far as I've read, it's one of the most reliable Wireless N routers out there, but is plagued with issues - most of which I hope will be fixed in upcoming firmware releases by D-Link
##Just be aware that if you get this router and have bandwidth issues, make sure to check your QoS settings - traffic shaping, uplink speed, WISH, etc - I've turned all these off and the router seems to work best that way
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Exteme N Wireless Router
##This has been a very good router
##It was easy to install and get running without MAC address control or encryption
##However, the interface to change these settings is different from my last 802
security[@]##11G router, and I have not yet been able to enable these security settings
##This router does seem to stay up more than my 802
##11G router
[t] Great features, fast connections but unstable firmware.
##This feature has a solid build, *fast* connection but it is not very stable
##Mine with firmware 1
##05, restarts at least once a day, drops and reconnects the DSL connection multiple times a day
##Hopefully later versions of the firmware will make it more stable
[t] major improvement
##significant improvement to range, user interface, and tech support
##yes tech support
##ROUTERthe range of this rounter is considerably greater than my old DIW-524
##the user interface is laid out very logically and thus is very easy to navigate
##TECH SUPPORTD-link's tech support was very knowledgable, patient, and helpful
##wish i could say the same for CenturyTel's DSL Tech Support
[t] Great router
##i replaced a linksys router that continually dropped off line and showed weak reception
##the D-link has never dropped off and has great distance and signal strength
##much better performance than linksys
##simple to set up also
[t] Works well, good compatibility... not sure about color scheme
##I have this hooked up to my cable modem with a VOIP box (Linksys SPA-2102) and three routers behind it (DGL-4100 gaming router, 2 Airlink Mimo XR AR-525ws)
##It seems reliable and the VOIP box worked well behind it for both incoming and outgoing calls
##It handles P2P traffic well, unlike the Linksys SPA-2102, which rebooted itself frequently under Azureus traffic when I had it in front of the DIR-655 as the primary cable router
##Wirelessly it works well with my old 802
##11g Airlink Mimo XR USB adapter at 54mbps, using WPA2-PSK, AES, without SSID broadcast
##I don't have a wireless N adapter to try with it yet though
##The management UI looks like an improved version of the DGL-4100; thankfully they dropped the useless Flash header
##It's as simple or as powerful as you want it to be
##I was able to set up static DHCP leases and put the DGL-4100 in the DMZ without any difficulty
##Cosmetically, the white casing is a change; would go well for people with Ipods or Macs, it sort of clashes with my other black and grey gear though
##The blue lights on this are an improvement over the ones on the DGL-4100, which would blind you if the were pointed at you; these have plastic over them so they're a little better
##I prefer the blue to the usual dull green LEDs though
port[@]##There's USB port on this, I think it's for some sort of automatic wireless setup but I haven't used it or looked in the manual to see what it's really for
##All in all, a good product
##I was thinking about waiting for the DIR-855, which will be dual band (2
##4 and 5
##8ghz), but on reflection decided to use the 2
##4ghz for networking and the 5
##8ghz for phones as I do now
[t] Received two DIR-655 DOA
##I ordered the DIR-655 based on the positive reviews it received on Amazon
##I have received two units from Amazon and both have been dead on arrival
##I spent about 20 minutes on each unit working with D-Link tech support
##I found it interesting that the two technicians tried totally different solutions
##Regardless, they could not get a TCPIP Ping to work so they declared my units defective
##This was my first and last D-Link purchase
##Back to Linksys
[t] Welcome to firmware hell..
##After using Linksys routers for many years, I thought why not try someone new
##So I bought the DLink DIR-655 in Sept of 2009
##This thing has been nothing but trouble
##Maybe we are just demanding wireless users, but the DIR-655 crashes daily
##I have tried at least three firmware updates and still crashes
##I have heard good things about DLink in the past, but I would avoid the DIR-655 at all costs
[t] Not Good
##Ran into numerous problems1
speed[@]##) Internet speed was 1/22
##) Could not manually configure the DHCP IP address3
##) At automatic kept losing the connection4
##) The Wireless connection was fast range was good
[t] SHAREPORT UTILITY S*CKS!!!!
##Trying to connect a USB hard drive to the DIR-655 for sharing with my MacBook running Leopard has been one of the most frustrating home computing experiences ever
##D-LINK HAS to know about this problem - it's all over the message boards and forums, and the problems have existed for awhile, but no one from D-Link is stepping up to tell customers when/if a fix will be made available
##If one doesn't appear soon, I'll be returning my DIR-655 and buying a Netgear wireless router
[t] Lived up to ratings
##I did a lot of research before buying this router
##I read dozens of reviews
internet[@][u]##Since installing this router I have had zero dropped  connections
speed[@]##The speed is great
speed[@]##I would and am recommending this router especially in use with a comcast high speed cable modem
##I would like to address one reviewer's experience with the router getting very hot
##His review was the only one I read that had this problem and it gave me a bit of concern
##The only thing I can think of that may have caused this is that the router comes encased in a thin plastic film, it states in the directions to remove this prior to use to avoid possible overheating
##The router is cool to the touch at room temperature
##Overall this router delivers what it says it will do
[t] Excellent replacement for my non-functioning Linksys
##I previously had a Linksys wireless router which took a lot of work to set up, but which worked fine for 18+ months
software[@]##Apparently CISCO bought Linksys and then changed the software
software[@]##Mine stopped working and the first call to Linksys they offered a one-time software fix for $29
##95 and one year of support for $39
##95
##I felt that it was a form of robbery, but agreed to the $39
##95 at which point the connection was severed on their end(the Phillipine's where their support was located)
##My second call resulted in a similar conversation only that upon agreeing to the $39
##95 "fix" I was told that their computers were "down" and to call back in a week
##I decided that Linksys was not worth the effort
##After looking around and comparing prices, features and customer reviews I settled on getting a D Link wireless router
##It arrived promptly, took only a few minutes to set up and, so far, has worked flawlessly
##I will never again buy either/or a Linksys or CISCO product
[t] Broke after 10 months!
##It quit working after I had it for 10 months
##Customer service an tech support is awful
##Couldn't understand them
##They refused to replace it
##Horrible experience
##Router was slow and didn't have good coverage, not even enough to go to the next room
##Don't buy it, get NetGear
##I'm now out 100
##00 because of D-LInk, I don't give it a D, I give it an F!!!
[t] Disappointed
internet[@]##Drops internet connection every few days, requiring a hard reboot
##Other than that, it's great!
[t] Fast, Easy to setup, and reliable
##good and fast router with a pretty good range
##I recommended this to a friend who is having a problem with the wireless network range because of the size of the house
##This router covers pretty much the whole house compare to the older linksys G router
##I help him setup and it was really easy to and fast
##All the dead sopt in the house was eliminated
speed[@]##The N speed is pretty amazing
[t] UPDATE - Died within 15 months
##4/25/11 - The router died on me this week
##I won't keep a connection going longer than 24 hours
##At first I thought it was Comcast but after plugging my PC directly into my modem I'm running fine
##It was a great router but I cannot recommend it due to the short life it has
##This is a great higher end router for the money
##My cable provider goes down occasionally and my old router(s) didn't recover very well and needed a reboot twice a month
##this router hasn't had any problems and has been online without a reboot for 4 months now
security[@]##The security features are easy to set up and i have a guest zone for my friends' iphones when they come over
##the only downside is that the range is less than my old G router
##but i live in a small urban house so the shorter range doesn't cause me any problems
[t] Great Router
##I bought this router because my old router was acting up a bit and I figure if I ever do get an N card this will be perfect
##So far I have had almost no problems with the router and I am even getting a better signal over a longer distance
##The only problem I have had is when I try to print from my laptop
##It can take up to 60 seconds for the document to print which can be frustrating at times
##Other than that I would highly recommended this product
[t] It works, but...
##I recently purchased a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router and several D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapters together
##The DIR-655 installed without a hitch and works well with several Linksys wireless G adapters I have
##It also works with the DWA-130s but not nearly as well as I had expected
speed[@],port[@]##The biggest disappointment is that although the DWA-130s reports that they are attached to the router at 130 MBPS, the effective transfer speed to the network-attached storage box that's plugged into an Ethernet port on the DIR-655 is somewhat slower than it was using the 56 MBPS wireless-G router and adapter that this setup replaces
[t] Excellent Router
port[@]##Great Router Excellent range Installed with D Link 8 and 5 port switches and a Netgear wireless Router used as a wireless access point
[t] Great Router!
##This router is worth every penny
##I have always had success with D-Link routers
##I purchased the DIR-655 to replace another D-Link wireless router that I used daily for almost 4 years before it unfortunately ceased to work correctly anymore
internet[@][u],speed[@]##I have not had any issues with this router and I am able to wirelessly link multiple computers and other devices like a Sony PSP with great  surfing speed
internet[@],speed[@]##I only wish my cable modem and internet provider could broadcast at a higher rate of speed (100 Mbps)because it is clear that this router could handle it
##I highly recommend this product to anyone
[t] Works Great!
##It was a little difficult to set up but once I get everything installed and hooked up correctly it works perfectly
speed[@]##Blows wireless b away in speed and connection times
##I haven't had to reset it since I bought it to renew IP addresses which was also a problem with my last router
[t] D-Link DIR-655 is a great simple router for wired and wireless connections
##This router is easy to set up and works perfectly
##I'm not familar with computer related issues but this router is pretty simple to set up and once your up and running it gives you very little if ant problems
##I use both wired and wireless connections and they both work great, good signal strength, works great with wireless X Box 360
##Paid $99 which is a great deal for this router
[t] THE BEST ROUTER. SO CHEAP. SO FEATURE PACKED!
##this is used in a house with 5 macs and 1 pc
##supports gigabit ethernet which is a MUST feature
##use this also with xbox and A READYNAS DUO DEVICE
internet[@][u]##our  is Verizon FiOS
##this router is the best router i have ever owned

##best router
##EVEN CHEAPER NOW
##edit
[t] great router for N wireless
##This is my fourth wireless router since 2002 and by far the best
speed[@]##It works great with excellent speed and range for the wireless piece; I have not had a chance to test the gigabit ethernet wired component yet
##Configuring it is best accomplished via the web interface manually
##so it maybe too much for newbies
##That said, I heartily reccomend it
[t] No Issues!!! Fantastic Router!!!
##This is a fantastic router! I tried another brand first and it was a disaster - dropped connections daily and lots of router reboots
##With this router everything just works
##No headaches! That's what I like
##This product works great! Just follow the instructions on the cd and you will be up and running
##However, if you wish to switch to secure mode and are not tech savvy, you may need assistance from D-Link tech support or someone else to configure that part
##I didn't have any issues but others may be a little overwhelmed with all the settings
##Hey, it's a fully configurable router so lots of settings should be expected
##Overall I would buy this thing again! Great job D-Link!
[t] An Extremely Nice Extreme N Wireless Router
##I purchased the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router to replace a Netgear Rangemax Wireless G router that died after 13 months
software[@][u],installation[@]##Thanks to its excellent  installation program and documentation, I found the D-Link relatively easy to install and configure for operation with a Comcast cable modem
##The wireless N signal is considerably stronger throughout my house than the Netgear G signal, making it possible to work on a laptop computer in any room
[t] Worked intermittently
##Was hoping that buying a refubished router would be ok but was totally wrong
##First we had to reset the router to factory settings to even get it working
##Then when it was set up it dropped the signal several times a day
##I returned this one and bought a Lyksys Cisco router that works great and very reliable
##I wouldn't suggest wasting your time
##Very irritated
[t] Wireless signal drops out
##Worked great 1st few days
##After that, the wireless signal would drop out and not even broadcast the ssid
##had to re-boot router
##Happened 3 days in a row
##Returning for refund
##Seems like these routers are a hit or miss if you get a good one or not
[t] overrated
##distance for the router is not as published, the public needs routers with the distance that export routers have, we need stronger transmission and pickup areas for these routers, sure looks like it would work with all the antennas, my home is frame home with hardi siding, will not penetrate the walls to outside, junk
[t] Long Time Dlink User Disappointed
##I had the DIR-655 earlier model and it worked fantastic until my neighbor's house got struck with lightning
##Ruined my DIR-655!!!OK, I said, just go to Amazon and buy another one
##What a big mistake that was! This B1 version dlink DIR 655 router is the pits
##Wireless?
##Where???? I got a WDTVLive box and never had a problem with the earlier version but this one won't even let it connect without screwing up all the other network connections
##I guess I'll move on to another brand
##Anyone got any suggestions for reliable wireless routers?
[t] NOT WHAT ITS CRACKED UP TO BE
##Horrible Barely worked at all and range? what range? wish I never bought it
[t] D-Link 655-- Great product
##I bought a NetGear router a couple on months ago
##It was supposed to be top of the line
##I never could get it to work properly
internet[@]##It would work fine for a day or two and then lose connection with the internet
##I must have run the setup DVD a hundred times and could not get it connected again
##It was no good at all
##I bought to D-Link 655 and it took about two minutes to set up and has worked like a charm ever since
##I would recommend it very highly
##Unless you want a lot of grief do not buy NetGear routers
[t] PERFECTO!
##ESTOY MUY CONFORME CON EL ROUTER, PUDE CONECTAR MI COMPUTADORA DE ESCRITORIO Y ADEMAS MI LAPTOP EN RED, ASI TENGO ACCESO A LA IMPRESORA COMPARTIDA SIN CONECTAR NINGUN CABLE
##LO UNICO QUE RECOMENDARIA ARREGLAR ES EL BRILLO DE LAS LUCES (LED) QUE MOLESTA SOBRETODO DE NOCHE
[t] experience
##es un buen producto lo recomiendo, es de facil intalacion, siempre que sigas los pasos como te indican en el cd de instalacion
installation[@]##is a good product I recommend, is easily intalacion, if you follow the steps as outlined in the installation cd
[t] Easy instructions
installation[@]##The router has an easy installation and it works great
security[@][u]##I have my TV connected to my wireless network with wpa 
[t] Great Little Router
##I read most of the reviews and checked out others before I bought this one
##It is everything people had reviewed this to be
##Very satisfied
##I did buy the square trade extended warranty just in case
[t] Works great for me
##While I may not be an expert in home networking, this unit seems to be doing everything I would expect from a router, from being secure to being fast
##The unit has always worked as I want it to and has so many options as to make the most technical user happy
##For the average home user like me, the default setting seem to be everything I would need
##About the only thing I don't like is the brightness of the LED lights on the front of the unit
##I just wish there was a way to tone them down a bit, actually quite a bit
[t] It's Ok
##Loved it when I first got it than started having random issues
##Wireless is fine, QoS doesn't seem to work one way or the other
speed[@][u]##Had DNS issues, issues with Roku and issues with  (Comcast ISP)
##Ok, for most basic users and also have slower Internet, would recommend something else; though this might work as a good AP only
[t] Great router
##This is my second D-Link router, the first one (wireless-G) worked flawlessly for over 2 years
##Bought this model to upgrade to wireless-N
software[@]##The setup was easy, be sure to disable any firewall software on your computer that can block certain ports
##I have 2 computers connected directly to the router via Wi-Fi, plus a Wi-Fi enabled iPod touch, plus a Wi-Fi enabled Blu-Ray player
##I also have a D-Link wireless bridge/access point device connected to the router and two more computers connected to that device via Ethernet along with two VoIP adapters
##And it all works without a hitch!This is a good, solid product
[t] Very pleased with this selection!
##I wanted to install a wireless router but not being a computer geek was a little hesitant
##This particular one was recommended to me by a family member so I ordered it
installation[@]##The installation was a snap! The CD that comes with it takes you step by step through the installation
##It has been providing reliable service since install doing everything I had hoped for!
[t] Boiled Eggs
##The radius of service is exactly as described, and was up and running in 25 minutes by me, a wire-less virgin
##I called Tech support because my HP printer would not stay connected, D-Link helped me resolve the printer's issue within 30 minutes
##Very professional support, even if the quality of the phone line was very poor
speed[@]##I have two laptops, an HP printer, a kindle and the wii, all using working with little to no speed problems
[t] N+ D-Link router
##This router is N+ (not to be confused with the dual band)
##It works great with the new 3
##0 modems and offers 10/100/1000
##This is a very easy to setup and use product
##Very reliable and dependable
speed[@]##With WiFi use on laptops using N speed 130
##00mbs, linked with cable to a 1000 LAN connection 1
speed[@]##0Gbs is displayed and the download speed is excellent
streaming[@][u]##Either wireless or cabled watching  videos is outstanding
[t] Password access to software malfunction
software[@]##The set up and usefulness of this product is greatly impeded by the fact that it locks you out of the status and configuration software once you do the initial setup
##I factory reset the divice twice and still was not able to get in by the default password
##I have or have had Linksys, Netgear, and Motorola devices on my system with no problems of this kind
##Apparently (after two useless email tech supports and one trying but kind and helpful phone tek sup) the Windows Internet Explorer browser (8
##0
##6001
##) 32 bit combined with Norton 360 4
##0 is incompatible with this device
##After a few min
##of talk and silent waiting the phone teky had me open a different browser and in like Flynn, repeatedly
##I wanted to get this improved review in before the initial one burned too long so I still have to discover range, UBD port, and others
##I was concerned becuse the CD instructions said on some page late in the book of over 100 pgs that the problem I was having could be due to my having been issued a European model and it would not be correctable in the USA
##That wasn't the case apparently
##If you have same problem getting locked out try opening a different browser and punching in your 192

##The browser D-Limk had me use which worked w/ Norton 360 is Foxfire
internet[@]##One of the things email support gave to do (didn't work for me and not given in CD instructions) was clear the browser's temp internet and cookies history
[t] Best install experience
##I have installed multiple wireless routers and this is by far the easiest of all of them to install
##The Windows setup is straight forward and does not require you to plug items in at only certain times, or cycle power after setup
software[@]##I consider these all bandaids for unfinished product software
installation[@]##I highly recommend this unit for home installation solutions
[t] Used to be very good
##It was my second identical unit
##But I had to return it because for an unknown reason, it dropped my connection from time to time
##When it happened, I had to spend hours to get it connected again
##I knew it was not my ISP's issue because I could connect my computer directly to the modern and browsed the web
##But when I reconnect the router to the modern, the indicator light might indicate the connection was ok (green, the setup page also indicated proper connection with ip assigned) but I couldn't browse the web, or the indicator might indicate the connection was not ok(yellow)and stayed that way no matter how many power cycles I did on the modern and the router
##Today, I wasted 6 hours and I had enough of it
##In addition, the setup GUI was very annoying
##It flashed every time I made changes (it is not ajax, I guess) and it took forever to respond to the change (very slow CPU)
##Finally I went get a NETGEAR RangeMax Wireless-N300 Gigabit Router with USB WNR3500L
##In 10 minutes, it was done
##Much easier! I believe that the 4 stars rating for this Dlink was from the past model
##The newer construction is no longer that impressive
[t] Great Buy
##This product has exceeded my expectations
##It increased my bandwidth from 12mbps to 16mbps and decreased my latency from 200ms to 26ms (On a 9 year old router, haven't hooked up the new one yet)
##It was also extremely easy to set up
[t] Awesome Speed
##This router is great
speed[@]##The Gigabit wired speed is a nice upgrade from other routers in it's class
##This makes a nice addition for my home LAN
speed[@]##The N spec wireless performance is awesome for signal stength, speed and distance
[t] Wireless ready to go
##Right out of the box, folowing the inclosed instructins it was up and working
##There are many options in set up that I dont understand but it's working very well with the basics
##Good buy
[t] Just awful
##D Link has the worst customer support you will ever experience
##The product does not get along with my WLAN provider and very frustrating experience even trying to get my computer back up and running after it crashed it
[t] The WORST investment I have made for my network to date.
##I think that Dlink has hired people to write positive reviews for this thing, because it is a joke
##Let me say, I have a $30 Linksys routerLinksys BEFW11S4 Wireless-B Cable/DSL Routerthat I have replaced with this one
##I moved into the basement, 3 floors from the computer upstairs, and thought that the Linksys would not reach
internet[@]##I was wrong, the Linksys reached fine, however, we had already ordered this router, its talks of faster internet and safety sold me on it, I thought it may be worth replacing the old router, which I had bought in 2004 I believe
internet[@]##Upon recieving this router, I installed it, and immediately, my internet was slowed down by at least 5x of what it was
internet[@],software[@]##It made my system crash, because of this software it came with, and my internet would disconnect CONSTANTLY
##I called Dlink technical support, which has been a joke! I spent 3 days talking to these people
##30 minutes to get to a technician, just to have them insult your intelligence and tell you to reboot the router and the computer, and call them back if you have any more problems
##No matter how many times I told these people I have done that, and that there is a problem, they keep telling me that as if it will magically fix things
##It doesn't, obviously
##Finally, I got some semblance of good advice before being hung up on, adjusting a number on my router's advanced settings, that stopped the constant DCing, however my computer was still running like a turtle carrying a refridgerator on its back
internet[@]##I rolled back my system to the day I recieved the router before I installed anything, now my internet is fine
##However, I am hard wired into the router
##the computer upstairs, say that it is out of range of the router
##I had to bring it all the way down stairs, and it still said it was out of range!upon turning encryption WAY DOWN it finally said that it was connected, yay, sort of
##Unable to use WPA encryption? how is that SAFER then the $30 router I had previously? its really not
##However about 1 minute after I got it to connect, it promptly lost signal, even being NEXT to the router
##Absolutely useless
##Even though it had a full 5 bars, it cannot connect
##its not the network cards fault, this computer was connected wireless from 3 stories up with the $30 Linksys, mind you, and cannot with a $120 peice of garbage
##Finally, someone from Dlink, upon my billionth call, tells me that there is a chance that you cannot encrypt with Dell computers, (the upstairs computer is a Dell) notice how, no where on ANYTHING about this router, does it tell you that
##I also purchased the network card that acompanies this router, the same model and what not
##I installed it, and my computer doesn't see it, or see it exists
##I cannot install the drivers, as it doesn't detect the new hardware
##I STRONGLY advise anyone thinking of purchasing this, think again, or at least, just take the money and throw it down the toilet you will be doing the same thing, just saving yourself money on phone calls to Dlink and from ripping your own hair out from frustration
[t] Fits well in my garbage can.
##Nice features, decent performance for what we use it for
##All for not, after 6 months it drops all wi-fi connections after a few hours of running old firmware or latest
##After reading reviews here and there
##trying out a Belkin wireless N router
##If that can't stay up more then a week at a time after 6m of use, I guess I'll dust off my old WRT-54G
[t] A great router for the ULTIMATE 1991 Internet Experience!
##I have to say, I'm floored
internet[@]##This router perfectly emulates the experience of browsing the internet in the early 90's
speed[@]##The only thing missing is that beautiful dial up sound! The speed, however, is spot on! When the computer is plugged directly into the cable modem I own, the speed is WAYYYYY too fast
##15 ms pings with 20 Mbs download
##Once I go through the D-Link DIR 655, either through wireless or a wired connection, the speeds drop to reasonable levels! Pings are over 200ms like they were meant to be
##Download speeds sometimes drop to about 100kbs! That's still faster than dial up modem speeds, but what can you do
software[@]##Even better, the software is bulletproof
##I've played with every conceivable setting, nothing can change the speed! Hats off to D-Link for delivering a router that delivers 1991 speeds in 2012 for just under 100 bucks
[t] Need a lot of Techinical support
##I constantly called D-Link to solve my problems
internet[@]##Tech support was easy to get to and the helped me get my computers connected to the internet
software[@]##Using the share link software with my windows 7 crashed my computer
software[@],port[@]##I plug in my printer into it's USB port on the back of the unit and needed to install the software for it to work
##My printer would only print part of the page
##Called tech support and they had me change some settings and my computer crashed for the first time ever
software[@]##I tried unistalling the software and it will not
##I gave up and hooked the printer back to my computer and it works fine there
[t] Waste product
##I order this router 2 weeks back
##Easy to setup but problem started after 3rd day
##No signal so i have to reset again
##Then after 2 days again wifi stopped working
##Called Dlink Support and helpdesk guy was helpfull and again he reseted the router
##But again after 3 days it stopped working
##Now returning back this router and ordering LinkSys WRT 400N
[t] No gain over older "g" router.
streaming[@][u]##Bought this N router to replace an older D-Link G router to improve coverage/speed (as advertised) so I could reliably watch  video from Netflix
##Coverage/speed was no better, actually worse than the old G router
##Returned for refund
##Thank you Amazon for hassle free return policy
##No thanks D-Link for misleading advertising, at least in my situation
[t] Do not buy this. Please look elsewhere
##This worked for a while
##Then all its settings 'locked up'
##I could not modify MAC addresses, change encryption or anything
##I had my admin name / pass, and the admin panel confirmed all changes, but 1 minute later everything would revert
##The router was bricked and had to be thrown away
##$100 for 6 months work
[t] very pleased with this router
##No complaints after one month use
software[@]##During set up my virus protectioon, McAfee, would not allow the product software to be viewed as it said it posed a threat
##I did not need it however, as my Samsung Blu-ray DVD receiver led me through the set up process without a hitch
streaming[@]##I've been streaming Netflix flawlessly
[t] Garbage and if you do waste your money hope u don't need Tech Support
##This router was a problem from the word go
##Right off the bat I needed to call tech support because I kept getting errors while trying to set it up, being told I need to reset the router
##So I call Tech Support after an hour trying to find some sort of helpful info on D-Link's website with no luck, then end up with the most incompetent person in the world
##It took over a half hour for this person to take my info constantly having to repeat myself on almost every other word
##After that headache I ended up having to get put on hold for 10 min because I needed to get a supervisor to help me seeing after I told my Tech "Specialist" 3 times that I keep getting an error message and am unable to connect my computer to the router, she Insisted that she ask if I am able to connect my computer to the router all 3 times
##Oh and just to get them to understand that I did not want to talk to them anymore was another project of its own
##So finally I get someone that can help me connect and now my desktop is connected
##I then go to connect my laptop and have nothing but issues that was another 2 hour project
##So finally I get everything working now it is time to set up my HomeGroup both comps using windows7 already had then set up on previous router should be piece of cake yet its nothing but problems
##I would get my code put it into the other comp they would see each other for about 2-5 min then I would get an error that the other comp is not on or connected
##Never had this problem with 2 previous routers contacted tech support and had another incompetent person and gave up now returning the router
##Also my network printer alwasy ends up going offline and it wont let me print I have to delete reinstal it just about every other time I print
streaming[@]##Also the range on this router is crap I use to be able to go and mow my lawn while walking around w/ my droid connected wirelessly streaming music from Pandora with no problems now with this router I can not make it half as far as the 5 year old D-Link I had previously before the music cuts out to buffer
software[@],port[@][u]##One last thing the USB  on this thing for adding a external drive to be uses some stupid software that doesn't allow me to access it on 2 comps at the same time which makes no sense to me if I can access my laptop and desktop's hard drive at the same time on one comp why is this any different
##I highly recommend to steer clear of this router
[t] D-Link DIR-655 wireless Router Review
##I bough this router from Amazon
##com and it arrived with free shipping which was nice
##It replaced my old Netgear router due to the intermittent connection and having to reset it about 5 times a day
##This D-Link router was very easy to set up and you just follow the on line instructions on the CD that is provided
##At first I had the router not communication with the Internet and all I did was hit the reset button on the router and a connection was made
##So far this router is working fine and I am running Windows Vista
##Signal strength is pretty good as I have not lost signal yet in my small home
price[@][u]##For the  I would give it 5 STARS and have no complaints
##For all the people who wrote negative things about this router probably did not set it up correctly and the set up was different from my Netgear
##Just install and read the CD and follow along and you should be fine
##If all is hooked up okay and still no signal, just press the reset button on the router and all will be working
##The initial loading set up may take a while but be patient and don't hit the cancel or unplug etc
security[@]##There you can set easily your security WEP or WPA code
##Great router and it is working so far so good!
[t] Little outdated
##Let me explain my situation first
internet[@]##I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and am using a satellite internet connection
##That being said, I found this unit on Amazon on sale for $75
##Most of the reviews were positive, but there were some negatives
##The most common negative is the setup and the lack of tech support
##I didn't realize how old the reviews were
##This unit is still running Draft-N
##If you don't know what that is (like I didn't), it's the early version of wireless-N
##The connection was spotty, but it's a great looking unit
##The instructions were hard to understand and setup was impossible
##The instructions gave really simple directions on how to get the cables ready for the wizard to set it up automatically, but it would keep giving me errors
##Of course tech support was nowhere to be found
##I'm quite sure somebody with technical sense could set it up, but it shouldn't be like that
[t] Works well in my dorm
##Bought this unit over the summer to give myself wireless in my dorm room (although it was probably unnecessary haha)
##It was so easy to set up, even with no experience working with routers before
security[@][u]##I don't have any detailed  settings running, but the wireless lets me use my HP Officejet 6500 without being plugged into it
##This makes printing from anywhere and scanning very easy without having to keep plugging in and out from the printer
##The only con was that my friend that works at Cisco wasn't too happy I bought a D-Link product!!
[t] I own 2 and both are solid
##I bought one about two years ago and needed a second router so I bought the same one
##Both work great and have never had any problems
[t] My first wireless router
##Installation was easy
##This is the first wireless router I've had due to an expanding home network
##This router has been reliable and very fast
##Some of the speeds increased 3-4 times on some computers
##I've only had to reboot my modem once since installing this a couple months ago which used to be needed once or twice per week with my old wired router
##It runs warm, but not hot
##Cons
[t] Works great and easy to set up
##This router was easy to set up
##I am by no means good with electronics and I managed to hook it up entirely by myself
##I have it on the second floor and by husbands computer picks it up just fine in the basement
##Able to stream movies via Netflix wirelessly to our xBox with no problems
##Price here was cheaper than in any stores
[t] Defective But I love Amazon
##Lightening fast shipping, as usual
##I love Amazon
price[@][u]##Great  and free shipping
##I love Amazon
##Easy return for defective router
##I love Amazon
##Wireless didn't work right out of the box
##For 10 Mps, got 3 Mps max
##Wired got 10 Mps
##D-Link tech support was fast to answer when I called twice
##They were very thorough and courteous
##Determined it was defective and assured me that if Amazon didn't take care of me they would send me a replacement
##Though I knew Amazon would come through
##Did I say that I love Amazon
##It's not physical
##Really, it's not!
[t] You pay DLINK to return defective item
##Got this item today
##After hours with DLINK tech support they told me it was a defective item and to send it back for a replacement
##When I went to get an RMA number they told me I have to pay return shipping
##I sent it to Amazon for a refund with no charge for shipping
##DLINK stinks
[t] Heating issue
##Works like advertised
internet[@]##Worked for a few months then I noticed it kept dropping the signal and internet use
##I noticed that it over heats then stops working
##I pointed a fan to it and it seems to work
##The worst router yet
##Security features is the only thing I like from it
[t] great wireless router
##easy setup, great reception around the house
##researched around extensively and glad i went with this as it was a breeze to setup and is blazing fast
[t] Dlink 655 n. is fast
##Fast shipping on this advanced N standard router
##Better than the other brand i used for years
[t] Fantastic! Worth every penny.
##This router rocks
##I get way better range and way faster downloads with this router compared to my old Linksys Wireless-G that got fried by lightning
##And I'm not even using the wireless-n yet
##can't wait to see how fast it is with that! The setup is incredibly easy
##A poorly trained monkey could do it in 20 minutes, tops
##This router costs a bit more than some others out there, but it's for good reason
##One reviewer wrote that his router got too hot and began to experience lag when the router overheated, but he must have had a faulty unit--I have had no sign of overheating after many months of use
##The blue lights are a tad bright, but it's not a bad looking router overall
##Kinda reminds me of EVA from Wall-E
[t] Easiest Router to set up. Longer distance than Linksys
##There is a reason this is one of the highest reviewed wireless routers on Amazon
##It has to be the easiest set up i have experienced
##i plugged it in and it worked
security[@]##The security options are substantial, including robust parental controls
##My only issue is that i have to reset it quite often
##Probably once or twice a month
##That said, i haven't seen any consumer priced wireless routers do a better job
speed[@]##The range is better than my Linksys, and surprisingly, the speed is better as well
##I highly recommend this router
##D-link made a pretty good product
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Wireless Router
##Easy to install and put into operation
##I owned a D-Link DI-524 Wireless Router which I used for about six years before I upgraded to a System 7-based desktop PC
##The 524 is a very reliable and sturdy router, but it was much more complex to install than the DIR-655
antennas[@]##I found that I needed to position the wireless adapter in conjunction with placement of the antennas on the DIR 655 router in order to maximize the signal strength at the receiving PC end
##With a little patience this can be done and excellent performance will result
##Very good router! I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to others
[t] Works great
##I'm so glad my old g D-Link finally died
##The old router had to be reset multiple times a day and it was impossible to download large files wirelessly
##This thing works great
##Set up was almost too easy--this spoon-feeds you every step
##I download audio books from my library in minutes
##Have had it over a month and have only reset it once
##Looks nice, small, lights are blue
##Worth every penny
[t] Great router.
speed[@]##This router was so easy to set up - using it for main computer, secondary upstairs and a netbook and all have great connectivity and speed
[t] Happy Customer
##We are very happy with this product
##We have 3 laptops anda desk top computer and a play station 3 in our home
##Our oldrouter could not handle all
##We have had no problems sincepurchasing this router
##I would recommend
[t] A nice, solid router
##This is a very decent router
##Having no experience with wireless routers, I based my buying decision on reviews from here and other websites
##This router had better reviews than other similar routers, and, therefore, went for it
installation[@]##The installation was not hard at all
##Just pop the included setup disc into the drive and follow the directions
##In no time, my wireless network was set up
##I haven't gone through the advanced stuff yet, that is, using the firmware
##However, I'm already satisfied with the basic setup
##So far, I have a desktop with Windows 7, a desktop with Windows XP, a netbook with XP, a Wii, and a Lexmark X6650 wireless printer all connected to the network and everything is working great
speed[@]##I'm getting decent speed
##The Windows 7 computer is connected to the router, and the others are connected wirelessly
##The other desktop is connected with a DWA-130 USB adapter and is getting between 1-3 bars, yet it still performs well
##I haven't used customer service yet
installation[@]##But, since the installation was so easy, I haven't run into any problems yet
##I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to start a wireless network at home
[t] Difficult to work....
##Got it in the mail and set it up right away
##Followed the instructions
##Had it working for about 10 minutes, and then it just stopped
##2 days of trying to fix it
##Nothing worked
##Had others helping me too
##Router would not reset for some reason, and I kept getting error messages when I tried to reinstall
##Went and bought the exact same router at local store for a bit more money
##This one works
##Almost
##wireless laptop works, and one of my wired computers works
##Which is great
##But my third computer, which connect at first, stopped all of a sudden
##Still trying to fix that
[t] Great router
##I saw some mixed reviews on the router but overall they were positive
##There may have been a problem with some firmware updates in the past
##As soon as I set it up I upgraded to the latest firmware and it has worked without a hitch
##I have not needed to reboot since the firmware update
##It has been up since the day it arrived
port[@]##I don't know about the USB port since I don't use it
##I run a web server and a domain server the firewall only allows the ports I want open
##The static IP feature comes in handy as you can prevent dhcp from switching your I

##address
##Very happy with the router
[t] HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. CUSTOMER SERVICE, GREAT PRODUCT.
##I started out knowing only a little about routers but after a couple of weeks of (intense)learning felt confident in making a selection
##We decided on a D Link router since it seemed that the D Links were more compatable with Comcast cable, our provider, than the Linksys routers were
##Or at least there were more compatibility complaints with the Linksys in the reviews
##And to find the specific router, I went to the D-Link site and used their product selector
streaming[@]##My key issues were compatibility, signal strength, video streaming suitability, and getting the most for my money
##When the product arrived, it only took about 1/2 hour to get it set up on two computers - no tech service calls required
##We've been using it for about a month and are extremely pleased by the performance
speed[@]##The only time the HD video is a little quirky is when Comcast is busy, and the broadband speed drops
##But non-HD is still fine
##But that's a Comcast, not a router, issue
price[@]##My one disapointment? The day the router arrived, Amazon had lowered the price from what I'd paid
##UPDATE
[t] Works Great!
##This wireless network router worked right out of the box
##Painless setup! It works great for my PC laptop, my roommate's PC netbook, my other roommates Apple iMac, my Xbox 360, my Roku player
##Simply could not be better
##I love it!!
[t] Difficult installation
##Difficult to install initially using the CD-ROM provided but worked well after I ditched the CD-ROM and figured out how to directly access the router's web interface
##Seems I had to reboot the router pretty much every time I changed any settings because router would get hung up trying to connect to the DSL modem
installation[@][u]##Has worked flawlessly since 
##Consistent signal strength, stronger the 5 year old NetGear 80211 a/b/g router it replaced
[t] Excellent upgrade from the D-Link DGL-4300
##I was hesitant at first, because I had become very attached to my trusty D-Link DGL-4300 108G Gaming Router and I was concerned that this newer model would not be much of an upgrade
speed[@]##I was very pleased to find that not only was the router incredibly easy to install, but it made a very significant improvement to my speed online, including online gaming
##It also eliminated connection issues that I had been experiencing whilst uploading to Flickr
##My home network flows a lot faster too and I get a more instant response from my PS3 when I navigate streamed content from my main PC, that acts as my media server
##This router does also have a Gigabit WAN, so there's ample future-proofing there!Overall, I am delighted with this new model, but I have not bothered with the Wireless or USB features
security[@]##I am still concerned about health issues with Wireless devices and also security
##I am also not particularly interested in the USB feature as I had read that it was flawed in many ways, and I just do not have time to mess around with something that isn't solidly built
##Apart from that, this is a first class router and has made my Internet connection run much faster!
[t] Great router/firewall
##Hands down the best wireless router I've ever purchased
##Has great firewall features, including the ability to block entire ip address ranges
##I would have preferred more flexibility in defining the ranges, but definitely far better than most consumer routers
streaming[@]##Have not had any issues with the wireless range, works very well streaming HD content to xbox
##The setup utility is well designed and professional
##Extremely reliable, other routers I've purchased in the past require a reset at least once every 1-2 weeks
##This router has been running strong for over a month without a reset
##D-Link really outdid themselves on this router
[t] Works great but I wish the GUI was more user friendly
##I've only had it for a few months but so far so great
##Great speeds, no drops
##Not the easiest router to setup but its not as hard as some people in here make it seem
##I wish the web GUI was more user friendly as far as being able to find where certain features are
##Its another example of a gadget that has sooooooo many features and the the user interface is just hard to find where things are located
##Once you do find it its fairly easy though
[t] Dissapointed with range
##Product works fine, has a lot of features and connection time is stable and reliable
software[@],port[@]##The range of the signal isnt better than the old Cisco G router its replacing, the other issue I had is the Usb port to which I connected an Epson printer, the software and usability its just rubish
##Other than that the router works very well but it isnt extraordinary
[t] Excellent signal strength
##I don't know about the negative reviews on this
##I've been completely happy
##Had it for a few months now after recommendation from friend who works in IT
##Great strength of signal throughout house
##No heat issues that others have complained about
##Big improvement over the wireless modem that Time Warner provided
[t] fast but dropping signals all the time
##Setting up the router was a breeze
speed[@]##I also realized an increased range and a much higher wireless speed compared to my Linksys WRT54GX
##What really bugged me was how often I lost my connection, wireless and plugged in with a network cable
##I tried to tweak the setting and resetting the router but to no effect
##I switched back to my WRT54GX
##It is a bit slower but it is totally stable
##I am not able to debug my entire neighborhood and see if anything interferes with the DIR-655
##It shouldn't have affected the plugged-in connection
##I wasted a lot of time debugging and am done with this product
[t] Not an improvement if you don't need the N
##I purchased this router from Costco, hoping to improve the range and signal over my 2 year old Netgear super G, which occasionally needs rebooting
##The setup is not as easy as it should be, required some playing around for the network setting
##The signal strength is surprisingmuch weaker than my old super G, with frequent dropping of the connections on all 3 HP notebook running on G, as well as my Palm TX
##Unless you have the N setup for most of your wifi needs, I don't believe this router is any better than the regular $[
##] router
internet[@][u]##The Network magic is also quite invasive, especially if you download the program for the wireless computers, which supposely can send a report on the  history via email
##The Network magic often locks the computer upon startup
##Fortunately Costco has a good return policy
[t] A diamond in the rough
##I have been using this router for about the past 5 months and have not lost connectivity once
##I am a heavy user of bittorrent and I also use VPN to access my work through-which I transfer quite a lot of data
##I upgraded from a WRT-54G v3 (before linksys nerfed the router in v5), so that was thought to be a pretty decent router for the money, but I am more impressed with the reliability and features of this one
port[@]##I am not using the QoS features, but I am using dynamic dns, static IP and port forwarding
##This router has been working flawlessly
##The reason I wrote this review is because I realized the other day that it's been months and I haven't had one router problem, so I figured people should know
[t] Excellent router!
##This is an excellent router with lots of features
##Great speed, great range, but you do need to use a Wireless N card (I'm using D-Link DWA-652) to take full advantage of this
##Reception is excellent throughout the house, with no noticeable dead spots (there were several with my old router), and I can now even get online outside on our deck
##The router pretty much works out of the box
##It took me all of five minutes to be up and running
##It has lots of tweaking features, but I haven't tried most of them yet
##I like the automatic e-mail notifications for firmware updates
[t] No Router Better
##I've been through all of the brands and many models
##I have stuck with D-Link
##Now, I will never even look at the competition
##The Extreme N is by far the best wireless router I've used
##It's easy to set up and easy to use advanced features
##The wireless is the best
##It not only has a better range than the others, it's the best constant streamed connection I've had
speed[@]##Even through 2 walls and a ceiling, I can get full reception of this thing at full speed
##I don't have the N card, I'm just using 11g
speed[@]##The speed is great and I can't argue with the uninterrupted signal
##I haven't had a single drop-out
##Unlike Netgear
##The LAN connection is everything you need
##1000Mbps speed, and one of the few routers that use it
##It's hard to find a gig LAN router, which is odd since most machines include gig LAN built in
##Even on a 50ft cable I have absolutely no signal loss
##The advanced options of this thing are so easy to set up and work right away
##This thing accepts changes to its NAT on the fly
##Most routers take some time to fix their tables, this thing does it on the button press
##For the price, the Extreme N gives you tons of options and it has the fastest speed, making it the best router buy available I think
##Not only is it a router but the new firmware makes it capable of switching to a bridge
##Giving you even more options
##It's more expensive then some other wireless routers, but well worth it
[t] Quick Router Setup Wizard Did Not Work
##I have been using a D-Link DI-624 AirPlus Extreme G wireless router for several years, but I now have a new computer and am using Windows Vista Ultimate so I wanted to upgrade to the latest wireless technology
##The DIR-655 is a good-looking unit in a white case with flashing blue LEDs
software[@]##The instructions for setting it up were easy to follow; however, the Quick Router Setup Wizard software did not work for me
##I could not connect to the Internet even though my NIC was hooked up to the DIR-655 correctly and the router to my cable modem
##I called D-Link tech support and a technician worked with me for almost two hours before passing me on to the second level technician
##Neither one had me use the setup wizard
##The second tech determined that my computer was trying to connect through another gateway rather than through the D-Link gateway
##When he gave me the workaround for this, the router finally connected to the Internet and it has been working as it should ever since
##The unit provides more signal strength to the other two computers in the house than did the DI-624, and even though it didn't work for me, the setup wizard appears to be easy to follow
##Setting up WPA encryption was very easy
[t] the best home/office router available!
##This router works great with my Cable connection
security[@]##The security within in is excellent and the range is pretty acceptable tho I really recommend also use wireless-N adapters to gain its full strength
##Overall a great and competitive product
[t] shoudl be better for the price, and tech support isn't great
##I just bought my router yesterday
##It has some issues which I'm still trying to work out
##I have 2 laptops and a desktop
##The desktop works fine as it's not wireless, but I have been having issues with my signal dropping on the laptops, and another issue with weak signal strength
##I have 2 or 3 bars of signal strength on one of my laptops, despite being about 5 feet away from the router
##And strangely enough, the laptop with the g-wireless card has better signal strength than the laptop with the n-card
##Another strange thing is, apparently the router comes with several default settings that aren't ideal for connecting wirelessly, which seems stupid
##And I mean really obscure settings that even someone who is fairly tech savvy, as I am, would not know to do
##I've set up quite a few wireless networks without many problems, but these are settings I have no clue what they mean and would never think to change them (or even know how)
##Tech support must have had me change 15 different random settings that I could not have done without guidance
##I still have NO CLUE which of these settings actually made any difference though
##So it seems fairly likely you will need to speak with tech support
##They're apparently open 24/7, which is nice, and wait times weren't too bad (although I did call at 10pm) but just a heads up, their tech support department is shipped to India (like most companies now days), and they're EXTREMELY difficult to understand
##And the level 1 tech support staff isn't very knowledgeable
##Unfortunately you need to speak to them before they'll forward you on to level 2 support
##I did have some better luck with them, but still had some communication issues
##It appears that my connection is no longer dropping, but I still have a weak signal when I'm right next to the router
##As for the laptop that IS receiving full signal, I wasn't actually too impressed when I walked around my house checking signal strength in the various rooms
##Though, i guess it's possible that it's my house causing that
##Who knows
##It might prove to be a good router once I get it working properly, but I would expect more from a router that cost me almost $100
[t] Sadly, Did not Work
##From all I hear, this is a very good product
##However, I could not get it to work on my system
##I wish I could give it a good report
##My attempts to get it to work corrupted my system so badly that I had to reformat my hard drive
##Rather than struggle with foreign product support, I just returned it
##I am not a computer illiterate, so I am disappointed that it did not work
[t] Constantly drops wireless connection
##After only a few weeks this router's wireless stopped working
##After rebooting or power cycling the device the wirelss might start working for 5-15 minutes then stop again
##It is not signal strength because I am 4-6 feet from the device
##D-link support was absolutely no help
##I mentioned to a colleague at work and he had the same router and same problem
##He threw it away and bought another one from a different manufacturer
##I will be doing the same when I can afford it
##For now I am tethered to the wire
##This is the 3rd product from d-link that I have had unsatisfactory results from
##Never again - third strike and d-link is out
[t] I got a lemon
##I bought this item based on the many positive reviews here on Amazon
##My only concern with this item is that there is a review saying it runs very hot, which is not a problem with the one I got
##It is cool when running
##My problem is that the unit I got only worked well for a day or two
internet[@]##Then for no reason my internet connection is intermittent
##I was able to isolate the cause to this router since if I connect the modem to my computer, there is no connection problem at all
##I called DLink customer service, after an hour of changing settings without being able to make the unit work, they told me to return the unit to Amazon
##What a disappointment and waste of time and money! This model might as well be really good
##But I certainly got a lemon!
[t] I'm happy
##I received this only 2 days ago but it works extremely well, easy to set up (once I followed the disk simple instructions)
##My belkin was consistently disconnecting my new laptop for no apparent reason, this on the other hand is much faster with no disconnects unwanted as of yet
##Also I fired off 3 comps
##at approx
##the same time they all connected
##So far so good
[t] Ok
##Works as advertised, WiFi reception is very good, my net book gets a solid connection from ranges my 2 year old router, wouldn't even be visible from
port[@]##Had some slight issues with port forwarding, does not seem to handle a lot of customs settings very well
[t] Long time D-Link fan
##I've been a fan of D-Link equipment for a long time
##And this router does not disappoint
##It works perfectly for what it's meant to do
##The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they do try to make it do too much
##Home routers, even for the tech savvy, really don't need a lot of options in the admin interface
installation[@]##They try to compensate by providing the installation wizard but many of the options could simply be eliminated as many of them are just other ways of setting firewall rules which you should only really play with if you know what you're doing in the first place
[t] Excellent Router
##I bought this router 14 months ago after much research and have been extremely pleased with it
##Compared to the previous router we had (a different manufacturer), it has not failed once in all that time, or required a restart
##The device was very easy to install and set up, and there are way more features that allow a lot more flexibility compared to others I've used
##I ended up buying a second one for one of our kids to use, and it's worked very well for them also
##I highly recommend this router
[t] Good router
##This router was not easy to install and had to ask assistance from a friend who did have to contact tech support but managed to get it up and working and is doing great now
##Love this router and had pretty blue lights
[t] Works great but too brightly lit
##I've had this router for over a year now
##It works great - my only complaint is the ridiculously bright blue lights that show connectivity
##They are so bright and are always flashing - don't put this router in a bedroom because you won't sleep
##It'll feel like you've installed a large blinking neon sign next to you
##I've had to turn the router around because the lights can be so distracting
##D-Link should have done smaller or at least dimmer lights
internet[@],speed[@]##I rarely lose connectivity to the internet with this router - it only happens once every blue moon, so I'm very happy with the speed and overall connectivity
##I do live in a small home, though, so this router hasn't been tested with my laptop more than 3-4 smallish rooms away from the router
[t] Could be better
##I have quite an extensive home network with around 30 LAN devices and 5 WLAN devices
##Router is easily configurable but requires a reboot after all setting changes
##This is crazy
port[@]##It adds exponential time to add configurations such a virtual servers or port forwarding due to the constant 60 second reboot cycle
[t] Works great, fast, easy setup, large
##Works great, fast speeds, easy setup
antennas[@][u]##My only complaint would be the size of it - it is very large, especially with the  out
##I knew that going into this purchase, as I would imagine most people would if they look at the photos ;)
[t] Good home or small business router
##I'm a repeat buyer of D-Link routers
##PRO
[t] Dir 655
##Althoght this seamed like a good router and I did get more distance than my old one
##It was purchased for my sons online gaming
##There was to much lagging on the game play
##And al-though tech support tried to help it was to little to late
##I did return the product
##Just wasn't the right fit for our needs
[t] Solid for casual consumers
##This router would of received more stars in my book if I actually was able to keep it
##Unfortunately I had to return it, but not because it's not a solid router
##The main and only reason I had to return it is because it cannot sustain my VPN connection
##It drops my VPN connection if I idle for 4 minutes and even the latest firmware (1
##32NA) does not fix it
##Don't buy this router if you need to VPN into work!Other than that, the router was solid and have plenty of features
##Some options in the web interface may be a bit confusing to look at
[t] Works like a charm
##I was so impressed I bought a D-Link modem too
##The router works as advertised
##I'd recommend it to a friend, a good friend
[t] D- Link 655 Extreme N Wireless Router Review
##After having our three year old G router system start to work erratically my wife and I thought it was time to switch over to a more reliable system
##After looking through the reviews we chose the D Link 655 and are pleased with our decision
##First off it has not dropped any logged-in sessions as was the case with the Linksys g model
speed[@]##It is quicker( not by the advertised amount) adding at least 25% more download speed and the reception on my computer buried many rooms away from the router has improved from "very low" to "good"
##I expected "very good" reception based on the literature but can't really complain knowing what I had before
security[@]##The router setup is a breeze and the security feature is outstanding
##No problems whatsoever
##So far it is living up to its billing
[t] Great buy
##Most reviews here are spot on
##The one reviewer who had a router that overheated must have got a lemon or just plain forgotten to remove the plastic covering on the air vents! The only thing I wish this product had was VPN capability (some other comparable products have it)
##I am very impressed with this product and I am sure it will satisfy most people's needs
speed[@]##The wireless speed increase was the best part of my upgrade
##I went from
##b to
##n so it was probably even more so
[t] Died after just a few months
installation[@]##I didn't have too many installation issues, but this thing just died after a few months
##I held the reset button for minutes and it wouldn't reset
##I won't be buying D-Link products in the future, I expect alot more out of something I paid $100 for
[t] great refurbished!!
##I got it refurbed
##no problems
##I had to call customer support to get my Xbox 360 set up for Live, they walked me thru it no problems
##I get good reception all thru the house
##I give it an A+ for now, only had a month
[t] Very unreliable.
##I have to continuously reset this router so that my wired devices will be recognized by my wireless laptop
##My $40 NetGear wireless router never had a problem; this thing is grossly overpriced for the quality & reliability
[t] D-link 655
##Good wireless router - setup was a easy and the wireless seems to work ok
##It could use more range though
[t] Great product
##This is a great wireless router
##I have a laptop, PS3, Wii and an XBOX connected to this, and they all work fine- fast and has a great range (both basement and upstairs)
##Would recommend this to anyone
[t] UNHAPPY
##Would not recommend to anyone
##Drops calls and constantly needs rebooting
##Pain in the neck!!!D-Link DIR-655 N+300 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless RouterD-Link Systems Wireless N 300 Gigabit Router (DIR-651)
[t] Just ok
##Same as the old one I replaceded it with I have to reset it one or two time a week
[t] Piece of crap
##The signal was never as strong as promised and now, less than eight months after purchasing it, it is completely dead and I can't return it because the return policy is 30 days
##It is a PIECE OF CRAP and I will not buy D-Link ever again
[t] Does not stay connected
internet[@]##I have tried everything to get this router to stop disconnecting from the internet
##It disconnects sometimes every five minutes! Returning!
[t] over priced and seemed designed to last just past the warranty
##The router seemed decent enough but just about after a year after purchase, it started to exhibit problems with signal strength and at the 14 month after purchase mark it stopped putting out a signal all together
##How convenient
##Way to go D-Link!
[t] Stopped working after a week, just like the other 400 negative reviews
##Not only is this rather irritating (but manageable) to configure, it straight up stopped working after a week
##If you parse the reviews you'll notice that 400 out of 1100 reviewers have given this product 1 star, so I assume they have the same issue
##Pretty crappy to think that almost FORTY PERCENT of users have a defective product
##Unbelievable
##Unfortunately the VOIP company (8x8) that my company uses says this D-Link is the one that works best with their phones, so I have to buy another one
##Therefore I'm getting it at Fry's where I can return it ad naseum
##If you have to have this modem, I would buy it from somewhere where returns are easy
[t] Great Router
price[@][u]##This Router was recommended to me by my computer guy and it is installed we have it on a network, the  was right and was shipped quickly to Hawaii
[t] Great product. Great value. Need more user-friendly design. Need better technical support.
##The product works great for simple setups like with a cable modem
##Fast connections and great range
##However, if you try to set it up with another router, such as Verizon FIOS Actiontec modem/router, you will have some issues and have to make configuration changes to get the maximum upload speeds
##I called the helpdesk, they were reasonably fast to take up my call, but they assumed I knew nothing about technical stuff and made me jump through hoops to change the configurations
##I was exhausted when I was transfered to the next level of support
##I am sure if I had continued with the instructions, I would have eventually made the proper configuration changes, but they need to train their staff to efficiently troubleshoot and make configuration changes
##For comparison, I also bought a Netgear N750 router
##They have a better and user-friendly product design
software[@][u]##Their  automatically detected the other router and automatically changed its ID address
##Much smoother install and configuration
[t] WORKS GREAT AND GREAT ON PRIOCE
##DOES EXACTLY WHAT I WAS HOPING
##SPLITS MY SIGNAL WELL AND I USE ABOUT 10 DEVICES IT SEEMS SO ITS NICE FOR THE SPEED
[t] Liked
installation[@]##D-Link DIR-655Product works great, haven't had to reset since installation
speed[@],streaming[@]##Increased download speed and multi use capability and including streaming
[t] very fast router
speed[@]##I was impressed with the speed of my computers after installing this router
internet[@],speed[@]##I previously had a Linksys router and had no idea that my internet download speed wasn't being fully enjoyed until the Linksys stop working and I had to purchase a new router
##We have both wireless and cable computers in our home and everyone has notice the difference
security[@]##The only trouble for me was understanding how to configure all the security features on this router
##So I've only set up the router according to the instruction on the install CD
[t] Dlink DIR 655
##Exellent router , very stable and a lot of options to play with
##Wireless better then 802g but most of the time the router will not use 802n for various resons mainly compatibility with other network adapters
price[@]##in any ase a very good product I would recommend to others although maybe it better to wait a price drop to 70-85$
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##This product is fast and works great
##I gave it to my dad and little bro as a xmas present and they love it
##My bro can play clean xbox halo online and my dad can surf the net quickly without disruption
[t] Strong signal, easy to install!!!
##This router has been nothing but positive for me
##Installation was simple and I did use the included Network Magic trial software, which is handy
##I have had a very strong connection throughout the entire house, though I only live in a one-level, so am not sure how the performance would be on a two-level
##I have a laptop, desktop, and a Wii connected without problems
##Price-wise, this is up there, but so far has been very good and very reliable
[t] Solid Connection
##I'm very pleased with the product
##It performs as hoped
##We are able to connect with a very strong signal at all times
##The set up went well also
[t] good router worth the price
price[@][u]##This is a good router and worth the  if you are looking to purchase one
##The product is constructed very nicely with many hardware features
antennas[@][u]##The hardware itself includes three detachable 2dbi  (less signal loss), vivid connection indicators, and several lan ports
security[@]##The included hardware features consists with support for wireless standards, security (wep and mac address filtering), and a moderately complex configuration interface
##Again, this is worth the purchase
[t] Finally
##A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++After giving up on all Linksys products for dead out the box and intermittent signal, in addition to their setup CD's being useless, what a relief to find a product that works fantastic and is a breeze to setup
##I am using XP SP2 and download and installed the lastest firmware from Dlink
##Dlink's website is great
##They have detailed instructions with text and pictures
##I set the router up manually because of my experience with Linksys and was up and running in 15 minutes
##This router is fast and I have yet to drop signal from anyware in my 2 story house
##I purchased the Xtreme N Wireless PCI Express card DWA-652 for the laptop and am running in wireless -n- only
##It's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders
##Doing work from home has never been free of frustration because of signal drops until this router
##Tell your friends and family to purchse this router and card combination and end drop signals for all wireless users
[t] Works very well, including w/ PS3 WiFi
##I had a difficult time finding a router that worked well with encryption enabled with all my computers and my Wii and PS3
security[@]##All are running flawlessly on this router with WPA2 security enabled
speed[@]##I have one wireless N device, and the speed I get with that laptop is excellent
##Overall I am very pleased with this router; it missed getting a fifth star because the setup wasn't as user-friendly as I would have liked, but that was more of a problem with the PS3 than with any other device
speed[@]##The speed and thoroughput I get with all the rest of my wireless devices, which are all wireless G, is also great
##The PS3, for example, is in the master bedroom, while the router is in the office on the complete opposite side of the house
##I have a 67% signal strength on the PS3 consistenly, and it works great
[t] Easy to Set-Up
##This router was very easy to set-up, and performs better than my Linksys
##So far I've been very happy with it
##The range is a bit better, and the signal strength is good as well
[t] DIR-655
##This is one of several wireless routers that I have tried
##I am extremely pleased with the performance of this router
##Easy setup and operation
##Some previous reviews commented that the router runs hot
##I have not experienced any problems with heat from this router
##It is an excellent product and I am very pleased with my purchase
[t] Fast connection, long range!
##I'm not a wireless guru
##So I don't know all the fancy terminology
##I do know that my past two wireless routers kept dropping out at random times
##Since they were my first two wireless routers, I thought it was just a normal aspect of being a wireless router user
##Well, it's not! This router has not dropped out at all and its range is amazing
##I can use the WiFi on my iPhone when I'm outside at our apartment's playground, which is at least 1000 feet away
##The router was easy to get set up and even had a wizard to help you through it, if you need it
##All in all, a great purchase
[t] Caution - Don't Buy
##After many weeks of struggling with this router, I am now trying to return it to Amazon, even though I am past the return date
##The first problem is that the connection (both wired and wireless) drops out for a few minutes on a regular basis
##This is particularly painful while watching a movie or playing a game on line
##The second problem is that our wireless printer doesn't work well with this router having an intermittent connection
##The DLink tech service is a huge pain being well trained in the run-a-round
##After countless hours, I finally discovered that this version (B) has a known hardware problem that has not been fixed
##I'm told the older version (A) is ok, but I'm not willing to chance it
##I'll try to return and have gone back to my old Linksys
[t] Alright... Some issues so far though...
##The 655 was chosen for it's decent reviews, gigabit ports, and wireless functionality
##However, so far I keep on having constant disconnects with my laptop and my cell phone regardless of usage
##The firmware is the latest 2
##0NA and the router is within 10 feet without obstruction to both devices
##Both disconnect at the same time, which means theres something wrong with the router rather than both devices at the same time
##Wired desktop works properly though
##The router itself doesn't crash, and the switch functions as it does, just the wireless part restarts
security[@]##Have tried changing various settings without success including N only, mixed modes, power settings, channels, security modes, etc
##May end up returning
##EDIT (1 month later)
[t] Great Value
speed[@]##Wanted an N router for the added security, extra speed and range
price[@][u]##Found this unit on special and couldn't beat the  for the feature set
##Setup would have been extremely easy except for one glitch in the easy setup routine
[t] Works great
##I bought this router to replace an old router that didn't have the coverage needed for my house
##This one works perfectly, covering my 6100 sq ft (on 3 levels so about 2000 sq ft per level)
internet[@]##My son has a game system which uses internet in the basement and said he has had no problems with this router slowing down or losing connection
price[@]##And after researching, this was the best price available from anywhere, fast shipping which was nice, easy to set up and get running
[t] Still a great choice for a mid-range router
##The DIR-655 replaced my old Linksys WRT54G
##I chose it after reading quite a few professional reviews and could not be more pleased
##My home is roughly 2300 sq ft and 2 stories (it also has a basement)
##This unit is actually wall mounted in a closet on my first floor (central to the house) and patched into a Gigabit switch in my basement, where all of my CAT5e runs terminate
##In this position, I have outstanding range throughout my home and network transfers between my desktop PC in the basement, my Windows laptop, my DNS-323 NAS and my MacBook Pro are quick
##Another reviewer mentioned heat as being a problem - I find that odd
##I have hardware revision 2 and mine runs as cool as could be (otherwise I wouldn't have wall-mounted it to drywall)
##The lights are a bit bright, but then, I don't see them (blue LEDs always have a tendency to be eye catching)
##This router is easy to configure, but has an incredible amount of depth and tweakability if you feel the need to
##Out of the box, it's rock solid stable
##Aside from having to reboot it to do a handful of firmware updates, this router has been absolutely rock solid
##Another comment I thought worth mentioning is that I use a Nintendo Wii and an iPod Touch with this thing (using WPA2/AES security) and haven't a single complaint
##I know many people have had trouble with both devices and secured wireless connections
##In short, I would recommend the DIR-655 to anyone looking for a single band wireless router
##It was my first D-Link product, and I can see myself purchasing many more
[t] D-Link Dir-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##Easy to setup, but just note; if your using a Comcast Router for both Digital Voice and Internet, you will most likely be required as was I to remove the internal battery on the Comcast router
##This was the only method to release the ISP static IP addresses,and to trigger the renew to the comcast router, and process to append the ISP IP addresses to the wireless router was able to complete
##Prior to this step, the Dlink Router couldn't append the ISP IP addresses
[t] Great Router-Easy Set Up-Very Solid
##Upgraded from Linksys G to use my Roku HD/XR Box
##Easy Set Up
##Admin options are more that you would ever need
##Set up WPA with no problems
##Great Coverage
##Even works better on G band than the Linksys
##Two Thumbs up
[t] Best Router Please Read
##I bought this router almost a year ago now and have not had any problems with it
##It's fast, no down time and don't have to restart it constantly
##BUT set up is not what I would call 'very easy'! If you're having trouble with the router ( as I have noticed some people writing the reviews are) don't send it back as most of the time it can be fixed
##My advice
[t] Don't upgrade to firmware 1.3x, it's a nightmare!!!!
##I had been very satisfied with my DIR 655 for 1 year, until I upgraded the firmware to 1
##32NA, when was the nightmare begins
##The router freezes/reboots every 5~10 hours when connected to my cable modem
##And takes 10~20 minutes to get connections back
##I don't like the firmware 1
##32NA at all
##I want to downgrade to 1
##21 which has been stable for one year
##Obviously there is no way for me to downgrade
##I believe the securityspot service (non-free service, try to monitor every connections) from the 1
##3x firmware hijacked/ruined the best router
##(Search the web for complains, someone should be fired if I am the boss)
##I gave 3-star to D-LINK for their horrible way to abuse firmware upgrading
[t] Great router
##This router is very easy to setup on a Windows XP computer, but the interface doesn't work with Safari, so I think D-Link needs to improve that
##It has a excelent signal strength and the draft N works great I have connected two Intel macs and my old 11b HP
[t] Finally a Router that Works
##I had many years ago a d-link router that had problems
##Since then I was using Edimax and Linksys (WRT54GS)
##The latter was crashing several times a day
##I replaced it with Dir-655 and since then no problems
[t] Great Range, Fast and Easy to Install
##This is my first review ever
##But I try to be very cautious when buying products
##I decided to purchase this product due to the many favorable reviews
internet[@]##However, I was concerned that the product would not have the range needed to use the internet all over my 3600 square foot home
##My network is a combination of wired and wireless and the unit needed to be placed in the far corner (not in the middle) of my home due to wiring constrants
##The reception has to pass through several walls and upstairs
speed[@]##I am very happy with the speed all over my home
speed[@]##Also there is a noticable speed increase with both the wired and wireless devices
speed[@]##My wiring is Cat5 so I wasn't sure if there would be a difference in speed in my application
##I use my computers for work and personal use and they are used all day long
##The router was easy to set up
##I have used two D-Link switches in conjuction with the router and all equipment is working faster and more reliably that before the new router was installed
##I was reluctant to make this change because even though my old router connection was up and down all the time it was working most of the time and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get the new unit up and running correctly
software[@],streaming[@][u]##It was a breeze to install, the software is easy to understand, the range is great, it is much faster than my old router, there is no longer pauses when  video, and I wish I had replaced the old units a long time ago
[t] Beware of Magic
security[@],speed[@]##I had G router and 2 adapters from D-Link which were fine, but wanted to have more speed and better security
##So I bought this and two N adapters to create a new network
software[@],installation[@]##The installation disks come with software from Network Magic which I decided to install to make the setup simpler
internet[@][u]##But the computers with the adapters just would not stay connected to the  and repeatedly had to have their connections repaired, rendering them virtually worthless
##Finally, my wife uninstalled Network Magic and went with the Microsoft utility instead
##Now everything works great
[t] Excellent - and it works with Vista
##First off, let me say that Vista sucks
internet[@]##I have jumped through hoop after hoop and multiple routers/upgrades/patches to try to resolve ongoing internet connectivity issues
##I was about to reformat my computer back to XP when someone suggested that this dLink router might solve my problems
##The first one I got didn't and I returned it, disappointed
##But, after reading all the glowing reviews, I gave it another shot
installation[@]##This time I got most of the way through the installation before I got stymied
##I called the DLink help desk and they were able to walk me through a firmware upgrade that did the trick
internet[@]##I'm happy to say that I have had 100% internet up time for the past two weeks that I've been hooked up
internet[@][u]##That's saying a lot after my  going down 20 and 30 times a day prior to this
[t] Intel Mac users beware!
##Intel Macs running the current version of Mac OS X (10
##4
##9) are incompatible with this router
##The configuration page does not render properly on any of my three Macs, regardless of whether they use a wired or wireless connection
##And with the latest AirPort firmware on the MacBook, the WPA settings cause a system crash (kernel panic)
##D-Link technical support was no help
##I sent them an email with a screen shot from Safari and Firefox, and they responded
[t] So Far so Good
##Purchased in 2013 so it is not the most current or the best product available
##Installation was relatively pain free
installation[@][u]##Better to follow the instructions in the booklet along with the  CD than to rely on the CD alone
##One step wrong and you will be back to square one
##Oddly, neither set of instructions discussed actually assembling the router (as in screw in attenae now etc)
##Not a significant barrier if you are familiar but coudl be confusing to a first timer
installation[@]##Completed installation in about 20 minutes from soup to nuts
##Able to connect ipad, 2 iphones, home PC, 2 work PCs and xbox at will
speed[@]##No diminished speed
##Comcast signal that runs between 65mbps and 140mbps did get a significant boost
speed[@]##times on speed tests were blazing fast aproaching 2
installation[@][u]##5 mbps? Compatible with Windows 8 for 
##No issues with logging in from anyother device
##VPN clients worked fine
##Haven't checked distance of signal yet, my previous cheap dlink used to be able to cover a 2 block radius from the house (which was a shock)
##It looks decent and it does the job
##I'll update review if any serious issues come up
[t] Major WIFI issues
##I bought this router when my dlink died
##I had nothing but great experiences with that one
##The DIR-655 has had nothing but problems
##It drops WIFI connections all the time across all different devices(laptops and phones) and and operation systems(Windows, linux and android)
##The devices usually connect within a minute or so but its extremely annoying
##Another problem I've noticed is issues balancing heavy WIFI and wired load
##Wired connections get a clear priority over wifi connections resulting in poor WIFI bandwidth
[t] Does not work after a year.
##Terrible quality
##Disconnects intermittently after the first few months
##Needs rebooting to get the router to work again
##It gets progressively worse
##Now it is non functional
##Do not buy
[t] Worked for a year
##This router worked great for about a year but now the Wifi radio seems to be going out
##This manifests as an inability to connect to the router through Wifi about twice a week
internet[@]##Unplugging it and plugging it back it resolves the issue but who wants to do that every time they use the internet
##It was expensive
price[@]##For this price it should last more than a year
##Also, its not compatible with DD-WRT
[t] Lots of features, total reliability
##This router replaced an aging Linksys WRT54G
##The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing, two wireless networks (one not connected to the LAN), and a really comprehensive settings menu
##I have owned this for over 6 months and have never had to reset it due to instability
##I would buy this again, and recommend it to others
[t] Just got it, up and running
##Replaced my DLINK DI634 with this
##10-20 seconds to acquire wells fargo account or amazon reduced to 1-2 seconds
speed[@]##Same greatly increased speed for msn and email
##also, communication between my two shop computers was almost unbelievable after the change
##SUGGESTION
[t] D-link
software[@][u]##The unit was easy to set up with the provided 
##I'm having problems portable items hookin up with it
##My two computers work great with
##The d-link seems to be having problems with inderstanding ite passwork connection
[t] D-Link DIR-665
##I have had the router for about 2 months
##Wireless signal is strong, but I have only tested it inside my small apartment
##Setup was routine, no sticking points for anyone who's done it before
port[@]##My desktop is wired into the ethernet port
##Fantastic speeds as expected
##Wireless N speeds are excellent, connecting laptop/smartphone/iPad was easy
##Reliability is inconsistent
##When a lot of torrent traffic is happening, web activity can slow to a crawl or be completely disabled
##It is unpredictable - sometimes it happens and other times everything works as normal
##The torrents themselves are never affected
##Aside from that it has been solid, no interruptions for routine use
##I tend to torrent only while sleeping so this rarely affects me
software[@],port[@][u]##I have not had time to test out common features like  forwarding, but the configuration software is robust
##Overall it has fulfilled my need of a fast home network, and completed my migration to 802
##11n
##For most users it should be more than adequate
##If you are a HEAVY torrent user, you may want to research the slowdown issue further, as it is common
[t] GREAT PRODUCT
installation[@]##Wired setup was easy using the installation guide
##Wireless was a bit more difficuly
##My laptop (XP) was setup without much difficulty
##My wife and son's netbooks (both XP) seemed to get stuck on "verifying identity" on the initial setup and again when reconnecting
security[@]##I removed the security key due to this frustration and made the network "invisible" so my neighbors would have a more difficult time sharing with me
speed[@]##Changing setups is very easy and speed is excellent for our uses (internet surfing)
##I do not have N cards on any of my computers, but I doubt it would make a great difference for our uses
##We are getting 31 Mbps (wired) and 15 Mbps (wireless) down and about 2 Mbps up
##My laptop is located at the other end of the house (about 40 feet and several walls) and have excellent reception
##Very happy after about 10 days of ownership
[t] Fantastic!
##This is a great little router
software[@][u]##Setup was a bit of a pain, took a couple run through of their  to get the necessary bits to cooperate in order for it to work, but I have a feeling that my roadrunner modem was being picky at the time as well
##A little bit disappointed in the range this router has without the antenna, the internal one is NOT powerful enough, I was down to maybe two bars just sitting in the next room of our apartment
##But installing the externals takes just a few seconds, and greatly increases the range
internet[@],security[@],price[@]##Happy with the security features as well, we noticed there were a few IPs binging on our internet before, and now there are none!Overall a fantastic little router for the price
[t] Defective product, defective support
##I kept having issues with my game consoles complaining about my NAT being set to strict and it was affecting online play and chat and support couldn't seem to help me out
##It just seemed that technology finally outran my poor old router
##It is very old (although I love it and it still works great otherwise)
##I ordered the D-Link DIR-655 since it seemed to have what I needed (and much more)
##I spent hours trying to get the router working properly
software[@]##The software meant to easily configure the device kept crashing on my computer so I gave up and configured the router manually
##I got it working in a few minutes while plugged directly to it, but had a problem authenticating wirelessly
##I called D-Link support and the agent helped get my laptop connected after some work on the router, but my game consoles would not work wirelessly
##I got off the phone with him figuring it was something needing to be changed on the consoles and it probably wasn't his problem
##Nothing I did worked
##I called back after making a change on the router that managed to block everything that wasn't plugged directly into it (my fault due to losing my patience)
##I spoke with D-Link support again and explained what was going on and the person I spoke with seemed very distracted and paused a lot, seeming to be looking something up each time, only to ask me what was happening when I was actually waiting on him to tell me what to do next
##I told him that the best thing might be to reset to factory settings and just configure it to see if I could get a connection again and work forward from there
##He said that I would be doing that by myself because they had a queue of customers with a 30 minute wait and he had to go and take care of them
##I won't type what I said to him (although I used no profanity)
##I hung up and called right back figuring I'd reset the router and sit in the queue waiting the 30 minutes for someone who might actually be willing to help me
##Someone answered in 2 minutes!(?) I then explained my displeasure with customer support and said that if the router wasn't working by the end of the day, I was sending it back and getting a Linksys
##He apologized for my previous experience and vowed to get me up and running
##He did just that! Including my game consoles
##It all seemed great
##Then a little while after I hung up, my son started getting dropped from his online games
##I checked it out and sure enough the connection was dropping every 15 to 30 minutes
##I got in touch with D-Link support yet again and they told me to call my ISP because it was on their end
##I explained that I had plugged directly into the cable modem and reconnected my old router and had no connection issues that way
##It only happened when using their router
##I was asked what H/W version my router was
##I told her it was version "b1"
##She then told me that there were known connection issues with that version
##So I said "Oh! It's defective?"
##She told me is was not defective
##It just had connection stability issues
##I asked her if she bought a car and every 15 to 30 minutes it swerved off of the road and turned off, would that be acceptable? And if she complained to the dealer and they said that it was not defective, but just had an issue with staying on the road, would she keep it? I think not
##I told her that I had a Linksys router for about 6 years and NEVER had this sort of issue with customer support
##I expect occasions where a device needs to be reset or routes lose their way, but a known issue that affects the core functionality of a device is a DEFECT
##I didn't even care to try to fix it anymore
##I was focused on this thing from about 11am until about 7pm with nothing but headaches
##I reconnected my 6 year old Linksys and got everyone back up and running in about 10 minutes and told my son to get over it if he couldn't hear all of his friends or join every game until I get a new router
price[@]##I returned the D-Link to Amazon and ordered the Linksys e2000 for about the same price
##Nothing is ever certain, but I'm confident that I will have an easier time with this one
[t] It's everything I wanted in an 11n wireless router
##I used to have an old Linksys 802
##11g wireless router
##I didn't know how slow it was
speed[@]##Recently I upgraded my Internet and didn't notice much of a speed boost
##Then I got this router
##WHOA
##I'm seeing 5-10x the speedup with the same exact Internet service
##I guess my old gateway was the choke point, and I never knew
##I did read the reviews here before purchasing
##I was concerned about the heat issue
##Well, I've had it running for 36 hours straight and it is running pretty much at room temperature
##Not a problem for me
##Another thing I hoped for was better range
##I needed to put this under my TV, in one remote corner of my place and I wanted to get coverage across the whole place
##I was hoping that 11n would deliver on the promises of better range
##Well, in a word
[t] Does not work with Verizon FIOS
##I was pretty cautious before buying this router because all of the 1 star reviews
##However, the product had a 4 star review overall and I've decided to give it a shot anyways
##I'm a pretty technical person (software engineer), and it took me over an hour to figure out how to get this working with my Verizon FIOS
##The problem is that it doesn't recognize the WAN connection coming out of my FIOS modem
port[@]##After tweaking, I found that the default mode on the WAN port (10/100/1000 auto) for some reasons does not work correctly
##I had to force it down to 10Mbps
##Even then, I was still getting horrible speeds that was 1/5 of what I was able to get with my 3 year old G router
##I'm returning this unit to Amazon for a NetGear instead
[t] DLink Router
##I ordered this router for myself but ended up buying another
##My brother n law needed one on his Hughes Satelite powered system so thats where it ended up
##Install was ok it wouldnt talk to the modem but Tech Support was lighting fast in answering and telling us what to do
##After that we were hooked up and running
##Seems to work great but time will always tell
[t] Worst Wi-Fi I have ever owned!
##I have to reset it every few days
##It was extremely difficult to set up (and I consider myself a pretty advanced computer user
##I work with computers for a living)
##I will never buy this brand again
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N " a definite winner "
##The DIR 655 Extreme N wireless router is extremely easy to set up and the performance is outstanding
##My house is quite large and the reception is excellent anywhere in the house
port[@]##The USB port is handy for wireless printing with any USB interfaced printer
##If your in the market for a wireless router you should really consider the D-link DIR 655 Extreme N router
[t] Broke
##Had mine for 6 months
##It is already broke and the connection is slow
##One of the white antenna's is flopping around, it will not screw on tightly again
##Oh well
##I guess I will have to buy the apple product
[t] works good
##after having to contact customer support to solve a connection problem, apparently only WAP works with Windows XP, it's been working great
##of course the range is not far enough, never is
[t] Router
##Purchased this router becuase I was having problems steaming movies over my home network with my old router
##This router fixed that probelm
##I have not experianced any issues with this product and currently have no complaints
[t] Took time to setup - But after that works spotlessly
##As soon as I connected the router to the newly setup modem, it wouldn't show a connection to the net
##I then cloned the MAC address from my previous wireless router and restarted the modem
##Not sure if this was the right way to set it up, but it worked
##[I didn't use the included CD or setup wizard] Haven't lost wireless connection even once after purchase [2 months]
##I have 3 wired connections (gaming laptop, work laptop and Xbox) and another 4 laptops connected by wireless for at least 6 hours a day as well as 3 android phones [WIFI] and 2 iPod touch devices connected intermittently throughout the night on weekdays and most of the time during the weekends
##Connection timeout set at 7 days but have never experienced it
##This is heaven compared to my 4 year old Belkin which would require manual restarts for the dropped connections to reconnect
[t] Great for Netflix!!!
##5 Stars Great! Purchased to hook up Netflix
##Placed in my downstairs office to work in my upstairs master bedroom
port[@][u]##Works great over a long distance away from one another!Thank You for a great 8  wireless system!!! No trouble here!! Love it! Some people said they had loud sounds with their
##My is quiet
[t] Addressed All My Routing Needs
##We needed a replacement after our old router started to misbehave
##After reading mostly positive reviews I tried a cheaper Cisco-Linksys
##It had a major issue with DHCP (as was described in some of the negative reviews) and I had to return it
internet[@]##The more expensive D-Link was my second attempt to get reliable internet
##First of all, automatic setup did not work, but I had absolutely no problems with a manual set up
##If you know what you are doing, don't bother with automatic setup
##Second, you can share a USB device through the router, but not every USB device
##For example, my Lexmark Prospect Pro205 printer did not work
##However, the printer has a wireless capability and I connected it to the router with no issues
##After that, everything worked great
[t] router review
speed[@]##easy to set up and speed did increase as if connected to the modem directly
##slows down when more than one person on for gaming
[t] Unreliable junk
##I have this router for a few months and its wireless performance is terrible
##File transfer speeds are about 5 times lower then on my previous SMC router
##In addition - wireless connectivity break daily for no apparent reason, and since wired connections keep working at the same time I cannot blame my provider
[t] D-LInk DIR-655 Wireless Router
##The router was easy to set up and get working
price[@]##The price was right for my budget and more than comparative to anything I found at the big box electronic stores
internet[@]##My internet provider, BrightHouse wanted to charge me $149 for someone to come hook up a router which would only be a rental and still belong to them
##For less than half that price, I purchased my own unit thru Amazon and set it up without having to wait around all day for a technician to show up
##It took me less than a half hour to get back to surfing the net
installation[@]##I would recommend this product for ease of installation and satisfaction with use
##It functions well for my needs
[t] Works great
##This was recommended by an IT professional to replace my time warner wireless modem
##Output is very fast and I have yet to have any more "buffering video" icon's displayed
[t] Good solid router
##Replaced an aging wireless router with this one and am pretty pleased
##Excellent config options and reliable operation
##I thought my overall signal would be improved, but really, not so much
[t] Best
##I've always trusted D-link products
##The router before this served for about 8 years and was still functional
##This is no exception
[t] Would try another brand next time.
##Had some compatibility issues
##Hard to find answers, instuctions & help just ran me in circles with no quick fix
[t] Dlink
##Very good item
##hooked it up and didnt look back
internet[@]##No sudden internet drops
##However when you set up wep you lose stregnth in signal
[t] Still the best
port[@]##Flawless!! Was using the Rev A, Ordered a new one and got Rev B with the linux chip and OS and now I dont have to reboot after setting a port forward or something! Menu navigation is faster
##Love this router
[t] Beware of the Wizard
##I writing to let you know that the other positive reviews are correct, but they need to warn you off the use of the "Wizard" CD enclosed in the package
##I've setup several DIR-655's
##The first time I followed the instructions and used the "Wizard"
##It caused so much grief that I had to delete it out of my system
##When I didn't use the "Wizard" setup was a snap
##But know that the Netgear N900 has more range when on the low band
[t] Great product!
##One of the best wifi routers that I've bought
##Like the fact that it has the USB connection on the router where I was able to plug in my external hard drive and access it from my network
software[@]##Only down side is that only one user can be logged into the external at at time using the software the router came with
##And the lights in the front of the router look pretty cool at night
[t] Great product
##Overall this product is great; Easy to set-up, good wireless reception, and good for its money worth
##Con
[t] Nothing Special
##The wireless portion of the router just gave out after two years of below average use
##Overall, it was a good router, when it was working
##I am not a very heavy user of wireless networking
streaming[@][u]##Used the router for basic office connectivity and surfing the web and  video to multiple devices simultaneously
##I do not know what the longevity of a router is suppose to be but I would have thought more than 2 years
##For example, my cable modem is about 8 years old and still going strong
##Lastly, the LED lights on the router are quite bright
##Thus, I do not think that it can be kept in a bedroom unless the lights are covered
[t] It's a router
##Its alright, looks really weird but only had a couple disconnects
##Pretty much an average router
##So far so good had it for 2 weeks now
[t] Excellent Product!
##Pros
[t] 4.5 stars
##I've had this new router for about a month
##It was fairly easy to setup and worked great out of the box
##Our old router we had to unplug almost everyday and "restart" and it was quite a hassle
##Haven't had a single issue with this router and it is definitely faster as well
##Product works as described, it is worth the money
[t] Have worse signal strength than a Verizon router..
##I bought this router to replace my own Verizon wireless-g router
##I searched the reviews and found out it would be fit to my 3 story house
##However the truth is it has worse signal strength than my Verizon router!I tried searching for the solution online, updated the firmware to the latest version, using the WPA2 AES encryption, trying different mode (b+g+n, g+n, g only, n only
##)but the signal strength is still weaker than my Verizon router in any places of my house
##(I compared them by putting them side by side)It is quite disappointed since I was expected a much stronger signal with the wireless-n by its 14x faster speeds and 6x farther range description
##I am returning it and simply keep my old router
[t] May work well for a while
##I purchased one 3 years ago
##Just after 1 year of use (and the 1 year warranty period) the router totally died
##I ordered a new one which worked well for almost 2 years, at which point the wireless LAN would intermittently go out
##When I tried to update to the latest firmware (over a wired connection) the router malfunctioned and no longer works due to a failed FW load
##Don't expect this router to last more than a year or so
[t] Constantly getting disconnected while streaming on Roku and PS3
streaming[@]##Constantly getting disconnected while streaming on Roku and PS3
##I updated the firmware twice and doesn't seem to fix the problem
##Signal is not that great either
##I can see the bar on my Ipad moving up and down while sitting in the same spot
##Very disappointed
[t] Dead after 2.5 years
##My 655 lasted ~ 2
##5 years before starting to overheat (at which point I'd have to manually reset it to get the connection back)
##I had a Netgear do this before and at least on that one, I was able to write a script to monitor it, and do the reset automatically, I but I was never able to get my script to get past the DLink admin login
##For the most part the 655 did its job
##I am puzzled to see it gets some of the best reviews around
##ie
##that's more of a statement that the firmware on so many other products is lacking
##The worst part of the 655 is the Dlink support forums
##I mean support forums are usually for folks having trouble
##but the admins there readily remove the worst complaints and/or if you make any reference that products other than Dlink
##For me, I did a side-grade to a single-band Asus
##Got my setup xfer'd over from the 655 in ~10 minutes
##Slightly better signal too
[t] Great product
##We purchased this router to replace one we have had for many years
##This one is so much more efficient, we love it
[t] Great router! I bought this when it was brand new
##I bought this router several years ago when wireless N still was being finalized as a standard
##I'm shocked the model number hasn't changed, but why mess with perfection
security[@],speed[@]##This router has provided me with great security and great coverage with speed in my home
security[@]##These are the security steps I was able to implement
##I made my wireless network "invisible"
##The only way to connect is if you know the name I chose for my network
##I used the MAC filters to only allow devices who's MAC's I've listed
##Of course I use a strong password on the router (make sure you change the admin password
##surprising how many people don't)
##I also set up a very strong password for the network and used WPA2
##Since I only use N, I programmed it not to allow anything else
##It wasn't so much paranoia that made me take these steps
##it was just cool that I could
##Firmware updates are pretty simple too
##In addition to the wireless, there are 4 wired ethernet ports as well
internet[@]##One other thing I really liked, which might matter to someone who has an HD TV with only wired internet connections
##I have the router on my fireplace mantel, facing the wall
##I was able to slide the front so that the little blinking status lights are not able to be seen
##even in the dark
##If you like to watch your movies in the dark, you won't be distracted by any of the blinking status lights
internet[@]##Streaming internet TV shows was easy because of this
##Not to mention being able to do firmware updates on the TV using an ethernet connection
##I noticed a few people mentioned over heating issues
##While the router has a little warmth, it does not run too hot
##Since I've been using mine for several years (I'm thinking around 5), that should prove the router is very durable
##I highly recommend this router!
[t] Not worth upgrading from DGL-4300
##I have the DGL-4300 and thought I'd try the DIR-655 to take advantage of the wireless-n built into my new Macbook Pro
##Turns out, the DGL-4300 has a 100% signal strength and consistent 54mbps whereas the DIR-655 from the same distance (about 50ft and two walls) only managed about 65% and 58mbps at best
##My recommendation
##keep your DGL-4300
##UPDATE
[t] Very pleased with my purchase thusfar
##Allright, this is the 3rd router i've installed
##I'm using this to replace my old Linksys router
##Installing this router is not as easy to install as my Aunt's Netgear WPN824 (which will put out 108mbps with excellent range)
##However the install isn't too tough and is comparable in interface to the old Linksys
speed[@][u]##Once i have this thing up and running it is great! When used in conjunction with the D-Link Xtreme N Notebook Adapter (DWA-652) ( I HIGHLY recommend the card as it gives exceptional range) i'm getting 300mbps  on the fence of my property from 150feet away through multiple walls
##In case i need to stream video on my fence for some reason
##This equipment is probably overkill for the purposes the setup, however with 4 people using 5 computers in the household we need all the help we can get and it looks likely this router will provide for that and then some for at least the next few years
##ALSO
[t] Great router - but software on signal-receiving computer matters!
##The good news with this router is that I've never had better range or signal strength
##The bad news is that I spent almost a full day trying to figure out why my connection would die every few minutes
##The culprit
[t] A worthwhile purchase
##When I began searching for a new router, my criteria were
[t] all I want
##Enabled me to multiple surf, play online games on my wireless laptop without any noticeable lag
##I was able to take advantage of redirecting web requests to my desktop so I can use my computer as a web server
##I printed the manual on the CD
##I haven't explored all the features yet but it seems so far that I got what I wanted
[t] So far so good
##Shopped for a router for a while, took a chance on this one
##First one was a lemon -- after calling D-link support, they told me to return it
##Just bought a replacement, and this time setup was a snap
##Network range is improved, but not stunning
##That may have more to do with the peculiarities of our house, hard to know
##Most importantly, it works as advertised thus far!
[t] buy far the worst router I have ever bought
##Quit after 13 months
##I will never by DLink products again
##I wish I didn't need a router since I have gone thru 5 in the last dozen years
##Why are these products not lasting? I have built over 30 computers from scratch and have had few component failures
##Why can't routers last more than a few years?
[t] Not bad, not great.
##I bought this to replace another aging D-Link that gave me several years of excellent service
##It still works, but I wanted to take advantage of the N protocol that my new laptops had installed
##To that end, I am very happy
##The speeds were a tremendous upgrade over the B/G router I was using before and the connection is very reliable
##To my knowledge, it hasn't lost its link with any of my wireless devices a single time in the 6 months I've been using it (not including a couple iPod Touches I have, but that's par for the course with those, I suppose)
security[@]##It has tons of setup, customization, and security options and the parental control settings, the scheduling in particular, are second to none
##The one gripe I have is this
[t] Hideous setup attempts; never worked!!
software[@]##If you have a Mac OSX system, you cannot use the setup software included in the setup disk
software[@]##Even if you have a Windows computer, the setup software may never work
##I spent half a day trying to set up this router, and it kept failing at the end of the setup
##Many people have this problem
##The posts say that you can set up the router via Ethernet connection without the setup program, but I was unable to connect to the router through its 192
##168
##0
##1 IP address without it being initially set up
##A complete waste of money
##Please read the comments on-line about this router before you buy it
##Tech support is not very helpful
[t] Good for Comcast customers who want to upgrade!
##I don't know about some of these negative reviews, but mines seems to function according to specification
##I believe that the negative reviewers did not take into accountability several factors
[t] did not work even after hours on the phone
##I bought it to be a router and print server
##The router function worked
##The print server did not work
##I spent hours on the phone with tech support
##Twice, they asked me to "rest" my hardware
##I'm not joking
##It sure sounded like an excuse just to get me off the phone
##At the end, they offered an RMA
software[@][u]##Among the things I had to do was install new firmware and a new version of the print server 
##None of this worked and was an enormous waste of time and energy
software[@]##Their software would just hang up, blinking and doing nothing, endlessly
##I will never buy another Dlink product
[t] What can I say
##It's easy to install
##it's fast
##I can be anywhere in the house, the garage, or in the yard and connect, good signal strength
##I only gave it 4 stars because the blue lights are so bright, then again that's why they make duct tape!
[t] Easy to set up + connect to
##This router was easy to set up, even for a novice like me - even easier to connect other devices to
##The setup also saves a copy of your settings to your desktop, so you can access that anytime
##I had another desktop, a Wii, and a blue ray player all connected in minutes
[t] DLink DIR-655 Review
##The 655 is a great product
##It's easy to install and has an easy to use admin facility
##The only thing I didn't expect was that I also had to add my wired PCs and my wired Xbox's mac addresses to the mac address filter
##No problem, just make sure that letters are capitalized and you use colons when entering the mac addresses in to the list
[t] Own two, work great, superior firewall and QoS features
##We are very satisfied with the two DIR-655s that we have (at two sites)
##They hold up well and cause no problems
##They're fast and stable; they run cool and basically require little or no attention
##Two router features that deserve much more discussion than they usually get are the unit's firewall (if any) and its Quality-of-Service (QoS) engine (if any)
##o The firewall keeps external probes and hack-attempts out of your network
##You'd be amazed how many probes a home or business broadband connection gets every hour from places like China, Eastern Europe and the Middle East
##They're looking for ways in so they can infect your machines and steal your information
##A router with a good firewall implemented in its firmware is increasingly essential
##Firewalls let internal users establish connections with remote machines, not the other way around
##And the DIR-655's firewall is excellent, a stateful-packet-inspection implementation that is truly industrial-class
##Frankly, I didn't know this when I bought my first unit but was delighted to discover it once I brought it home
##Good stuff
##And, it's compatible with my company's virtual-private-network (VPN) approaches, which can be a real problem for firewalls to accommodate
##My company has used two VPN approaches in the time I've had our DIR-655s, and there have been no issues
##o A good QoS engine prioritizes time-critical Internet traffic such as voice-over-Internet (VoIP)
##I did not fully appreciate this until we pulled the plug on our landline and implemented "roll-your-own VoIP", saving 90% off our monthly phone costs (see www
##Unvexed
##info for details)
##Only a router with good QoS capabilities will allow phone calls to be clear, crisp and smooth in the face of other Internet traffic
##And the DIR-655 turns out to have a very good QoS engine
streaming[@]##It automatically prioritizes the standard VoIP ports so our phone calls sound as good as a landline even with two teenagers streaming video, cruising Facebook, listening to Pandora, Skyping and FaceTime-ing, etc
##Unfortunately, the marketplace is not yet fully aware of the benefits of a good QoS engine in routers, so it's not a given
##Even Apple's well-regarded and excellent Time Capsule and Airport/Airport Extreme routers don't have it, for example
##But DIR-655 does
##The only issue we've ever experienced with the DIR-655s in our years of usage was once when a cell phone got into a conniption loop that had it disassociate and reassociate with the router over and over and over again, many times per minute
##This caused the router to bog down and reboot itself (and who could blame it)
##The DIR-655's informative logs helped me diagnose what was going on
##Eventually the phone got straightened out, and the problem went away
[t] Gamers please read
##I finally upgraded my old wireless router so that more of my house would have good coverage
##Everything went smoothly until I tried to set my PS3 to dmz to get an open nat
##I really felt I had configured everything properly as this wasn't my first rodeo, but it wouldn't work
##I finally broke down and called tech support
##We started by isolating the problem and it took hours
##I plugged my PS3 straight into the modem and got an open nat
##We walked through all the steps I had already done and did them the same
##Finally, he suggested we upgrade the firmware and save my configuration so we could upload after the update
##Once this was done it worked
##The only thing that was different wast he firmware
##This cost me hours of frustration
##I would give this product 5 stars, but I feel it should work correctly out of the box
[t] Dir-655 Super router!!
##I received this router and it was packed very well
antennas[@]##The router looks very impressive with it's "white" case and three antennas attached
##The blue LED's are very bright in low light environments but do look very cool
##The setup was extremely easy, much easier than my last router
##I was able to set up a password instead of using a "very" long alphanumeric password provided by the manufacturer
##This makes adding other components much easier
##Before I had to find the password and enter it in each time
##The D-Link website is setup well and has good usable information
##I was up and running with this router in less than thirty minutes
##I have been using this router for about three months now and I would recommend this product to my friends
[t] Great Product!
##Gets excellent range and very easy to set up! I recommend this product to anyone
##It came as promised and on time, yay Amazon!
[t] very good router
##I have been using this Router for last month or so
##and below are my observations
##I connected total 5 devices and all are working like charm wihout any connection issues
##Far betten than my old router
##pros
[t] DIR-655 Router Review
##Not worth going into a lot of technical details, but router works great and as described
##Signal is strong everywhere in my house
##Price was right here on Amazon!
[t] Can't hold a connection
##This router fails consistently
##It cannot maintain a connection
##I have tried to correct this in the advanced settings but it is still a disappointment
##It takes several minutes to connect to the router and it often fails while using it
##This router needs to be reset too often in order to connect
##I am now shopping for a replacement
[t] Good Hardware, Really bad firmware
##I've had this device for a number of years now
##Once you get this device working it's pretty good
##First, the firmware it came with was really SLOW
speed[@]##Once I updated the firmware the wireless speed DOUBLED! I don't think the mfg should have ever shipped the unit with crippled firmware
##Even with the latest firmware there is still something really buggy related to the date/time setup and with saving changes
##I know it sounds bizarre but my unit stopped working for days and I eventually traced it down to the date/time setting
##For a while I used the manual time settings but if you want to set up a schedule that doesn't work because it only keeps accurate time for about AN HOUR! After that the time just gets further and further off
##Pretty soon you're not even on the correct day
##I once tried to use a non DLINK time server and the unit became a brick until I did a factory default reset
##I DON'T RECOMMEND typing in a valid time server
##The schedule settings for the wireless are really lame
##You can set a start time and stop time and select days but the start and stop are the same for EVERY day
##In other words you can't set up a weekly schedule and have different times for the weekends than you can for the weekdays
##You can set up more than one schedule but then you have to remember to go in and select the new schedule (twice - see below) and reboot when you want to switch to the other schedule
##Then on Monday you have to remember to repeat the process
##Just ridiculously limited and lame, for no reason that I can determine
##Given the shoddy quality of the firmware maybe making this feature a little more useful was just beyond their ability
##To this day when you change settings often nothing happens
##I have just learned to hit the "Save Settngs" twice
##For some reason the settings seem to take the 2nd time most of the time
##Also all the changes I need to make seem to require rebooting the unit
##This is how the unit works AFTER several firmware updates
##I'm now up to 1
##33NA (The NA by the way stands for North American)
##This version was updated in Jan 2010 and the device reports that it is the latest update available, but I would rate the quality as early beta at best
##They either don't test or they ship with LOTS of known bugs
speed[@]##Once I got the unit updated to a version that worked with a time server the coverage and speed are pretty good
##I'm just afraid to touch the box now because it seems so temperamental
##In the future I'll try to find a mfg
software[@]##that hires decent software engineers or at least outsources to a semi-competent firm
[t] Very good, muito bom mesmo.
##Empresa muito eficiente
##Realizou a entrega em tempo h&aacute;bil e de acordo com que foi comprado
##Parab&eacute;ns
##Indico para qualquer cliente
[t] horrible interface
##pro
[t] It is a "Junk"
##Do not waste your time
##It does not work
##I spent at least a week, changing all sorts of settings
##It did not work
##I returned it
[t] Very Good Router
##We use our wireless and Ethernet connections for about eight different devices
##I purchased this router based on the reviews I read from other owners
##What I was looking for was reliable wireless connectivity
##My previous D-Link router would drop the connection on a regular basis
##This may be due to the size and shape of my home
##I installed a new firmware version in my previous router and connectivity became worse
##I thought this may be a good time to update the router
installation[@][u]##The  for the DIR-655 took a little longer than what others reported
##I had to install it manually rather than use the wizard
##This took about half an hour to confirm the settings
##I have had the router installed for about a month now and the performance has been exactly what I am looking for
##I have not had to reboot the router since it was initially installed
##In summary, I would recommend this router
software[@]##The software is easy to use and once it is configured, it keeps doing its magic
##The best router is one that works without requiring constant attention
[t] Short review for having it a short time
##I've only had the router for a couple of days
##I am coming from a Belkin router that I've used for several years
##The first thing I noticed right away is that the D-Link router is aesthetically pleasant to look at
##I love the blue lights and the size
##Another thing is that it does not run hot at all
##Once I got into the config window I was pleasantly surprised by the configuration options
##It is a real beast with settings and niceties which I did not expect
##Besides the above I like
[t] Great router!
##I received the refurbished router faster than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise
##It came with everything I needed, looked brand new
##Went through set up according to the cd, but to no avail
##Tried following just the pamphlet directions, and still had a bit of trouble
##I called D-Link, and although it took me a couple of times to get through, as when they are busy you just get a message that says there is no one available at the time
##I finally reached a tech, who helped me get it set up
##It wasn't anyone's fault but my own though, I am not a techie and had trouble setting up the last router I had as well
speed[@]##I have to say my husband and I see a marked difference in speed compared to our last router, a Belkin 54g, which would receive a maximum of 36 mbps at close range
##We are getting at least double that from down stairs
##I haven't tried it sitting next to the router since it is in our closet with the wire panel box and modem
##We have a big house, and I get great reception everywhere I've tried it
##Its lightning fast, and I really like the features that allow us to have a guest network without sharing our network code, and I like being able to set up my external hard drive wirelessly so I can back up my computer files all the time without having to drag out the hard drive and hook it up
##Printer works great on it too, but we do have a wifi printer, so it worked with the old Belkin anyway
##Reason I went with this one is it got good reviews from both cnet
##com and zdnet
##com, both said it had great range which we need for our large home
price[@]##Bottom line for me is, this is an excellent router and the refurbished price is excellent too
##And it works as well as brand new, so why pay more?
[t] Poor reception outside 30', Signal Drops
##We were hopeful for good results with this router
antennas[@][u]##The very bright blue lights on the front are snazzy and the 3  give the illusion of transmitting power
##Illusion
##Outside of 30' the signal for us dropped dramatically
##We live in a standard home with drywall interior walls with no insulation or other factors that would normally reduce the signal (large aquariums, bronze statues, etc
##) The signal within 30' seems pretty solid, although for some reason it seems to completely drop the signal to zero once or twice an hour
internet[@]##We have a back bedroom aboout 40' away, and while we do get a weak signal on laptops (1-2 bars) we get no reception on the X-Box, Playstation or Samsung internet equipped TV located there
##We got equal or better reception with our crappy 8 year old combination modem/router provided to us by the phone company
##Nertz
##We certainly expected an improvement of some kind
##No dice
##although we did not experience the extreme heat issues reported in other reviews-that would of at least allowed us to make grilled cheese on thing once in a while, giving it some utility for us
##We will be returning the unit and trying a different one
[t] Horrible Router
##Worst router I ever bought
##Horribly unstable
##Not supported well by DLink
##I am happily spending the money to replace it after 2 years of fighting with connectivity issues and router crashes
[t] Good choice for our home network
##Very good for setting up our small home network
##We run a desk top and lap top via this network, plus a kindle
internet[@]##When the kids visit they have their lap tops and allows everyone internet access without having to "schedule" time to check emails, FB, etc
##I am not a tech wizarrd, but it was pretty easy to set up and have operating in less than 1 hour total
##which includes reading directions
[t] Incredibly easy installation!
##I had been using a 25' cord that tethered my laptop to a cable modem upstairs because I'm not tech-savvy and didn't think I could install a wireless router on my own
##I invested a couple of hours one evening reading online reviews posted on sites I trust, including Amazon
##com, and finally decided to take the plunge with the D-Link 655 router
##Best purchase ever! I was able to install it in less than 30 minutes
##and it works perfectly
port[@][u]##The USB printer  is icing on the cake - I couldn't be happier with this product
[t] Many features, easy to configure
##I bought this router to replace my WRT-54G which was working fine for many years
##I wanted to upgrade to GB ethernet and 802
##11n from the 100 MB/s and 802
##11g on the old router
##I did not expect to find as many additional features available to me once I had made the upgrade
##Some of the feature upgrades that I found handy besides the increased connection speeds were
[t] Great
##Bought 2 of these about a year ago
##One for my mother-in-law and one for me
##Setting up was a breeze
##It works great
##Wouldn't trade it for another
[t] To much for a nerd
##Bought this d-link on the advice of a friend
##He thought I was an electronic whiz
##I've never got it to work with a DSL modem
##The DVD and the manual setup tells me it's right it still wont work
##I'll get old computer brain to hook it up for me
[t] DIR-655
##Worked as promised to replace a slightly older (but still working) D-Link router
##The only issue I had setting it up was in the config wireless menu
##It kept loging me off everytime I tried to change a wireless channel (the higher ones)
##Was finally able to get the config to work
internet[@]##My daughter has had some wireless issues with lack of internet connectivity but haven't figured out if it's the router or her laptop (she ends up rebooting the laptop and fixing it before I can look at it)
##D-Link support was great to help fix an initial set-up problem of no DSL connectivity
##Update
[t] They cut corners, The new revised B1 hardware sucks
##Side by side, they made the new B1 units cheap
##After a month or two, the signal strength on the new one is getting weaker every day
##Do not buy the D-Link DIR-655 Revision B1 hardware
##I loved the old ones I bought 2 years ago, too bad they cut corners and turned a good "A" product to a junk "B"
##If you need to replace any old ones like I did, and you loved the old one, forget it, these new units are garbage
##Update Jan 29,2012
[t] When it works it is great
##Okay, I am not writing this as a brand new owner
##I have had this router for almost a year
##It works well and is fast
##The largest problem/issue I have is that it will randomly just drop the connection
##It stops broadcasting the signal
##I verified it wasn't the ISP by having another devices connected to it that should be able to communicate if it was an ISP problem
##So, long story short
##If you want inexpensive and works pretty good then buy
internet[@]##If you game with it or do any form of internet based work, shy away since you could be in the middle of something and lose all of your work since your last save or if gaming, you will just die and leave your teammates going nuts
[t] Great bang for the buck
##This is a great buy as far as I know
##With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch
[t] 3 year Follow up and more
##I've had this router for 3 years and going it is OUTSTANDING and very RELIABLE
##I have the 1
##21 firmware version (hardware A4) have read negative things about the newer firmware versions so I never updated since I'm happy with this one
##D-Link has good products as long as you don't update firmware
##D-Link DIR-655 has medium-excellent range very good stable connection on channels and advanced features available through web browser
##Best of both worlds for my urban/medium traffic area
##I also have tested Cisco routers Linksys are easy setup but do not offer advanced features and requires disk for it
##It has medium-above avg range but you must have the latest firmware on those
##Cisco routers drop connections once in a while you may have to manually reset power on the router 1-2 month
##Netgear has medium-excellent range a bit harder to setup than Linksys but has a more stable connection platform
##One thing Netgear has over DLink is the advanced features is a bit easier to navigate
##Netgear's firmware varies sometimes there better than the one you have sometimes there not just do a little research
software[@]##If you plan on buying different brands and just integrating them WATCH OUT cause most of them have PROPRIETARY software
##Which means for ex
##(if you buy dlink it will only work with same brand products
software[@]##) This is why most people result to DD-WRT or Tomato (expert) firmware since open source software gives better options and gives greater router capability
##For the most part most routers I tested felt warm-bit hot temperature
##If your router heats up a bit try using aluminum foil to dissipate heat(heat will hopefully travel away) or put it on half-inch stands (maybe couple of quarters as legs) so the air can circulate a bit
##Hope this helps out at least 1 person in memory of Steve Jobs
[t] Terrible Product
##This product is unreliable and it is incompatible with other D-Link products
##I had high hopes for it, but found it would restart constantly when there was any significant traffic going through it
##Moreover, when I tried to run it in "Pre-N" mode with an AppleTV, I was unable to get it to connect at anything higher than 54Mbps and would not work at all with another D-Link product (Wireless Game adapter) that only supported "G" mode
##I was also very concerned about the longevity of the product because it runs very hot
##I spent numerous hours on hold with D-Link tech support and ultimately switched back to my old, reliable Linksys WRT-54G and added a Gig-E switch to connect my fastest wired devices
##Unfortunately I went past 30 days trying to get the DIR-655 to work reliably and the return period expired
[t] Range is poor
##I am somewhat knowledgeable about networking
##I have networked my home computers several times
##I am knowledgeable about computer programming
speed[@]##I bought this router for increased speed and hopefully range
speed[@]##The speed increased but the range did not
##The range is still mediocre at 20 feet
##I found the user interfaces on Netgear products to be superior as they provide additional advance settings
##In the past, I found that using USB corded "network cards" are better than network cards that stick out the back of the computer since you can place the corded USB adapters in varios positions (away from the computer) to increase range
##I would not recommend this product if you require an increase in range
[t] The worst router
##This router takes a rocket scientist to install
##I tried for one hour and this just cannot be connected
##I had the same problems with my old D-Link router too
##The worst router ever!~
[t] Never D-Link
##Okay this router might be fast, but that is when it works
##This is our second d-link router, we bout this one to replace our older d-link which had many issues
##This one is no better
##Disconnected weekly at first, then daily, now we sent it to get it refunded for now-a-days it disconnects 4-5 times a day min
##There been times it'd disconnect 10 times in less then 10 mins
##I HIGHLY suggest you not to buy it
[t] I was looking for a gig router and saw this one. Price seemed to be right. But it is not supported by d-link anymore
##I was looking for a gig router and saw this one
##Price seemed to be right
##But it is not supported by d-link anymore per their customer service
##It did not work for me
##Especially the wi-fi
##I would not recommend it
[t] mr
##This is OK for taked money
##Thank
##What I am waiting, that I have
##I That is exselent woring and come in time
[t] If I could give it 0 stars I would.
##Quick setup doesn't work, manual setup doesn't work
##The router just doesn't work
##It's frustrating to have your packaging 3 days late and have everyone (UPS especially) telling you it's out for delivery, three days running and still not here
##But despite that you feel joy when it's finally in your hands
##But wait there is a twist, two out of the three of items you've ordered just doesn't work
##This one in particular is frustrating, first of all they only send you one Ethernet cable when the setup itself requires two (forget about even thinking a usb cable is there)
software[@]##The instructions are unclear both in the manual and the software
##But if you've set up a router before you should know what goes where when
software[@]##If you go the software quick setup route, you will have to restart the program multiple times for it to finally work and at the end when it says you are connected to the internet, guess what
##you aren't
##If you try to go the manual route, it doesn't allow to you save the setting your are trying to implement at all!!Just forget about trying to create a wireless network all together
##Bottom line is nothing works
[t] D-Link Router sucks
##I bought d-link dir 655 brand new from amazon, paid 75 dollars
##I have been using it for about a week
##I'm constantly getting disconnected and need to reset
##got up one morning, the wireless network connection was completely missing
##again, need to reset the router
##I would give it zero star if I can
##Never, never, never buy d-link again
[t] Works well. . . while it's working.
##While this router is actually connected to the internet, I get excellent speeds
##I also get excellent speeds transferring files within my local network
internet[@]##Unfortunately, the router constantly drops its connection to the internet
##I've never seen its "Connection Up Time" statistic in the status screen higher than three hours, and very rarely above 30 minutes
internet[@]##I've done firmware upgrades and all kinds of tinkering with the settings based on endless internet searching
##The router remains totally unreliable
##Update
[t] Don's review
##I alway like or use d link products, never had a problem with any of them, really happy with this product
[t] THIS brand works!
price[@]##After I could not get either of two different Linksys E-3000 routers to connect to my notebook at speeds faster then 65Mbps, I sent them back for refund and bought this D-Link at half the price
##Right out of the box it connected to the laptop at 150Mbps just as other DLink routers have done
##No fuss, no muss, no hours on chat sessions and the phone getting excuses like at Cisco; it just WORKS!
[t] Better coverage than 802.11g (ex##I had DI-624(with an additional 9dbi antenna), and the range is not enough for my house
speed[@]##Even the signal is 3~4, the speed is terrible
speed[@]##But after I change this one(DIR655), the range and speed are better, it works
[t] Awful, never works correctly
##ALWAYS drops connections
##I am on here right now because it just did a second ago
##Every time it does (1x per day!) I have to manually unplug it
##DO not but this
[t] Excellent Case
##Nothing fancy to say
##It was easy to setup, and its been great ever since
speed[@]##Great speed and range on the wireless
##Price was right, too
##What more could I ask for?
[t] Very Very Very Good Acess Point
##10x Better than Linksys
##Wireless works 24/7 no drop outs
##Tons and tons of configuration options
##Too badd its white though but its behind my monitors and hidden from view
##Worth the $$ I spent for it
[t] Dir-655 + 1st Generation Apple TV +++ Boxee = Grrreat!!
##Glad I took the negative reviews for face value because it was an easy set up
##Took 10 minutes to connect (mostly because my wife was talking to me about maternity clothing but that's a differentstory) didn't use the CD so I'm not sure how that would have gone
##My/our home network consists of 2 Windows 7 x64 PCs, 1 Windows Server 2008R2 Enterprise (I'm an IT guy) and 1 W7x64 notebook and a host of Hyper-V servers, they all connected w/o incident
speed[@]##The speed is pretty good, I moved from a WRV200 Linksys and a Trendnet wireless N 65-something or other that should have been called a POS because that's pretty much what it was, a POS
##Kept that gem of an item for 2 1/2 months (lost the receipt = thanks dear!) because I didn't want to be bothered with trying to exchange it at a store that starts with an F and rhymes w/eyes, and all it did was push my buttons w/it's constantly dropping signals and a very upset wife because her notebook would never stay connected to the net
##Those were very very dark days
##ATV and Boxee work like well, like buttah - no buffering, caching or skipping (for the most part) and I see a definite difference in the load time for HD ATV movie trailers
##Didn't try the USB share thing because it isn't of real use to me
##In the end I'm happy with my purchase, let's see what happens in the next few days and weeks
##------------------Update - 3/6/2011So I've had this thing since mid-December and haven't had any real complaints (from the Mrs
##- well aside from not remembering to take out the trash
##) Haven't had to reboot nor does it get warm like some other folks have mentioned
##My only slight wah-t-ever would be that it has a 24 MAC address limit
##Since I work with virtualizedPC's (and get out of hand from time to time) I have to remind myself to get too crazy
##Yes I could turn off MAC filtering but that would keep me awake at night wondering who was knocking at my cyber door
##Yes yes MAC filtering may not be the end all however the false sense of assurance (sort of like a rebate that never gets sent in!) puts me slightly at ease
##Even if I have a hardware firewall
##I did experience a "heyyyyy!" last week with the Guest Zone
##For some reason it didn't like the SSID of FreeRange, I didn't suffer loss in connectivity, I couldn't access the router
##Changed the name and all was well
##Overall I'm still happy that I went with this as opposed to something more expensive (wouldn't have done that because I like a good steal!) Now if only I could remember to take out the trash!!!
[t] My brief review
##I have Verizon FiOS Quadruple Play at my home with FiOS Internet at 20 MBps download and 5 MBps upload speeds
##Verizon supplies an Actiontec MI424WR 2
##4 GHz single band 802
port[@]##11 B/G Router with a four port 10/100 MBps Ethernet Switch for its customers
##The ONT uses a 75 Ohm Coaxial cable connection to the MI424WR
##I have to disable the internal routing, wireless, and firewall to the MI424WR and setup an Ethernet Bridge to the D-LINK DIR-655
##I chose this product because I wanted a proven, stable, and fast router and switch that had 2
##4 GHz 802
streaming[@],port[@][u]##11 B/G/N with QoS for streaming HD video content at 1080p resolution and multi-channel surround sound, VPN support, and a four  10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet Switch
##I connect a Category 5e Patch cable through the WAN ports of the MI424WR and DIR-655 to establish the physical link for the Ethernet Bridge
##The range tripled in my home
##There are no dead spots from the attic to the basement of my home anymore
speed[@]##The speed especially when connected to a 2
##4 GHz 802
##11n signal is phenomenal
##I upgraded to the latest firmware version 1
##32NA final immediately and I have had no problems whatsoever
##The only downside to this product is the SharePort feature
##It only allows one person to have exclusive access to a device that is plugged into the USB 2
port[@]##0 port located on the back of the router and switch
##The good thing about it is that you can connect any USB 1
##1 or 2
##0 compliant device and it will work as if it were connected directly to your PC
##So far, I have connected an external SATA Western Digital Caviar Green hard drive through a ThermalTake BlackX hard drive dock and it too works
streaming[@][u]##I have not tested the QoS for HD video  yet because I do not own such a product for my home entertainment system
##I have tested the QoS profile for Skype and it works well though
##Videoconferencing is smooth through the wireless connection as well as the Ethernet connection
##This product used to be an expensive product several years ago
price[@]##It is dramatically reduced in price because it is a single band router and switch
##For most people, this is sufficient for their needs
##I highly recommend this product to others looking for an easy to setup and powerful single band router and switch on the market
##It is compatible with Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, and 7
[t] Better than a linksys
speed[@]##This router is a good addition to my house, wireless range is great, but the speed is just OK
speed[@]##I have updated the firmware and got some geek advice online to increase the speed
##All in all a great router, don't waste your money on a "linksys" the d-link runs smoother and faster with NO dropped wireless
[t] worth of money!!
##im not good in writing reviews but i decided to do it for this item
##easy in instalation had to call customer support to secure the network but it was easy and really fast
##nothing complecated and it really works greate at this time
##this router will give you flexability with your wireless devices for sure!!
[t] 9 users on this wireless router. and it's still fast.
##There are 9 users total on this wireless, 4 via wire and 4 via wireless + xbox live
##And we don't just surf the web
##we play COD Black Ops on live, Starcraft II, we stream movies, music, and video chat etc
##we're in college dorms and this router is super fast
##I can't speak much of the wireless range because the wireless users are our next door neighbors
##Customer support and unit return should be N/A cause i never had to use it but i gave it 5 stars anyway
##there is a higher model, which i think is a 800 series
##It is newer and they say is better
##I did tons of research
##read all the reviews, consulted with CNET, and consumer report
##AND the Winner is D-Link Dir-655
##SUPER fast
[t] Difficult setup
##Problems right from the start
internet[@]##First, we couldn't get internet on any computer
##When we called customer support it took half an hour to get it working
##But there was no network security, so we spent another 2 hours setting that up
##Then, when I connected the laptop to the network, I kept getting "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" messages
##So we spent another hour trying to fix that
##We couldn't
##So we tryed to call tech support again, but we never got an answer
##All in all, DON'T BUY THIS!!
[t] A Horid Product with even worse customer service
##There are excellent instructions to install the router; however, the guidance on how to go "wireless" is incompete at best
##After 4 hours trying to get the wireless feature to work (which involves switching back from the awful instruction book to the less than helpful website where the router must be configured) I spent 2 hours being yelled at by a custmer service rep who failed to mention that I needed to key in a passcode from the bottom of the router
##I was never able to get the product to work with my laptop and would not recomend buying anything at all from the company unless you are willing to have a very rude woman yell at you for several hours before telling you to return the product
[t] jim
##Im sure this d-link router would have been fine if you could get it hooked up
##I,for the life of me had no luck with it
##Startup disk,Tech Support,I tried it all
##There tech support is a joke,and they did not have the time of day for me,much less understand there eastern indian accent
##I sent it back for a refund
##I'll stick with NetGear
[t] Printer sharing could be better
##It was disappointing that printer sharing requires the purchase of Network Magic to make it work - and then then sharing is slower than that of my previous router
[t] Excellent Router - Highly recommend it
##This router was perfect right out of the box
##I previously owned a Linksys Router which caused me untold headaches when used with Voip
##This router works perfectly with CallVantage VOIP
##The only con is that it is a bit pricey but still overall a good investment
[t] Satisfied..
##Works well and fast
##But i am a little bit concerned about the coverage range
[t] D-link N wireless router
##I have this product for more than three months
##We (whole family) use it everyday and feel very happy for it
##We locate it at the 2nd floor and be able to use the network in the basement
speed[@]##The speed of downloading or gaming is very good too
##A neighbor living at 200 yards away could use our network too
##Now let us hope this good product can last long
[t] No Good !
##Bought this router to upgrade my DGL 4300
##Bad decision, constant drop wireless connection
##I played the COD4, NBA, etc and this router always disconnect me from the server (a lot of times)
##I change all the settings and still dont work
##If you use it for gaming dont buy this router but get the gaming router the DGL4300 never regret it
[t] Excellent router!
##I like this router a lot
##I haven't had one problem with it so far, and the setup was so easy
##I have been able to play games and stream movies without a glitch
##I highly recommend it
[t] D-LINK REVIEW DIR655
##I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY MAJOR INCIDENT
##THE WIRELESS ROUTER IS EXCELLANT
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Router
##Great product, easy to install and use
##I have it in the basement and my laptop can access my home network fom anywhere in the house and out on the deck as well
##For the home user on a private network it is an excellent buy
##Amazon's policy and support are an added plus
[t] Great Product!!!
##Just replaced a Cisco with this unit and the difference is incredible! The Cisco would constantly cycle off and need to be rebooted at least five times a day
##The D-link DIR-655 has been flawless since day one! I was hoping for a little more range though
##The unit is on a different floor of the house than where I use my laptop and the distance is about 30 feet
##In hindsight, the standard "g" model would have probably done just a good since my main reason for getting the "n" was for range
speed[@]##Remember that even the fastest ISP can only hit ~50Mps, so the "n" only helps if transfering files between computers on the network and not improve your "surfing" or "online streaming" speed
[t] Reliable product
##This has been the most reliable wireless router I ever had
##It has been working for several months without reboot
##I had other brands that need reboot between a couple of days to a couple of weeks
[t] One of the best N routers on the market still!!
##Just purchased a second one for my summer house this time rev
##B which is ipv6 ready
##the Rev
##B seems better then rev
##A because it has more features you can enable and it seems to work well
##Always remember no matter what revision you have always update to the latest firmware so if you have any problems the update should fix it
##But any hows so far no complaints works 100% fine would defiantly buy another new one if needed
##Updated 6/15/12
[t] Color me impressed
##Wow
##Easiest time I've ever had with a router
##The only thing that slowed me down was the time I spent in the menus looking for ways to do things that, as it turned out, the router had already taken care of
##It didn't need to be told to clone the previous router's MAC address - it just did it
##That blew me away
port[@][u]##I was able to set up  forwarding and wireless networking without the manual or any sup calls
speed[@]##The unit replaced an 8 year old Linksys that had given good service, but was limiting my upload and download speed to 5M
##This one lets me reach the cable connection speeds (sometimes as high as 29M/6M)
speed[@]##Wireless range seems decent and the speed is excellent
##One reviewer complained about heat production
##Mine's been on all night and it's barely warm to the touch; it's running cooler than the cable modem
##(It is in a room that stays cool year around and it's got good airflow around it
##)Other have commented about the annoyingly bright blue LEDs
##I have to agree; they are bright enough to be irritating in a home theater
##I have mine facing the wall, and am considering a strip of electrical tape over the LEDs even then
software[@],port[@]##Hey, D-LINK? How about a software setting for the LED brightness next time?One minor nit is that after you make settings for port forwarding, the router needs to be rebooted before they take effect
##Granted, you don't twiddle forwarding very often, especially since you can reserve addresses based on MAC addresses so IPs don't change
##But the reboot process is slow and I don't see why it's necessary here
##So far, this thing's exceeded expectations
##Addendum
[t] D-link hit a home run with this router
##The best router yet
##I've had over a dozen routers over the years
##There is almost always some hassle setting it up or getting it to work properly
##Usually took at least one call to tech support
##I took this unit out of the box, followed the quick install directions, and I was up and running inside of 10 minutes
##The range is also way better than a previous D-link, Westell, or a 2WIRE router that were used previously
##If it keeps working as is, I'll be one happy camper
[t] Great range.
##I just bought a two story town home and was afraid that I would have to run wires downstairs because I wouldn't get reception for my laptop
##Well with this router I didn't
##I get "poor" signal from the other side of my house, but the speeds are still very good and I haven't lost connectivity once
##Great product, looks nice and was a BREEZE to set up
##I'm very computer literate but I can see someone who is not finding this very simple to setup
[t] Works great, even for a Novice
##This is our first purchase of a router and set up was quite easy
##We did have a problem with a laptop connecting of my husband's from school, so we called for help
##The technician did have to change some settings to get it to connect and since then we have had no problem
##We have had some visitors and they had no trouble connecting either
##Works well, haven't had any problems so far
##Speed is great and no dropped connections
[t] A Great Little Router!
##This baby came in the latest/greatest hardware version (B1) and firmware (2
##00NA) and is fast as lightnin! Solid, stable, reliable
##I combined with the DWA-556 PCIe Xtreme N wireless adapter on my brand new HP computer (YES, running WINDOWS 7!)
##I'm free of Ethernet cables *and* printer cables as the SharePort USB connection works like a charm with my Epson Workforce 500 printer
##What a combo!!!!
[t] I love it
##I will keep it short
##I have been using DLink wireless routers for the longest time
##Always had to keep rebooting every few days
##I have maybe had to reboot this one twice in the last 6 months
internet[@]##The family is really happy and I dont get cranky calls when I am on the road complaining that the internet is down again
##Peace of mind and peace at home
[t] So far so Good!
##I've had this product for several weeks now and so far so good
##No complaints what so ever and has worked as advertized
##I'm using this product to connect my office desktop to a wireless usb adapter downstairs
##D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapter
[t] Excellent router
##Great router with many options
##Setup time was quick
internet[@]##I was on the internet and using a secure WPA2 connection within minutes
##I would highly recommend this router
##Especially since you can do QoS with it as well!
[t] Works great .. but blew my IBM T40 wireless hardware in setup
##1
##Setup disk would not work, no replacement available
##2
##When I setup my router for secure access WPA2 with the help of support, it blew my IBM T40 internal wireless card
##I was hardwired to the DLINK during setup
##DLINK support claimed no resposibility
##For Windows to boot again, I had to disable the internal wireless in boot setup
##For the record, internal wireless card failed to work again when booting in Linux
##Reloaded internal card firmware to no avail
##Am now using an external wireless card
##3
##The Dlink USB is great, as I attached an external hard drive
software[@]##Need to download "DLink SharePort Network USB Utility" software to get access to the DLINK USB
##4
##Signal strength is better than what I had
##now very low to low from none to very low
##I expected more strength
[t] Extreme Makeover
##D-Link provides excellent setup wizard! Was told I might have problems hooking up but it was fool proof
##I periodically work from home so I installed on a Friddy in case I had excessive downtime troubleshooting
##start to end was less than an hour, no issues whatsoever
internet[@]##Was having numerous connectivity problems at home but installing the DIR-655 resolved all my problems and boosted signal strength and internet speeds
[t] Does not work wirelessly with all devices
##I bought this and it will not work wirelessly when password protected with my
[t] Very good router
##This router works very well
##I have heard that this router is the best on the market and I believe it
##As for it being expensive, it is worth every penny
[t] Easy Set Up
##I just received the D-link today so I gave it 4 stars
##I will update after I have had it for awhile
##The set up was easy and it took me 15 minutes to be up and running (my computer and my other wireless devices
##I have excellent range and does not take up alot of space
[t] D-Link Wireless Router
##The product is working very well
internet[@]##Had a little trouble having it speak with our internet provider and laptop, but was able to finally get working
##Since then, we have had no problem with the product
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
[t] Over rated, but I guess I'll keep it
##I know that 1000mbps is not reachable, BUT, I expected a little bit more
##Just got this yesterday, along with some CAT6 cable, already had the Belkin Gigabit NICs
##Tested by transferring a 374MB file via LAN, below are the results comparing to a LinkSys 54g router, both systems have enough memory where it will not use virtual memory and not accessing anything else on the LAN or WAN during the testLinkSys 54g
[t] Excellent Router
##I found the D-Link very easy to setup with great signal strength right from the start
##It works very well with VoIP! Would recommend to anyone looking to pay around $100
##00 for a great router
[t] D-Link Wireless Router DIR-655 Etreme N
##It works like a charm
##Read and followed the simple setup instructions
##I have a simple three computer setup with printer and file sharing
##Network Magic application helped tune up performance of overall network
security[@]##The combined applications' instructions are very simple to follow; especially, for setting encryption security and tweeking feature's performace
##One must read and follow instructions
##No magic or voodoo, just common sense and "git-r-done'
speed[@]##On my COX high speed broadband connection, I consistantly get 4,000 kb downloads and 1000 kb uploads, and the range of wireless devices from my wireless router is nothing short of awesome
##I highly recommended this D-Link routher for setting up a secure, hi-speed home network
[t] Excellent product
##I have been using this router for a couple of months now and it works great when wired or wirelessly
##I did have to call support about my adaptor, DWA-140, and they made changes to a few of the settings and it works beautifully
##It transfers files quickly and flawlessly even if the files are very large, over a gig
##Great router!
[t] Excellent Router For Long Range!
##I've had this router hooked up for about a week now and it is outstanding
##I have a Playstation 3 and an XBox 360 out in the living room and the router on the other end of the house in my office and both game consoles connect online flawlessly with strong signal strength
##The game consoles are about 200 feet from the router and it connects them seamlessly to the rest of my network
##A definite must have if you need a router with long range capability
[t] Great router, annoying bright lights
##My old Linksys died so I got this router a couple days ago
software[@]##The set-up CD was good though they try to sell you software on it
##More annoying though are the really bright blue lights
##It's in my bedroom, and, even with black electrical tape over the front, the whole thing glows brightly because the box is translucent
##It's very annoying
##Is there any way to turn off the lights without having to turn off the router?
[t] Easy networking - Powerful and fast
##The install for this was as easy as it can be and unlike all other routers I've had in the past it actually worked on day one without help from my DH
##Good range and fast speed, I highly recommend this wireless router
[t] Simple, does the job
##After reading these reviews, I bought this router
##I set it up using the CD in about 20 minutes
##Had 3 laptops working well in 1/2 hour, any delays were with firewalls
##It has worked well across the house nearly 50 feet away, and in the basement
##So far no dropped signal after about a week of use
[t] Fantastic Router! (Lasted 3 + years.)
##After a year with the Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster (that created an immense amount of frustration and anger due to constant disconnections to the internet), I went ahead and purchased this router after doing my research
##So far after a few months I have had a fantastic experience with this router
##My PC constantly has a connection
##I rarely lose my connection with my laptop
##Most importantly, in my bedroom I always have a connection, whereas before with my Linksys router I was finding it less and less common to be connected there
##Definitely make this purchase with confidence
security[@]##Very easy to add security to your network, etc
##One last thing, I used the startup disk to connect my PC to the router, but did not use the disc for my laptop
##Instead I just created my network first via my PC, then added my laptop to the network
##I recommend you do the same
##UPDATE (8
##12
##11)
[t] D-Link router
##It works fine
##I have had to reboot it and disconnect it a few times, but after a few weeks I think it's been worth the money (not cheap)
[t] Very Satisfied
##This router is a very nice product and efficient
##The change over from my previous router (D-Link) was a snap
##Somehow, most of the people working in my office, who changed their routers were not able to connect through to our office servers from home
##They used linksys as their new router
##I was reluctant to make the change but after D-Link to D-Link change I realized it was not a problem at all
speed[@]##The speed is great
##Response time is great and I have been using two VoIP connections on the same router without a problem
##The reception on both the phones have increased
##I am not a gaming person so
##But I would recommend this product
[t] No hassel fast wireless router!
##Another good product from D-Link that was easy to setup but also allows for lots of tweaks
speed[@]##It connected to my other wireless computers without any problems and gave me the speed boost I was looking for
##The best part is I no longer get drop-outs in some rooms
##As always Amazon delivered it quickly!
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Router
##So far so good
##It seems to run faster and not "drop" the computer as often as the old one (Linksys)
[t] D link
##This solved all of the problems I was having with my old router
##The range is awesome and I have not had to reset it once since I got it
##(had to do it a lot with my old one)I have also had no problems connecting other devices (Xbox Wii PS3)
##It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it well
##I don't know if you could get a better router for the money
[t] Good but not great.
##First off I'd buy this model again, so my criticisms may sound harsher than I mean
##The setup was easy, the connection to both the wired and wireless PCs are consistently good
##The flaw in the system is the networked USB device "Shareport" technology
##It is horrible
##There are several steps to get each PC configured with the Shareport Utility
##But after it's installed it randomly works
##One PC connects, the other doesn't always even see the printer connected or can't disconnect from it
##Sometimes powering off the Dlink DIR-655 corrects the problem, sometimes not
##I've had to pull the printer off the Dlink to get any kind of printer usage
##I hope Dlink gets there act together with the Shareport feature as that is a great plus
[t] D-Link Extreme is not extreme!
##I recently purchased the d-link dir-655 after extensive research on all brands
##I like the menus and options to configure Qos and traffic shaping feature
##I'm not sure if the Qos works well or not, but I use Magicjack, and it still seems not to give it enough priority over other network traffic
##I even tried prioritizing the computer that is plugged into Magicjack, but I'm not sure if it helped or not
##The most disappointment I have with this router is that it continually drops data connections to my HP Mediasmart server when I am transferring files
##I've had trouble with other routers as well, but I think my next purchase will be a Belkin N+ and see if that router is better
##I'm skeptical and it will probably drop as well
##I have tried auto channel selection as well as manual selection of many wireless channels and nothing seems to work
##This router just loses connection for no reason
##Maybe it will work in your area better than mine
##I just know that wireless technology g or n is crap and plugged in still seems the way to go LAN
##It's 2010 and wireless has still got major problems whether with this router or others
##Phil Parker
[t] works as advertised!!! Excellent!
##This is one of the best routers that I have ever owned
port[@]##It was lighning quick with the gigabit LAN port and the set-up was the easiest that I have seen
speed[@]##The range could have been a little better and the wireless thoroughput was a little slower than another wireless N router that I have, but it was still very impressive and besides the numbers I couldn't notice a lack of speed
##It had great compatability with a Hawking N range extender and overall I have was pleased with my purchase
antennas[@][u]##The expandable  is a hube plus
antennas[@][u]##If you need range go for 7 or 9 DBI high gain  and this router has the power to give you what you need
[t] Works great as advertised!
security[@]##Has all the greatest security and is faster for newer 802
##11n products or is backwards compatible with 802
##11a and g products
##Also has four ports that run at 1 gigabit for the newer standards of ethernet
[t] Router Upgrade
##Purchased and installed the D-Link DIR-655 after reading review in PC World mag
##So far with about 30 days of use it has lived up to the very good review it was given
##It met or exceeded my expectations in all areas of wireless router processing attributes
price[@]##Another plus was the excellent price at which I was able to purchase it on Amazon
##com
[t] ok
##great router for the money very fast, reception is fair could be better could be worse
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##It works
##I'm happy with it
##I have not explored all the options
##Software setup was a bit of an issue if you are upgrading from one router to another
##There is a step in the setup where it will continuously hang up
##ignore it
##The router will work regardless
##I realized this after about an hour of setup time when it should have taken 15 minutes

[t] Zero Problems Out Of The Box
##First, I'm not the hot rod geek type
##My previous router was a Net Gear that gave me a fit to get up and running
##Then lasted three yrs
##and crapped out
##I bought the D-Link based on the reviews I read and research telling me an N Type router was more secure
##Anyway, out of the box I followed a few simple written instructions a few prompts on the computer and was rockin' in no time
##I've only had it a couple months but, no issues at all
speed[@]##I use a lap top in my home office three rooms away from the router with no complaints on speed
##Lap Top runs Windows Vista
##Would highly recommend
[t] LOVE IT
##Awesome signal strength in places we were always lacking in our office building, EASY to set up how I wanted it and EASY to get hooked into with my laptop, Could not be more pleased!
[t] Complicated hookup; professional help has problems
##It works as advertised, but instructions and phone help were inadequate
software[@][u]##They don't tell you in the printed instructions that they do not recommend use of Microsoft Connect any longer; D-Link now uses another company  (good ) for the installing the device
##The on-line help didn't know about certain instructions When D-Link person on phone help was questioned about changes spelled out in the inclosed instructions, he was unaware of them
##If I hadn't had a "professional" installing this, it still most likely wouldn't be connected
##The D-Link "help" was very courteous I would like to add
##If you really know what your doing and can "translate" the instuctions and, if needed, get help from a D-Link person who knows all the latest instructions etc, then the product is a good deal
[t] A bit flakey
##I found this router a bit flakey in two repsects
internet[@]##First, I've found that even after it has estabilished a connection with my ISP, I frequently can't access the internet through it
##If I plug my old linksys in, no problems
##It usually happens if I've physically done something with the router
##At first I thought it was the network cable, but after replacing the network cable twice I don't think that's it
##I've found that resetting the router usually gets it back into a good state, but that doesn't leave me feeling very good about the router
##The second thing I've found is that when copying large files (media files > 1 GB) around on the wired LAN, my machines lose connection to one another frequently enough that the copy takes a LONG time to complete due to the network timeout
##I haven't tracked down why this is the case, but it doesn't happen with my 100 MB linksys and it does with this router
##Again, leaves me kind of regretting the purchase
##I will say that I like the config UI and it was really easy to set up
##The wireless has worked flawlessly and the signal is MUCH stronger than from my previous router
##The logging it supports is also much better than anything I've seen in other routers
[t] Tough XP Home installation.
##I'm in IT and I've installed a few networks, so I'm not a novice
installation[@]##This installation took 4 frustating days
##Hopefully I can save someone some heartache
software[@]##The Network Magic software was no help
##D-Link support helped me configure things first time thru the http
[t] Stops working daily
##Do yourself a favor and go look at the CNET reviews as well - I was completely misled by the reviews I saw here on Amazon
##Even with the newest firmware, this router drops the wireless at least once a day and has to be rebooted
##You DON'T WANT THIS ROUTER! I'm seriously surprised they didn't recall it
[t] Did NOT Work for me January 5, 2011
##After reading a lot of the reviews, both negative and positive, I decided to purchase this D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##A lot of the negative reviews warned me NOT TO BUY
##The problem is, that every single wireless router that Amazon sells has a lot of negative and positive reviews
##No matter what router I purchased they all had lots of negative reviews and even more positive reviews
##What's a person to do? A quick back of the envelope calculation of the number of positive vs negative reviews told me that I had about a 70 to 80 per cent chance that any router I purchased would work and a 20 to 30 per cent chance that it would not work
##I live in Las Vegas and throw the dice once in a while so, I decided to gamble that I would be in the 70 per cent that worked
##I lost
##Because of all the negative reviews I was very careful to follow the set up directions to the letter
##I read through all the directions before I even unwrapped the router
internet[@][u]##I made sure that my  connection was working before I even unwrapped the router
##I went step by step through the setup
##IT DID NOT WORK eventhough I followed the directons to the letter
##The only good thing about the entire situation was that I was on hold so long to tech support, that it gave me plenty of time to get more and more upset, think about the next move, make a decision, unhook everything, re-hook up my old router, log on to Amazon
##com, print the Amazon return label, pack up everything, and tape up the box, all before tech support came back online
##Are you feeling lucky?????????
[t] Make sure you update your firmware!
##Before you consider buying this POS router, do yourself a big favor and Google "securespot" and you should have all the info you need to run away from this product
##It's probably the worst technology purchase I've ever made
software[@]##I'm a software developer and I consider myself to be an advanced networking guru
##Frankly I'm ashamed I didn't properly research this purchase myself
##There is a "feature" on this router's firmware called "securespot" that is a sad attempt for novice users to manage their network via an online service
##Fortunately you can disable this feature you ask
##Well, yes in fact you can
internet[@]##that is until it randomly decides to turn itself back on every couple days effectively turning off your internet connection
##Once you realize your connection is down, you'll need to log into your router
##Of course the router shows that securespot is disabled so you have to re-enable securespot, save, disable securespot, save and like magic your connection returns
##at least for another 48 hours until you have to repeat the process all over again
##As soon as I procure a suitable replacement I plan to take this piece of junk out back with a baseball bat, blare some Geto Boys ([
##]) and Office Space this sucker into a million pieces
##****** UPDATEFortunately D-Link saw the error of their ways and release new firmware completely eliminating the entire "securespot" feature
##Make sure you update your firmware to the very latest
##Since updating the firmware I haven't had to reset the router in months
##I've changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars
[t] caution##I loved this router until I got an Iphone
##There was some sort of glitch
[t] no better than a cheaper model
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless RouterI bought this router to replace a cheaper Linksys router
##Unfortunately it didn't increase the signal strength and it kept fading in and out
##I went back to my Linksys and returned this router
[t] D-Link DIR-655 N+300 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router
##Works great
price[@]##Good price
##If you want more than this you are not getting any review from us at all
[t] Best Router I've Ever Owned!
##Here is a layman's description of this great router
[t] Up and Running - Noticeable Speed Improvement!
##First impression
[t] No Issues
##This router seems to do it's job well
##I was having trouble with my old router with online gaming while my wife was online with the computer, but this router solved that problem
streaming[@]##No lag even if she is watching streaming video at the same time
##I have a desktop a laptop and my xbox 360 all connected wireless
##Good product
[t] Very good
##good product, I've been using this product for 1 month - so far no problems
##Speed is 132 Kbs on first floor, router location is on 2nd floor
[t] Excellent purchase
##Easy to set up, and blindingly fast throughput! I'm very happy with this router
[t] D-link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##Excelent product
##Very good range
##Can use up to 300 ft away' no problems with walls etc
[t] It worked much better than expected!
##My last router was a Linksys WRT150N and I was very disappointed with its performance
##It didn't function well at range
##However, my last D-link router was the most temperamental router ever, but because good reviews I bought the DIR-655 and have been very happy with it
##It's range is fantastic (not to mention all the other good features that I expect out of a router
##) A computer that was about 50 yards away went from weak signal with the Linksys to Excellent with the DIR-655
[t] Excellent
##Excellant product
##Easy to install and set up
##Works great
##Reaches throughout the house, all rooms upstairs and down
##Excellant for browsing and gaming
[t] Router works well. USB over Ethernet does not.
##I bought this "premium" router both its N-ness and the USB-over-ethernet capability
##The router works well
##Features are easy to setup via its browser user interface
speed[@][u]##I am satisfied with the 
##However, I am not happy with the network USB
##Its performance is terrible
speed[@][u]##On a gigabit wired network I get a  of only 3 MB/s when using a 500 GB USB external hard drive on the network USB
##On the other hand, the same hard drive plugged directly into the PC gives a throughput of 30 MB/s
speed[@]##Overall, the router is expensive for what it provides if you consider the network USB feature as useless because of its pitiful speed
##Back to the drawing board D-Link
[t] D-Link DIR-655 review
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless RouterVery satisfied with the performance this N+ router once it was set up with proper encryption (WPA2)
##The only negatives have to do with the D-Link support staff
##All my inquires were met with a regurgitation of information from the support site
##If the answer to my questions were on the site I would not have needed to contact them
##Recommend the product but only to those who are familiar with the requirements for proper setup
[t] Works perfectly
##I was worried about using the wizard to set-up the router, but it worked fine
##I did not have to do any manual adjustments
##The range of the router is better than my old Linksys
speed[@]##The wireless speed is fine, but I had hoped that my laptop would be able to use "N" instead of "G"
##I only have a "G" type connection for some reason, and maybe my quite new laptop does not support "N"
speed[@][u]##The connection  is fine for my uses, and I have not bothered trying to figure out if the laptop supports "N"
##I get 1000 MBPS on my ethernet network using fairly short cat5 cables
speed[@]##This is a very nice speed bump from 100 MBPS
##Now lets hope the router continues to work well for a long time
[t] Sporadic, Weak Coverage
##The D-Link DIR-655 does not work as advertised
##As a person who works for a technology manufacturer (not a competitive product), I can guarantee you'll be disappointed in this router
##I did my research after my Belkin pre-N router died, and this one seemed like the best choice
##After a quick & easy set up, it worked fine for the first 5 minutes
##Then I noticed all 3 laptops getting sporadic covereage & the range wasn't very good
##I also use a IP VPN phone at home for work, this direct connection also didn't work
##I'd highly recommend not purchasing this product, as having to go through the return process only frustrates dealing with a poor product
##I did purchase a Linksys WRT160N (N ultra rangeplus), everything now works great
##Good luck
[t] Apple Users Left Behind
##The USB feature is NOT supported for apple computers
##everything else is OK, but 1 missing feature is a huge bummer
[t] to D-link from linksys
port[@]##Just replaced my linksys router and wireless access port with the D-Link DIR-655
##So far working great
##The setup was ultra easy
##I've had many linksys products but they always degrade or just stop
##The most I've gotten was three years, which isn't bad but the reviews were great for the D link
##So far so good with the D link
##UPDATE
##It's 10-26 2012 and the D-link is still going strong with no problems
[t] Very mitigated
##First of all, I'd suggest not to use the wizard provided for Windows
##Didn't work for me
##What was supposed to be a breeze and 10 minutes setup with the wizard, ended up taking in reality much longer
##I recommend personally to hit the web interface directly
##Although I was pleased with the Ethernet 1Gbit connectivity, and the direct close wireless access 802n connectivity with my MacBook pro, that was a totally different ball game when crossing 2 walls
##My windows XP laptop would drop connections all the time
##My old NetGear never had that issue, which really irritated me
##Took me multiple tweaks and resets from both the router and the laptop sides, and maybe a week of disgruntled googling to get it right
##I think that the orientation of the laptop itself (a Compaq 6510b) made a great difference
##Although negotiating 802g only, it's finally very stable
##Was very critical for me to get this working since I'm using VPN for work, and communication drops were more than just annoying
##I was about to return the item to Amazon when I finally got things right
##Since I got a great deal on this device, I am planning to keep it
##Not sure I would go for this product if I had known in advance that the communication through walls could be such a problem
[t] Too much effort...
##I bought this product to replace a linksys router because I was trying to get better coverage in my house
##Dlink claimed wider and faster coverage but I discovered the coverage at best was only as good as my older and cheaper linksys router
##I ended up keeping the linksys and purchasing a 100feet of cat5 cable and hardwiring the two routers and placing them in different places in the house
##Once I had done this I found the Dell wireless card could not pick up the secured dlink router and had to go out an purchase a new dlink wireless card for the desktop
##I had my ISP provider try and get the connectivity and this was our only solution to get the coverage
##not really as straighforward and simple as advertised
[t] Great, reliable product with all the features you'd want
##I bought the DIR-655 on an advice from a friend and was not disappointed one bit
##It's been over a month since I got it and I've had no issues with it whatsoever
##Configuration process was easy
##Advanced features are easy to access and can allow for some great modifications
##Data transfer performance is good
##Wireless range is great, I get reception everywhere in the house and backyard (unit is in upstairs office on opposite side of house)
##Great buy you will not regret
[t] Very Satifistied much better than Linksys
##I have using this product for past 2 months and extremely happy
##Very easy setup procedure
##I have used Linksys 802
##11G router in past, it used to work fine but there were lot of dropped connection and i have reboot my router every 6-7 days
##I wondered it may be natural until i bought this one
##And believe me this has been amazing experience
##Never once my Skype Phone (CIT400) has dropped connection
##I still have wireless G which appears to perform at least 1
##5 times faster than earlier router
##I am thinking to buying 802
##11N (draft) adapter to realize full potential of this router
##It is highly recommended to buy this one
##Cons
[t] Not for the non techie
##I bought this router to replace my Belkin-G router
##Just wanted something faster
##The reviews were great all over the net
##The features sound fantastic but none of that matters if you can't get the darn thing to work
##I am not a techie
##I want to plug and go
installation[@][u]##I can follow the  instructions given by most install wizards
##If I have to go to the manual to install, that's a red flag for me
##I could not get this router to recognize my SBC dsl connection for anything
internet[@][u]##My belkin ( and previously netgear) routers recognize my SBC  just fine
##No fuss or muss
##I am sure with tweaking and futzing this thing would have worked
##Tech support wanted me to turn off firewall, check DNS IP and download updates
##Way too much involvement for me
##I'll go look for a netgear or belkin N-router
[t] Great router but...
##I just bought this router to replace my old and faithful 100mbs linksys and to take full advantage of my new HP MediaSmart EX470 (great product btw)
internet[@],installation[@]##The installation process went very smoothly, as simple as it could be (you need a working internet connection though)
software[@]##The router's software is easy to use, very clear and full of nice details (like it will d/l the right firmware by itself, making future updates as un-stressful as possible, etc
software[@]##)BUT, and it is a big but, do not install the extra software
##NetworkMagic, as it is named, made my network so slow (I was kind of hoping the opposite) that I thought of a virus
##Remove it and you're back to normal
software[@][u]##Since the D-Link  works perfectly well, I don't really see the point of installing this crappy addition, even if it comes free
##It could be some incompatibility with Windows Home Server but I will not bother to test that possibility
[t] Excellent router
##Our old router was not compatible with our new HP Windows 7 desktop unit
##We simply plugged this one in and it worked fine
##I found it a little difficult to figure out how to enter a password on the setup screen--they used terminology that was confusing
##But once I figured it out, it works fine,
[t] Easy wireless
##I have a Dell computer with vista 64 - so I carefully chose the router to buy to insure it was compatible
##This was easy to install and although it did take 2 tries (I am not a computer genius) it works fine now - no complaints!
[t] Happy so far
speed[@]##I've had the unit operational for three weeks now and have been very pleased with it's ease of setup, connectivity, and speed
##I have used D-Link products for many years now and have been very satisfied
[t] Have only had problems and problems since I got the router less than a month ago
##I got this router a month ago because it looked to have what I needed
##It worked well for two weeks and then crapped out on me
##I was on the phone with DLink support for 3 hours to have them walk me through upgrading the firmware and reconfiguring the router
##All seemed well until another two weeks when it crapped out again
##I tried calling support and they walked me through the same thing
##I got so frustrated and its no longer worth my time so I threw it out
##Back to Linksys
[t] Amazing
##I run 2 laptops and X Box 360, PS 3, and WII plus the desktop all off this router which is on the 2nd floor of the house
##the signal is ALWAYS excellent
##This router is top notch
##Also, got it for $10 cheaper at amazon than at [
##]
##best router $100 can buy
[t] Excellent device
##Absolutely no problems at all
##Lightning speed, not one drop off since installed 3 months ago
##Setup was easy
##Looks cool too! Highly recommend
##Extremely happy
[t] KICKING... with none of the other reviewers problems.
##Very easy set-up, I was up and running in about 15 minutes
streaming[@]##It's been up and running for three days now - with no overheating, or drop-outs! I was streaming videos from about 75 feet away with no lag
##Not working this weekend so, I'll see how far I can go and will up date
port[@]##I was slightly disappointed with the USB port
##Connected my printer and thought it would act as a networked printer
##No, you have to virtually disconnect the printer from one machine to use it on another
##I would highly recommend this product to a friend!UPDATE
[t] Great router.
##In my 2 story home, with this router in the upstairs office, I get full bars throughout my home
speed[@]##The speed is unbelievable coming from wireless g
security[@]##Easy to setup, good security
##I haven't tested the USB function yet

##Gave it a five
##Replaced an older 100Mb router
##Everything on the net sync'ed right up
##Haven't had to call for support, etc
speed[@]##Great speed
##Wish it had 8 ports though
[t] Worked, until updating to 2.10NA
##The product works perfectly out of the box
##When the update 2
##10NA came out, it caused it to report DNS server not found
##When you check the logs on the product it says ' /rootdesc
##xml not found, responding ERROR 404 ' multiple times an hour and websites appear to have loaded incorrectly at times
##In my case, I called dlink and they sent me a replacement
[t] D-Link
##The D-Link is working fine for us
##We have four computers hooked into it and my son-in-law does mostly gaming on his pc
##I'm satisfied with it
[t] Great router
##I get excellent range, and very good performance out of this router
##I was able to set it up as an access point without too much trouble
##Has a ton of features and the interface is fairly easy to use for configuration
[t] Good if you don't touch it
port[@]##When applying changes to the port forwarding and other types of settings like that, it forces you to go through a 30 second reboot
##Quite annoying when working with it
##The latest firmware I applied failed, and bricked my router
##Dlink support told me to go buy a new one since I was out of warranty
##I could understand if it just died one day, but it was the firware's fault that it bricked, and I get stuck with the bill
##When it did work, it was great
##Good performance, good wireless signals etc
##I will be buying an Asus instead for the replacement
[t] Highly recommend!!!
##I have been using this router for almost one year
##It works pretty well
##But sometimes, it will be disconnected
##I am not sure is it the router problem or the modem's
[t] Router not working
internet[@]##It Keeps dropping internet connections
internet[@]##Cannot use router when connected to computer, because computer cannot connect to the internet
##Called cutomer assistance in Oct
##,(2 weeks after I bought it) and in Dec
##Router tested faulty
##Amazon's warrenty has just expired
##so now waiting for D-link to send a replacement
##Really a bummer not having a router when you need one
[t] Well...
##It worked great for a year or so, but when I done the required firmware upgrade, all I was left with was a white paperweight
[t] Rout It Right!
##This was my first router
##I did a little research on the net and this router rated very high
##Very simple install and performance has not disapointed me
##Would purchase it again!
[t] Top quality products 100% recommended, very good product, 100% quality
##Excellent product I recommend it 100% top quality it always guaranteed gacalidad can buy with confidence for this place satisfied with the good product recommended
[t] Great Router!
##I love this thing! I usually get Linksys (now Cisco) wireless routers
##I liked all I read about this one so wanted to try it out
##One of the best buys I've done! I will buy more D-link gear in the future
##I really Like it!Thumbs up
[t] Works great
##This was easy to set up
##I had no problems
##It shipped quickly
##I am very pleased so far
price[@]##Great value for the price
[t] Very Disappointed
##I purchased this router exited that I would receive a top of the line router for only 70 dollars
##The set up was easy, and it has flying fast speeds
##But now a week later after, replacing all wires, unplugging both the modem and router, resetting and reinstalling, my connection is still being lost and websites are still refusing to load
##The wireless strength is incredible, but lacks connection
##There are 3 wireless devices in my 2/2, and one 360 hard wired to the router, all of which cannot hold a connection
##Needless to say I am disappointed and will be replacing this router
[t] 18-24 Months then Kaput!
##Router worked wonderfully for the warranty period then started randomly dropping Wireless Support
##Not worth the money
##will stick with a Netgear or Linksys next time
[t] Top notch
software[@]##After over 5 years, it is a lot better machine than Linksys, and no problems except with the network software included with it, and which was made by Cisco's Linksys
##I advise not loading that part of the software; the inherent D-Link application is fine by itself
[t] Great home router
##This router is a very well priced robust router
##It runs very well and rarely locks up like my old router
##I highly suggest this router
##If you own an iPad i would suggest setting a reserved IP so the iPad connects immediately to that IP
[t] Great Router - USB Useless
##If you are looking for a router with USB to attach a network drive or printer, THIS IS NOT THE UNIT YOU WANT
software[@],port[@][u]##This unit uses a software called Share to control their USB 
##I wanted a network drive so my wife and I could both share files, but Shareport only allows one person at a time to have access (connect) and before the other can access the drive the first person must "release" it
##It works the same way for printers, and is a pain if someone forgets to release
##I tried a Netgear and its USB attached drive looked like a true network drive that anyone on the home network could access
##However with the Netgear you had to be real close to the router for the wireless to work
##This DLink does provide a great wireless signal throughout the house and seems to be doing an OK job as a router
software[@][u]##I decided I would just use the Shareport network drive for backups, but found out that the driver for their Shareport loads for each individual user, and if like most people your computer logs you off due to inactivity, Shareport no longer works so your backup  cannot find the Shareport drive
##The DLink requires a separate modem which I don't really like
##The Actiontec I was using is an "all in one" but it is an 11g technology
##The DLink is 11n, which is suppose to be faster, but I don't see any difference
##And since I've loaded the Sharepoint drivers I'm seeing a hesitation in all the computers
software[@],installation[@]##The DLink installation software kept locking up, so plan on setting the router up manually
port[@]##All in all, knowing the USB port is useless, once again I find myself wishing I had bought the new Actiontec
[t] No huge jump in speed, but an improvement in range.
##Not the easiest router to set up
##I tried the manual set up on a Mac, no dice
##I used a laptop with a wired connection got the router working after about 4 tries
##Once I disconnected the laptop to go wirelessly, the laptop had a hard time connecting, but success was achieved without calling tech support
[t] Easy and fast
##I deal with IP devices on a daily basis and I would like to say
##This was so easy to set up and use and packed with features
##If it works fine and you don't need a new feature I wouldn't upgrade firmware
software[@]##This is the problem with people they up grade software and firmware just for the sake of up grading
##I love my new DIR655
[t] Wireless router
##It was the best wireless router I ever purchase
##I plan on buying another I can't believe the distance it can go triple AAAAA on this producr
[t] Great product, huge wi-fi capacity vs other products.
##Excellent product with a tremendous wi-fi power connection for a big house and multiple tech products in one place
##This is the perfect router for big families, offices, big houses and anyone who finds his/her self starving for more wi-fi capacity, more gaming and streaming, all at the same time
##The product looks beautiful but the actual image used is not the latest version of the manufactured product
##There's a new version that does not has the light white front panel
##In the new manufactured version the light panel is black and the rest of the stethic is the same, beautiful elegant and strong powered router
##It also included the charger/battery adapter, an adapter converter from AU/HK to US wall adapter and a small black beautiful wall mount to help you save space in your desk, room, family room or office where you can place (wall mount) the router
##I'm in love with it! The shipping took a little bit longer because of some unexpected carrier situation but received such an excelent customer service, and my product arrived/delivered in perfect conditions from Hong Kong, that I just can not complain
##Thanks for such a great product and customer service experience
##This seller just did a GREAT-GREAT job
##Would buy again this brand products as well as from this seller
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##Excellent Router, up and running without a hitch
##Great range and 300 megs
##Wow what performance
[t] Stellar N Router!!! Great Features/Compatibility!!! Poor Setup Software/Support.
##I bought this router after co-workers complained that of VOIP quality problems on my end
##I wanted a router that had QoS, great performance, and wireless N connectivity
##CNET called this router the fastest they'd reviewed at the time, so I decided to order it
##The setup was a little painful
software[@]##I don't respect Network Magic because I owned their flagship software and it never worked as advertised (even after months of support emails)
##Unfortunately, Network Magic developed the setup wizard for the DIR-655 and it shows! True to form, the Network Magic development team botched the process by doing things like requiring an ISP user name/password when my ISP (Comcast) doesn't need one
internet[@],installation[@]##Naturally, entering credentials as required broke my internet connection, and calling D-Link installation support wasn't especially helpful, either
##After reaching the rep with a thick foreign accent, I had to explain the technical ins and outs of a step of the process that more conveniently acheived a task in a way that wasn't what he learned from the script he read from
installation[@][u]##Anyway, after realizing that Network Magic's setup wizard and D-Link  support were both pretty much useless I abandoned them both, hard-reset my router, then set my SSID, wireless security, and router credentials manually
port[@]##Since then, this has been the best router I've owned! In fact, while I expected to have to manually configure port forwarding for my MediaSmart Server (which I did with every other router claiming to support UPnP) and while I expected to have to manually set the priority of traffic from various devices for the QoS settings, in actuality I had to do neither!This router was smart enough to both detect UPnP settings and brilliantly handle QoS in ways that made my old Buffalo Turbo-G router seem like a paperweight! I thought it must be too good to be true, but I confirmed that my devices worked perfectly and that my upstream bandwidth was reserved enough to maintain VOIP call quality during a conferance call, even as I uploaded a 140 MB file to a computer at work!This router has simply amazes me and is certainly on my list of most recommended products, despite the problems with setup/support!Even interaction with my 802
##11n Apple TV is smoother than with my old router, and at N speeds!
[t] Works great so far
##After three replacements of a competitor's router, I decided to switch to a D-Link DIR-655
##So far, this unit has been a huge improvement over the competitor's router
security[@]##It has been very stable and reliable, and the WPA-2 security has worked great with my wireless connections
software[@]##The software is a little intimidating at first, but overall allows much more versatility
[t] Great Hardware
##Easy to configure
##Works great
software[@]##Great software
##Found it cheaper at Walmart though
[t] Awesome!
##It is everything I expected and more
##I did my research on which router to buy and I'm glad to say that it has paid off!!
[t] Perfect after 2nd day
##I replaced my Linksys A+G Wireless router with the D-Link DIR-655 Gigabit Wireless-n router in less than an hour
##My network consists of 2 laptops(wireless-g), a desktop PC(uses wired gigabit), a desktop iMac(uses wireless-n), a wireless printer, a Netgear NAS(wired), and a Vonage VOIP by Linksys(wired)
security[@]##I used 128 bit WEP for security as before with same key as before
installation[@]##Following the instructions carefully and using the supplied CD for installation with its wizard,
##easy
##On each computer, I entered the new family network name and reentered the WEP key
##Then I removed the old router network link
##The Apple iMac flies now with the wireless-n link
internet[@]##Watching downloaded and streamed internet movies on all the computers is something I wanted to see and Wow! An Apple TV wireless-n may be a future purchase now
internet[@]##Even the 2 laptops with wireless-g are snappier on the Comcast cable internet and in using the NAS disk drives now
##I used to only use Linksys network prducts
##I love this D-Link Dir-655 now
##If it hiccups in the coming weeks I will post another review
[t] DIR-655 is VERY FAST and reliable
##Before i ran a WRT300N and it would disconnect all day long, so i upgraded to Dlink DIR-655 and this router is great
##It like having a router with turbo boost power, i haven't lost signal at all, and my signals went up from 2 bars to a full 5 bars
##The Pros
[t] awesome product
##lacks a lot of features, but faster than the zyxel it replaced which was limiting simultaneous connections to the net and forced this new buy
##Other products had storage links to USB drives, which I wished this had because my current SANS drive is limited to 500GB and T100/mb connection
##The connection is so strong that I bumped the signal to low power
[t] No problems here
##I recently purchased the DIR-655 to replace a dying router
##Installation was easy
##I did not use any of the supplied CD's
##Everything set up easily with the network interface and all of my computers connected without issue in g and n
##macs, pc's, my computers, other people's computers
##The file transfer speeds are nice for the N machines and it seems I have more range with this router than the standard G router I had before
internet[@]##Gaming has improved as well while others are using the internet
##I normally would not buy a higher end router such as this, but I received an Amazon coupon from work for Christmas
##I am happy with the purchase and hope this unit lasts a long time
[t] D-Link does it again!
##This is by far the best wireless router I have ever had! First off it is a breeze to set up, just insert the CD that is bundled with it and go! The WPA gets set up and the instructions are first class
##Also the range on this puppy is so long that I can now go to our mailbox which is an easy 500 feet from my house and still have 2 out of the 5 bars on my laptop! I don't know what that one guy was saying but my MacBook works awesomely with this router
speed[@]##The speed is the fastest I have seen, I am pulling down GB's of data in half the time I used to with my Netgear router (802
##11 G)
##Heres a tip
##buy now!
[t] Best Router I've Ever Owned
##The most reliable, expandable and customizable router I have ever worked with
##Having trained on a number of Linksys routers at Cisco Networking Academy, I have come to appreciate this DLink that I have owned for more than a year
##PROS
[t] Router
##I don't know much about technology - but the thing works - and the kids are happy with it
[t] I'm actually impressed with tech support for once!
##I read reviews on the majority of the lower priced N routers out and the overall reviews have been all across the board
##Lots of 5 stars and lots of 1 stars which I always think is kinda weird
##Anyway, for the DIR-655 there were more high ratings than low and most of the low one's sited incompetent tech support
##I figured I'd ignore that because I've never found a company that consistently gives good tech support
##I got the router in about 3 days from when I ordered it and popped the install CD in my computer
##Its really easy to follow although it made me reboot my computer once during the setup
internet[@]##Everything seemed to initiate properly except I could not connect to the internet
##After reading the reviews of the poor tech support I figured I'd call my ISP (Sbcglobal/Yahoo) first
##I sat on hold for about 30 minutes
##After being transferred to 2 different operators who didn't know what to do I reluctantly called D-Link support
##I got thru to an Indian operator in about 30 seconds and explained my problem
##He quickly identified what I was trying to do and very easily walked me thru a couple of settings that I needed to add to the more advanced configuration options
##I was up and running in about 10 mins!I've got my desktop hardwired, 2 laptops and a Blackberry connected thru WIFI and they are all working great!I recommend D-Link and this router to anyone looking to upgrade to a well priced N router!
[t] Works Great!
##Nice router, works great!Let me start by saying that I'm a neophyte network person, in other words, I've never set up a network before
##I bought this to use with a hard wired pc, a wireless laptop and for wireless Xbox 360 live
##The setup was fast and easy using the setup disk
##I know this may not be optimal for all you network geeks, but it works for me
##I'll tweek it if needed as I learn more
##From unboxing to finished setup, it probably took 15 minutes tops
##The reliability has been excellent
##I have never had to restart it in the 3+ weeks I've owned it
##My laptop picked up the signal and works great
##The Xbox 360 has performed great as well, with no noticeable router lag
##FYI- I'm using the Xbox 360 N Wireless Adapter
##The only minor drawback is I have yet to discern an on/off switch
##The on-disc-only documentation doesn't seem to mention it
##At least I haven't found it yet
##I can still turn off the cable modem, but the router stays on
##Also, there's a button on the side of the router that I have yet to discover what it does, no documentation on it either (yet)
##Knowing this now, these issues would not dissuade me from buying it anyway
[t] Great Router
##I've owned this thing for well over a year now and it has been rock solid
speed[@]##Great speed and range
##Best router I have owned
[t] Worth it for gaming
##Bought this to upgrade from a wireless G
##Glad I did
##All three of our computers are connected faster than before
##Played WOW and L4D2 and couldnt be happier
##Low pings easy to setup took maybe 5 minutes out of box and is compatible with Windows 7
##Great router
[t] Delivers as promised.
##I've yet to explore "Security Features" and hence unable to give 5 stars
security[@]##But couple of my friends have used and their experience is good with security as well
##Reliability is still early to say but so far so good & hence 4 stars (bought 3 weeks back)
##Main reason of buying was cost and this had Gigabit ports
##Hope this helps
[t] just got it and LOVE IT!
##Just switched over from a Motorola
##Needed something that would give me wireless outside and this more than does the trick
##Great signal throughout the house and beyond
##Also very fast
##Works well with the Netflix box, Wii, and all of my wireless toys
##Setup was pretty easy
##Didn't have to call for tech support or anything and I'm not a techie, so if I can do it, you should be able to
[t] Switched from Linksys WRT150N to D-Link DIR-655
##My Linksys WRT150N was never really reliable from the get go
##It would constantly drop signal; initially once a month, then once a week a few months later, and then recently several times a day
##Tried several things from updating firmware, to making sure it was sitting so that no vents were covered (noticed it was getting really warm), but it would still drop signal; cable modem was fine
##A recommendation at work led me to the DIR-655 and have never had an issue since
##It has never dropped signal, there was virtually no setup needed, it just worked, the admin page for manual setup took a couple of minutes getting familiar with, but was easily able to set up a secure WPA2-PSK network
##Very happy with this router
[t] Loved this router until I tried to use it
##I read quite a lot of router reviews before deciding on this one
##We live in a highly populated area and our new/current router was having difficulty
##I wanted a different brand and one that could handle interference
##After the recommendation of a friend who also owns this router and the many good reviews, we decided to go with it
##The Good
[t] Exceeded expectations
##Chose this product based on technical and user reviews and was very satisfied with the decision to buy
##Installation went quickly and tech support was available to handle a minor issue with connectivity to Comcast
##Performance is excellent
[t] Piece of Garbage!!!
##After researching and reading all kinds of reviews, I plunged in to buy this router since the 3 laptops in the home are all N-type
##My previous router was Linksys (a true gem for over 7 years) G type
##It's been over 6 weeks since I am using the Dlink DIR-655 router
##As of this week, this router constantly disconnects both the wired and wireless connections
##Happens every 30-40 mins and I am dead in the water for about a 1 min every time
##It automatically disconnects and then connects back
##This problem started only this week
##I have the latest firmware and I have not changed anything else in the set up on either this router or my cable modem
##This is very annoying
##I have rebooted the router and the modem couple of times and still the problem exists
##Why after 6 weeks of use--I don't know
##My previous G-type Linksys router had no issues for many years
##I am ready to just throw this router out and go back to Linksys
##I am definitely staying away from Dlink products
[t] ...
##It is absolutely lovely to be able to go on line anywhere on our property
##Well worth the money
[t] Wireless DIR-655-Exteme N Review
##First, let me point out that up until this product, I was a loyal D-Link customer with excellent past results
##This device, for whatever reason, would not hold it's configuration from day to day
##Every time I rebooted the laptop, the device seemed to reboot as well, and returned to the default settings
##Calls to D-Link support had long waits, and then no explanation
##They reviewed my settings and confirmed that they were correct
##In addition, I have a wireless voice system (AT&T) that started dropping calls
##Again, D-Link support advised to change channel setting to 0, which I tried with the same results
##I spent over two weeks trying to resolve problems and had no success
##I returned the D-Link router and replaced it with a Cisco/Linksys, and it was connected, configured, and has been operational now for two weeks with absolutely no issues
[t] Ended up in the trash after 7 mos
##I admit it worked great when it worked
##I have 4 Netflix devices and it handled them all well
##However it was unstable and constantly required resetting (the wired connection) not the wireless
##My previous US Robotics device worked flawlessly for years
##Phoning D-Links customer support in India resulted in 2 blatant and direct lies
##The reason for phoning was the power supply had a short that rebooted the the router on any slight movement
##It was clearly under warranty as I was looking at the warranty while speaking to the agent YET he insisted the power supply was out of warranty
##When I insisted it was under warranty he changed direction and tried to tell me it would cost more to return than to purchase new
##After I insisted on speaking to a SUPER I finally got an RMA for the cost of postage BUT to be honest-even if they sent a new product, why would I risk the loss of my future effort on a substandard company/product
##Look elsewhere folks
[t] Will never switch from D-Link after this router
##I have a multiple computer/video game family and have tried mutiple routers
##My first router was a lynksis (probably like a million other people) and I had nothing but compatibility issues
##Lynksis support could not help me either by computer or phone
##Next I tried a netlink
##This router died in less than a year and netlink sent me a replacement, that died in less than a year
##At this point I bought my D-Link
##I have not had any problems since the day I hooked it up
##It has been a little over two years since I purchased it
##I recently purchased another D-Link router for my parents
##They had gone through the same progression as me and asked what router I thought they should get
##I did not hesitate to recommend this router to them
price[@][u]##It didn't hurt that Amazon had a great  on it
##Since I installed the router for them they have been nothing but happy
speed[@]##The speed on this router is outstanding
internet[@],speed[@]##If you are running a cable internet connection you definately need a router with gigabit speed
speed[@]##I love that I can specifiy where the speed is directed (for gaming)
##The extended signal area is a huge plus also
##I have a great signal no matter where I am in the house, regardless of walls or doors
##It has four wired ports for close connections and I have had as many as six wireless connections going at once
security[@]##There are three levels of security available, WEP, WPA, WPA2
security[@]##The router allows you to choose your own security password or take a default one
##One thing I like personally is that cisco keeps trying to creep in on D-Link and D-Link keep distancing themselves from cisco
##For that fact alone I would buy, support and recommmend D-Link, even if the router was not as great as it really is
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##I love this router! It was easy for me to set up on my own
##I had it running and had our laptop & Ipod using the wireless within just 20 minutes or less
##It was nice to surprise my husband & already have it hooked up
##(-;
[t] Solid Performer
##I replaced an older D-Link wireless router that continued to lose connectivity and had to be restarted a few times a week
##I'm not sure if it was the router itself or conflicting signals in my neighborhood
##However, once I bought the DIR-655 I haven't had this problem anymore
##It's work solidy without losing connectivity and having to be restarted
##My PS3 is connected wirelessly to it and no longer cuts out either
##So with a PS3, Wii, 4 laptops, smart phone and a desktop in my house, everything works just fine
##It's expensive in comparison to other models but it works and was worth the money
[t] piece of cake
##super easy setup
##I started my new provider, Clear, a couple days earlier and the set up with this router was a dream, highly recommend, have had no issues
##No heat buildup as in other reviews
##Maybe they forgot to remove the clear plastic wrap from vent area
[t] Easy Setup. No compatibility issues.
##Installed quickly
##Removed old router and put the new one in place
##A network printer that frequently caused problems with the old router worked as soon as it was connected and continues to do so
##Very happy with this item
[t] Love this router
##This router has been performing really well
##With my old G router, I had a dead spot in my bedroom
##With this router, it has disappeared and my reception all over the house is great
[t] Printer USB port does not work
##I too had difficulity setting up the product
##The "quick start" CD did not work
##After several attempts I got the unit to work using the manual configuration
##When I tried to access other computers on the wireless I could not "see" any other computer
##The Tech said "Call Microsoft" and hung up
##Another call found a girl that finally helped me by pointing me to the networking feature of Windows 7
##I finally got the system to "see" other computers by generating a Home network
##I put my Brothers HL-5230 laser printer on the Dlink and it would not print correctly and only printed the 1st 5 lines
##After several calls to tech support I upgraded the Share Port software, another call to tech support resulted in upgrading the firmware in the DIR-655 which of course reset all the previously input settings
##Another call to tech support got that problem fixed but the printer still didn't work
##The level 2 tech suggested I download the latest printer driver
##I did and the Dlink printer still doesn't work
##Another call and tech support said I needed a network version of the driver
##When you connect a printer the Dlink loads a seperate driver onto your laptop so now you have 2 printer driver, neither of which work! I am taking the product back
##If I can't trust the printer to work correctly how could I ever trust the Dlink working correctly with an external disc drive? I spent over 8 hours and 6 phone calls and it still doesn't work! No more Dlink products for me
[t] No problems, love it
##I have ATT UVerse, no problem at all (and I mean none) with the install
##I read all of the 1 star reviews and I have none of the issues listed there
##I spent an extra 2 days reviewing routers after reading all the negatives about this router but after reading more than 100 different products descriptions I decided on the D-Link and I have no regrets
##It has performed exactly like I wanted, great product
[t] Good quality product.
##Nice product
##Easy to install
##Customization through D-Link SW is very dynamic
##Good for experienced person
##Might be intimidating for a novice
##Configuration issues really only experienced with networking PCs that had different OS's (Vista vs 7)
##Takes some finesse
##Reliability solid
##Overall very happy
[t] Way Better Than Cisco Routers
##I bought a Panasonic TV in June
##It has Internet access
##I was never able to get it to connect to the Internet
##I replaced one Cisco router with another
##I called Cisco tech support
##Awful
##I bought the D Link router and had it up and running in ten minutes
##I'll never buy another Cisco product
[t] solid N router, runs warm, great control over your network
##got this in 2008 and has never given me problems
price[@]##price has gone down in 2011, but still no issues for me
[t] Good range, has guest access
##The main reason for this purchase was for the guest network/ access
##This allows me to set it up as a Hot Spot
internet[@]##The devices connected to the guest network are on VLANs, allowing them to see only the internet
##This guest network is in addition to the main network that works normally
##This router also allows for schedules to be setup
##The main network can be up at all times while the guest network is only on during business hours
security[@]##You can also setup different security settings on the two wireless networks
[t] Worked as planned
##Bought this to upgrade from my DI-604 wired unit
##I'm old school and like wired connections so have not turned on the wireless yet
port[@]##My newer PC has the gigabit port already
##Not really interested in super speed, just reliability
##Whenever Comcast upgrades to DOCSIS 3 I'm ready
##No regrets on this purchase
[t] good but not great
##The configuration tools aren't as polished as linksys but once you get it up and running it works
##It's been two months and I haven't had to even think about it, it's just sitting on the shelf doing what it's supposed to do
[t] Extreme Performance Without Extreme Costs
##Setup was fairly easy
##I could not get the setup disk to work in W7 with Spyware Doctor and MS Security Essentials, but manually going in with the IP, there were Auto Programs for Wireless and Internet setups
##The Share Port feature is nice to allow other systems to access USB Devices such as a Printer or External Hard Drive
##I've had a few issues of disconnect and had to reboot the router
antennas[@][u]##Range and signal are fine with the triple 
##If you want a good router and not many hassles with setup, decent tech support, D-Link is fine
##I've had setup several Netgear routers, G's and N's, and this was easier to setup other than the Disk Issue
[t] It is ok
##The router came in the time requested
##Upon opening the package the CD rom was warped and did not work in the drive
##Fortunately the instructions had the website address to access the needed informaiton
##The router is satisfactory, but provides me no more coverage than the netgear WGR614v7 it replaced
##The only reason for purchasing this model was the expected increase in range
##As far as reliability it sometimes has to be rebooted
[t] dir-655 lasted 22 days
##Worked great for 22 days, then i wasn't able to connect wirelessly
##Tried resetting the unit with no luck
##Called support and after 45 minutes on the phone, I was told the until was defective and I needed to send it back for a refund
[t] Works great!
##I went back to a cable modem so I needed it wifi
##I do know something about setting everything up and it was a breeze! Reception is great! Can even pick up a good signal in my parking lot! Very pleased
##Only negative is that I occasionally have to put in my WAP code again on my Mac, but other than that not a problem! (Have the same issue with the wifi at work
##Could be a Mac thing
##)
[t] Worked well for 3 weeks
##Worked very well for 3 weeks, then all the lights went out and there was a burning smell
##I noticed that the plastic case started melting on top! After spending 45 minutes on the phone with tech support (India, I presume), they finally arranged to ship me a new one
##I'd rather have had another model, who knows if this one won't burn as well
[t] Worked great for a month!
speed[@]##Product worked great, easy to set up, great speed and then about a month later it stopped working
##Tech support is non-existent
##Their site warns you not to try to return the product to them, deal with the retailer where you purchased the product
##This in an indication to me that there are other unhappy customers who didn't get satisfaction from d-link
[t] Works Perfect!
##I'm using Comcast internet, a PC, and 2 Mac's
##The router was easy to set up, and works with my equipment! The only trouble I had was securing the wireless connection
##After a little research through Google, I found the setting I needed to configure in the router menu
##The wording didn't sound like it was meant
##Other than that, this is a super product!
[t] DIR-655
##Only had this router for a week
speed[@]##easy to setup, speed is great, and it's been much more reliable than our other two year old router
price[@]##Shipping was fast and price was good
[t] Disappointed
##I chose this item for the USB wireless printing--does not work
##The customer service is not helpful and very frustrating
##Would not recommend
[t] Excellent router, robust and reliable.
##Excellent router, robust and reliable
##I have bought it for my cable modem, and to use it for my wireless and "wirefull" networks
##The setup is a bit lengthy, but instructions are very clear
##Another point is the presence of the three antennas, which kind of restricts the space where you can place it
antennas[@][u]##However, the  highly improve the network coverage (6x farther range) compared to other routers with no 
##Also, the 802
##11n technology is so much faster (14x more)
price[@]##The value and features (speed, range, and network share) for its price is excellent, and one of the best out there in the market
##I definitely recommend this product!
[t] Great for media serving
##I replaced my DIR 615 with this DIR - 655 Gigabit router
streaming[@][u]##I was having trouble  HD movies/files from my media server through wireless in conjunction with the Wireless bridge (D-Link DAP-1522) and other N adapters
##To fix the instability issues prior to replacing the DIR-615 with the 655 I hooked up a more stable powerline network adapter (WD Livewire) to the router
##This setup worked great with the WD Live plus media players for 720P HD files but not with the 1080p files
##The Gigabit LAN connection on the DIR-655 fixed that
##FYI the DIR-615 s LAN is only 10/100 Mbps like all non gigabit routers
##The max for the Livewire is 200 Mbps
##1080p is no problem with the D-Link DIR-655 and the WD Livewire
##They work beautiful together
streaming[@][u]##"But wait! My problems with  HD to Wi-fi laptops were fixed too
##My HP HD7 laptop played excellent with its 17" screen
##Not only that, but my HP mini netbook (with an 16GB solid state HD) is now playing HD media files, including 1080P
##WOW! It had a little help by installing a D-link DWA-131 (see my review) usb wireless N adapter
streaming[@]##Now I'm streaming to a laptop not designed for HD media, through walls and closed doors on the other side of the house
##On the Netbook's connection status info, it displays 65 Mbps
speed[@]##Although, I check the transfer rate on the router interface's wireless status, and it displays that the connection speed is 130 Mbps
##That makes more sense for the 1080P files to play on a netbook
##And that sounds good to me
streaming[@]##It seemed to fix most of my complaints I had with the streaming problem, except for its use with the Wireless bridge (D-link DAP-1522)
streaming[@]##The DAP-1522 still has choppiness with streaming to these same laptops
##The DIR-655 was supposed pair well with the DAP-1522, but it doesn't
##That might be a testament to the DAP-1522 more so to the DIR-655
##Maybe I'll get rid of the DAP-1522
##Also, I could not get the USB shareport to work well with my network printer
##Always prints only half the page
##If anyone knows how to fix this, let me know
##Otherwise, I recommend this product
[t] Works fantastic!
##I purchased this a couple of months ago
##Shipped extremely fast
##I set it up within 10 minutes
##I had never set up a wireless router before so I was greatful for the tutorials
##Very easy! Very reliable
##It does not get hot at all
##There is a stand that comes with it where you can put it on its side for air circulation
##I am very pleased with this item and highly recommend
[t] wireless router
##It was easy to install and it has been and continues to be 100% reliable
##I am very pleased with this product
[t] Feature rich router
##First of all, there are a lot of reviews listing features, so I'm not going to list them all
##It has a lot of nice features, more than most need, but as needs change its nice to have
##One suggestion for anyone, visit the manufactruers site, for this or any router
##I did so and read the manual fisrt, it gives more inforamtion than any review or online sale page
##This way you know exactly what features you will get (or not) and what will be required in setup before you buy
##Also dlink has a nice forum, I checked that out to to be sure this thing was not a dud with lots of failures reported
##{Edit}Review for Hardware version A4 - Purchase August 22 2009{Edit}I replaced a previous dlink model WBR-2310 that after two years of perfect operation began to lock up totally
##I choose the same model but the second one had poor connectivity, even on wired
##My computers keep saying the cable was unplugged and then re-connected
##That second one also dropped wireless and reported one of my connections at half-duplex on the same cable that worked fine for over two years
##So I decided it was time to upgrade to something newer
##At the time I bought the first router I only had wireless-G and 100Mbps computers
##Since then I've gotten newer items
##My computers and my PS3's all now have gigabit
##I also have a netbook with wireless-N and a LD blu-ray player with wireless-N
##I choose this model because it could replace not only my old router but also a gigibit switch all in one box
##Without changing any settings in my computers, and even switching back to the cable the other router did not like, everything is running smoothly again thru this router
##Setup was a breeze taking less than an hour to go thru and set everything from scratch
##I used the same IPs and wireless names I had assigned in my other router, and once put in all my items are back online smoothly
##Setup was much easier
##One nice thing over the 2310 is that when entering DHCP reservations, you don't need to reboot, waiting 25 seconds, each time
##There is a reboot later option, so you can enter all the reservations more quickly and then do one reboot after the last one, that saved me 13 minutes of waiting
##The display is nice, as it sorts the connected computers by ip
##It does not however sort the reservations listing, they remain in the order entered
##It would be nice if they were sorted by name or ip making it easier to review what has been enetered, but that is only a small drawback
##I enter them once and rarley go back to look at them
##But when performing cleaup to get rid of old devices it would help if they were easier to find
##A bonus was the guest wireless zone
##This is like having two wireless routers in one
##I was able to set this up, still secure, so I can all guests access
##It is isolated from my connection so the guests can't get into my computers
##Very nice feature
##The only drawback is you can't have the guest zone have hidden ssid and if you use mac filtering, you need to turn if off or put in the mac id when you have guests
internet[@]##I set this up so my house-mate can have internet access and don't have to worry about him having access to my sensative data
##It has good wireless range
##I have it set to medium power and get 65MBps connection inside the house, when I go out on the front porch about 35 feet away, and thru one wall and one set of windows, I still get 56-65MBps and very good signal, 4 out of 5 bars still with the router on medium power
speed[@]##If I walk another 30-40 feet away the signal drops and the speed dropped to only 23Mbps, but I don't plan on using my netbook sitting almost in the road
##I image it would be great if I had it on full power
##My house-mate was able to connect at 65Mbps, where he preiviously was at 11Mpbs on another wireless system
##He should now have coverage in his room, which is directly below mine, where before he mostly got no coverage there and had to come upstairs to the dining room to get coverage, on good days
##I stream a lot of netflix either to my blu-ray or netbook and the qaulity has been great since the upgrade
antennas[@][u]##I suppose the three  help with this, especially since they recommend you put them at different angles, not all three lined up the same way
##{Edit}I Got even better performance by selection a set channel, instead of autoscan, and setting the channel width from 20 to 'auto 20/40'
speed[@]##My netbook connection speed increased from 65MBps to 135MBps
##{Edit}I don't know what happens when you mix wireless-G and wireless-N, so far i've got 3 wireless-N devices hooked to it, but I do have some other wireless-G items I use occasionally
port[@]##There is a usb port which can be used for a shared printer or to use for a usb thumb bdrive to restore settings
##Read the manual for that
##Nice feature but I recently bought a wireless printer
##I guess usb would be faster hookup but then the printer has to be near the router
##I'm waiting for the ink supply to run out of my older printer, which since I don't print much is taking longer than expected then I think I'll switch to the wireless printer
port[@]##But that port can also replace a wireless print server box I had gotten
##So this is really 4 devices (wireless router,guest router,gigabit switch,print server) in one box with one power supply
##It also supports 'green' where it uses lower power with shorter cables to computers and shuts off unused ports
##You can even schedule times to turn the wireless network off, like when you are normally asleep or during work day hours to save power
##Someone mentioned the router overheating, no problem here
streaming[@]##Even after streaming for hours
##Although I have mine in a very well ventilated spot
##I took the stand, flipped it upside down and it fits on the top edge of my lcd monitor, then the router sits on the actual bottom of the stand
##There is not a lot of heat from the lcd and this allows good air flow thru the bottom of the router where the vent is near the front and out the top
##I had my other router there over two years without problem
##Plus it keep the lights within good viewing range and the hole thing out of the way
##I used the stands from the old routers to hold other small items up there, like a portable slimline dvd and a usb hub
##I do agree the blue lights are too bright, even in the daytime
##I have other blue light items so the blue color is not a problem, but these seems so bright, you can hardly make out the shape they are illuminating
##A trick to reduce glow is tape a piece of white papar cut to size over them, it cuts the brightness down but you can still see if they are on thru the paper
##Overall I'm very pleased with this model
##Most of the defaults had this working out of the box with little effort or time, it was only the customizing that took a little time, but was very easy
[t] Great!!
##Have had for a week and works great
##Was intimidated about setting up but was a breeze
##I did have trouble with computer reading setup disc but got it to read even though you can go online and setup
##I had to call dLink helpdesk because of a setup loop I got myself into and they quickly got me set up and running
##Overall, it was easy to set up, it's fast, and I'm completely satisfied
[t] excellent price performance
##Replaced my old Linksys that died with this slick looking D-Link device
##Works extremely well in my home network
##Desktop computer is connected wirelessly with my two printers, scanner and Magicjack connected to the desktop
##I work on my laptop and send documents via the D-Link to the printer via the desktop
speed[@]##Wireless connect speed is always 54mps, the maximum the desktop wireless card can handle
##Security looks pretty tight
##Magicjack VIOP works well via the wireless connection and cordless phones throughout the house
##Backups from my laptop to desktop just fly now
##You can be overwhelmed with the number of setup options, I have never seen so many options for a home network
##Keep it simple
##Technical support sounded Indian, some communications problems with the support tech but she was able to walk my through correcting a problem I had within five minutes
port[@]##Only issue I came across is that printing documents through the network using the parallel port cable from the desktop no longer works forcing me to connect using a USB cable
##Directly printing using the parallel cable from the desktop works fine
##Might be a technology issue but was easily fixed by just changing over to a USB printer cable
##So far so good!
[t] Best home or home office router
##D-Link Wireless N Gigabit Router DIR-655 - Wireless router + 4-port switch - EN, Fast EN, Gigabit EN, 802
##11b, 802
##11g, 802
##11n (draft)In the past, we have used Linksys routers
##The life expectancy of a Linksys seemed to be 1-2 years
##We also experienced random connection issues with the cable modem where we would need to power everything off and restart
##In July 2008 we installed a DIR-655 to replace our 4th Linksys
##Since then we have not had a single problem
##There are no more random reboots or power off restarts required
##This is the best home/office router we have ever used
##PROS
[t] I have bought and installed Several of these....
##This is the BEST, and ONLY wireless router you should buy
##After NIGHTMARES with Netgear N wireless routers, and Tons of problems with Linksys, I tried on of these
##Boy, it is like DAY and NIGHT! First the Netgear Wireless (which use to be good) is now TOTAL JUNK, put your wireless netgear in the garbage
##Also, Linksys is very bad too
##This Wireless router performed exellent in a variety of areas, with a variety of network cards
##Don't like like a Newbie and buy a netgear or linksys, look like a genius when you buy this 655
speed[@]##The speed is incredible through this thing, although my main concern was connectivity
##Flawless all around, works with ever environment, and every card I threw at it
##Works through walls
##This is the new Defacto brand to buy, don't buy anything else but this router
##As a matter of a fact, don't even buy newer models of the D-Link unless they have reviews like this one! I used to HATE wireless until I bought this router, because I was tired of getting all the phone calls from employees who couldnt connect to our servers
##Problem is solved now, never any calls, never any drops
##Speed is INCREDIBLE! Highly Recommended!
[t] Very good router (but you need to set it up right)
price[@]##Pros -This router offers great features/performance for its price
port[@]##It has very good QOS settings, secondary guest SSID, a hardware AES encoder/decoder, great routing performance, a USB port for sharing printers/drives/3G modems [not a true NAS though]
##You can also get very good performance IF you configure it properly
##I have my desktops hardwired (GigE) and my Laptop (ThinkPad x200 Tablet w/ Intel 5100 WLAN) on wireless
##Using WPA2 encryption, 802
##11N, and 40MHz width I get 111Mbps receive and 83Mbps transmit of REAL THROUGHPUT (this is very very good)
##Cons -2
##4GHz operation only
##As a result you need to tweak settings (40MHz channel width on the router AND your wireless adapter) to get good performance (I was limited to 57
##01/52
##02 Mbps with default settings)
##An active B/G client will kill your N performance
##This is a common problem of 2
##4GHz routers and is something you should be aware of (I think simultaneous dual band routers can avoid this problem)
##Other Thoughts -D-Link claims you need to buy one of their adapters to get 300Mbps throughout (forums
##dlink
##com /index
##php?topic=616
##0)
##This is inaccurate as the newer Intel N adapters do support 40MHz width/300Mbps (although it is disabled by default)
##I have also heard reports of this router running very hot
speed[@]##This may have been true of some early models, but mine runs very cool and stable (even when transferring large video files at maximum speed over GigE/802
##11N)
[t] Good, dependable 802.11n gig router
##I switched over to this D-Link N router with gig ports a few weeks ago and so far I've been happy as I've had a stable connection and the options are relatively good no matter what type of network you want to setup
streaming[@]##I currently have-2 wireless Windows laptops connected,-1 wireless MacBook Pro connected,-2 Windows desktops connected,-1 Mac Mini-3 different network attached storage devices,-1 Belkin Skype WiFi phone,-a netflix streaming device and a-iPhone occasionally connected
##I think its fair to say I have more things connected to the router than the average person and its all working very well
internet[@]##I love the fact that it has the ability to setup a guest SSID which gives them access to the internet wirelessly but doesn't allow them access to any of the NAS devices connected via ethernet (or anything else on the main SSID)
##According to the Small Net Builder website this is one of the faster n wireless routers
##With a WPA TKIP encryption or WEP I would get about 20Mbps, with WPA AES I got about 35Mbps and with a hidden SSID and Mac address filtering but no encryption I get a little over 50Mbps as a solid connection in most area's of the house
speed[@]##Its a little over 2 times faster than the G router, but keep in mind that WEP or WPA TKIP encryption severely compromises your connection speed
##In the back of my house, I can pick up between 11 and 23 different WiFi connections depending on the time of day and this DIR-655 still manages to give a solid connection and I've found a channel that lets me still use the 40Mhz bonded second channel which I think is pretty impressive considering how many networks are competing for space around here
##I don't have any real complaints about the unit
port[@][u]##I do wish they had done something more with that USB  on the back as its a bit of a waste at the minute
##Ideally, I would love to specify some LAN IP addresses to attach to the Guest SSID which would make that feature even more useful and of course the 5GHz band would of been a nice option but they do sell those devices already, this just doesn't have it
##I am happy with it, it does everything a wireless router should do, and does it reliably so far
[t] NOT CHEAP BUT WORTH THE MONEY
##I am not a computer genius so I read as many reviews as possible to help me decide what router to buy
##I was going to use my new laptop on the wireless and my desktop is hard wired
antennas[@]##I knew I needed a router with external antennas for maximum signal
##The D-Link DIR-655 seemed to fit my needs
##Installation took maybe 15 minutes and it has been no trouble at all
##The wireless feature is awesum
##I can even take my laptop out to my detached garage about 100 feet away and have enough signal to bring my Sirius satellite radio page up so I can plug it into my stereo and listen to my favorite rock channel
##If you need a router that has a large signal range then I would look no further than this
[t] Very poor range
##I've had this router for a few years and the range has always been poor
##I can put the laptop on top of the router and it still says I only have 70% signal
##Walk ten fee away to the other side of the room and it's down to 50%
##The transmit power is set to "High" and I'm running the latest firmware available
##I had to purchase the range extender just to get any decent coverage at all and it did not help much but at least we can use laptops in the family room againI can not recommend this router
[t] Better than Netgear
##The Dlink firmware was really buggy out of the box- Network filtering (ability to restrict access by MAC address)--- Any entries that don't match the expected filter crash the whole list--- Filtering worked for LAN MAC's, but didn't work at all for WiFi MAC's- The "Check Online Now for Latest Firmware Version" didn't work
##It told me the 2
##00NA (out of box) version was most current for my router (DIR-655 B1), but after contacting support I found that this was not the case
##Everything seems to work fine after downloading & installing the 2
##03NA firmware
##Here are pros & cons vs
##my old router, a Netgear Rangemax WNR3500
##+ Dlink doesn't experience the DNS lockups the Netgear had (the reason I trashed the Netgear)+ Dlink has a slightly stronger signal throughout my house (2 story, 3000sf)- Dlink reboots slower than the Netgear- Netgear has better MAC filtering support--- Netgear does not limit the number of MAC's to allow on the network (Dlink limited to 24)--- Netgear lets you label the MACs entries for easier debugging--- Netgear uses a seperate list for wired & wireless MAC'sThe MAC filtering limitations on the Dlink really bothers me
##Even after removing the least used devices from the list, I still have 25 in my house
##While that may sound absurd to many, consider that my household has 5 smartphones, 4 iPods, 4 Nintendo DS's, 1 iPad, 1 Kindle, 1 NAS, and 2 network printers connecting before I start adding laptops
##Yes, this household has more people than average (6), but it's not that far above average and kids have a lot of connected devices these days
security[@][u]##I used to allow my kids friends to access wifi in the house by adding them to the list, but now I need to juggle MAC's or loosen up on 
##I don't like that tradeoff
##All that said, the tradeoff is worthwhile for a router with better signal strength and one that doesn't lock-up whenever Comcast's DNS hiccups
##4 stars, and I'll up to 5 if Dlink improves MAC filtering support in a firmware update
[t] Works great, When it is working
##This router works great when it is working
##First it is hard to set up, had to call D-link to get it working, that even took around a hour with them helping, that should have been my warning and to just return it, wish I would have now
##This router has a mind of it's own
##Out of the blue it will just stop sending a signal out, everything you have connected to it wireless has no signal
##All the blue lights are on and it appears to be workig normal
##The only thing you can do to get it to work is unplug it and plug it back in
##It even changed the settings on it's own
##It changed the broadcast name and password on its own
##It even changed the password to the administration to change settings on computer
##I can't remember how many times I had to set this router up and input all the information on the devices connected to it with this router
##If you like messing around and inputting passwords all the time, this is the router for you
##If you prefer to set it up and forget about it, then stay far away from this router
##For me I am staying away from this router and D-Link period
[t] Had this router for 6 years
##Sadly, this router has come to the point of needing replacement after 6 years of faithful service
##I've never had a better router as far as speed, configuration, features, etc
##I read some reviewers comments that it gets hot
##I have not noticed any problems with it getting hot
##Yes, it does get fairly warm, but in 6 years of running constantly (only turning off when power fails, upgrading firmware, or changing settings that require reboot), heat didn't seem to have any affect on performance
##For the last few weeks though, it has started to drop wireless connections a lot
##One of the LAN ports has stopped working
port[@]##I can still use it if I power it off and on occasionally, but I'd rather not have to do that and also I need that 4th LAN port
##I have no CONs to list for this router
##The DLink DIR-655 is hands-down the best wireless router I have ever used
##Should it have lasted more than 6 years? Perhaps
##but, I worked the heck out of this thing
##I liked it so much I almost bought another one like it
##The ONLY reason I didn't is because they aren't updating the firmware anymore (very sad DLink!)
##The PROs are endless in my opinion
##I filtered by MAC address instead of using passwords
##It made life easier on my network
##This stuff about it getting hot is nonsense (unless it is melting)
##Yes it gets warm, not melting hot though
##And that never caused any problems for me at all
##I work as a network administrator for a large company
##Network devices MUST be kept in a cool place because they DO get warm when they are busy
##If you need a good, dependable wireless router, the DLink DIR-655 (and most of the DIR line) are definitely a good choice
##If you're a techie person who needs to be able to update firmware regularly, this router may not be for you
##It is sad that they aren't continuing to update this router
##However, this doesn't mean it is unusable
##My wireless speeds were top notch, watching Netflix and playing games online wirelessly was flawless
##The range was outstanding
##I could stand a few houses down and stay connected
[t] 12/2011 Worst Product & Customer Service
##This really should have been plug and play
##No such luck
##Almost a month later I'm still trying to get this two work and all I get from dlink is a nice ride on the merry-go-round with canned responses that lead no where
##I think that CS should have to work with the unit before supporting it
##A chimp could go through the computer CS flowchart
##May as well have a voice mail system telling you to press One for this and Press Two for this option
##CS is a joke
##I tried calling, online and even their forum
##They know about the problems they're just not doing anything about it
##So, at the moment I have a $99 paperweight
##I was better off with six year old 2wire router I had
##This unit can't even find the Internet connection
software[@]##And forget the software that says, "Start Here"
##It's useless
##Apparently CS hasn't been informed about it
##Instead they try to give you instructions which have nothing to do with the the disc you're supposed to start with
##They'll insist the disc is not one of theirs and you must be mistaken it with something else
##If you bought one of these lemons, send it back while you still can and get your money back
##Go with something that is plug and play like NetGear
##You're not going to get any love out of this unit
##Only heartache and frustration
[t] Fastest I have ever used
##I own an entirely Internet based company
##I have used countless wireless routers over the years and this one has thus far been by far the best
##I have never used a faster router anytime or anywhere
##The time/ money savings of employees waiting on page loads is huge
##This router has single handedly increased productivity
##Before this we were using the DIR-615
speed[@]##The DIR-615 was and is a great router that very rarely has any issue, decent speed and is low cost
##Nothing in our set up was changed except the wireless router, same computer, same isp, same wireless adapters, same everything
##If loading the address amazon
##com using google chrome took 3 seconds before it literally now takes maybe 1/2 a second
##Thus far we have not experienced any issues what so ever
##Every manufacturer makes a lemon or two but for those folks on here saying that this routers set up is not layman friendly is really a "lame man"
##The set up is beyond dummy proof and even literally shows you in a cartoon what cable goes where
##If you can not figure out the install on this piece of equipment with the included cd and instructions, you should never touch anything more complicated than a shampoo bottle ever again
[t] Buy a different router. I don't care how good of deal this seems like
##I have owned several routers for home and work
##I have setup countless routers for friends and family
internet[@]##After I could not get this router to hold an internet connection, I called DLink tech support
##I spent two hours on the phone with them only for them to say, "It sounds like its a hardware problem and I should get a replacement unit
##" I asked how often this happens and she said, "Quite often
##" Yikes
##Just spend the extra couple bucks and get a Linksys/Cisco
[t] Good distance - easy to setup
speed[@]##Easy to setup - nice speed and I am impressed with the distance
##This router came as a gift from a neighbor who had it sitting around but he had lost the install disk/instructions
##I installed this in the lower floor of a 3 story house - has excellent reception everywhere except one bedroom located on the opposite side of the house on the 3'rd floor
##This is my first wireless router install -- I just plugged it in - reset the router to original factory spec and installed the latest firmware
internet[@],security[@]##I got an internet connection almost immediately and the only thing that took any time was figuring out how to dial in the proper security setting
##At any rate -- I am not a computer guru and if I can set this thing up within a 1/2 hr or so then it should be super simple for someone who is more talented

[t] D-Link 655
##I ordered this to replace my D-Link 615D-Link DIR-615 Wireless-N Router, 4-Port
##The 615 worked great, i never had any problems with it
internet[@]##The only internet problems i would ever have was with Time Warner, and rare occasion i had to reset the cable modem, or when we lost power
##My home has lots of solar guard insulation shielding
##I originally had a Linksys 802
##11g router and we got the insulation work done, the desktop connected to the wireless network had almost had no signal
##I upgraded to the D-link 615, and i was back in business
##The computer in the other room would have about 2-3 bars with the 615
##Now i am considering getting a tablet for the home (not-iPad), and wanted a little more boost
##So i got the 655 with its 3 antenna
##I had a snag connecting the wireless computer to the network
##It saw it, but couldnt connect to the same network because the settings were different (password was the same)
##I called D-link and immediately told me what was wrong
security[@]##I had to change the security properties on the wireless computers (WPA, TKIP, etc
##) There tech support is great
##THey helped the last time i called them too
##Now all my computer had 1 extra full bar of signal all throughout the house
##Granted i am not getting full bars on a computer only 40 feet away, but the solar guard shielding is desinged to block infrared from the EMF spectrum
##For $60 this is a great deal
##I orignally spent about $45 for my Dlink 615, so this was a worthy upgrade
##I should be able to get about $20 for my 615 on ebay
[t] D-Link N Extreme Router
##I am quite pleased with the Router
##All my network items are working well and several visitors have successfully used my network as well
[t] D-link disappointing cheaply made/tested products lately
##This router was ordered to replace one that arrived DOA out of box (a disappointment in itself)
##Followed all steps to install (again) and guess what - powers up but fails to see my modem (roadrunner)
##Calls to tech support were answered "all techs are busy call back later" and line disconnects
##D-link is putting out some real junk lately
##Another example of there being cheap, the power cord on this is like 1' shorter (presuming to save a penny in costs), they are slowly turning what was good product into junk!
[t] Just what I expected
##This item was what I expected based on other reviews, I wish the signal was a little stronger
##I live in a double wide mfg home and router is at back of house and computer is at front and I only get 2-3 bar signal
##I even upgraded my usb adapter to D link extreme dwa-160 dual band adapter and its still on the weak side, it could be its just my computer, its about 6 years old!!!!
[t] Great Buy
##Great buy,This router works flawlessly and easy to set up
speed[@]##It increased my speed and distance by double form my g router
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
[t] Great router for the money
##Setup manually so I don't know how the wizard works
##I use a Linksys 54G ( older unit, before CISCO screwed up the new designs) for wireless with DHCP server disabled that I back-end into this router but this router seemed to perform wireless very well while it was enabled
##Smoke-en hot as a direct cat-6 wired unit which has my son's game PC much happier than on the old ADSL router I was running (converted to fiber)
##I have MagicJack VOIP and this router does an excellent job and actually cleared up a some poor audio quality I was having
##Contrary to some other reviews, the unit runs cool
##Not really sure about the USB port, poor documentation to be sure
##All in all, a great router for the price! SilverFoxDan
[t] Decent Router For the Cost
##I was looking to upgrade my Belkin PreN router earlier this year, and after about 3 weeks of research (yea, I'm slow!) I settled on the DIR-655
##I had some friends recommend D-Link, and I decided to go for it
##Overall, the experience has been pretty good
##I have a fairly large house (about 3000 sq ft over 2 levels) and I get reception in every room with the router somewhat centrally located
##The signal is a bit spotty in my master bedroom, which is the furthest point from the router, and blocked by several walls, but it's tolerable
##I initially bought this with the intent to connect my 500 gig portable hard drive to for backup and storage purposes, but that ended up not working so well
software[@]##The D-Link software is a bit odd, and I just wasn't happy with the setup
##I ended up hooking up my Brother 9010CN Color Laser printer to it, so I could have a wireless network printer, and that's been working well
##very happy with this setup
##At any given time, I may have 3 laptops, a x-box 360 and an ipod touch hitting the router at the same time, and it doesn't seem to skip a beat
##I also connect to work via a VPN connection through the router, and that doesn't seem to be a problem either
##Early on I did experience some random drops, but that's seemed to have cleared up as well
##Oh yes
##I'm running this connected to a cable modem (comcast)
##Since getting the X-Box recently, I'm considering adding a signal booster to this expand my coverage a little bit better, as the x-box is in an area with weaker coverage
##From what I've read, I'm going to go with the Hawking HWREN1 Hi Gain extender
##for those of you with a larger area to cover, check these guys out, Hawking seems to have their act together on this stuff
##Overall, I like this router
##It's got removable antennas, so they can be changed for hi-gain units if desired (I'd rather go the separate unit for what I've read, but it's still a nice feature)
##The USB port, while finicky, it does work and is nice to have
##Coverage is decent for the majority of my needs, and speeds are good
##Keep in mind, if you are on a low quality DSL, this isn't going to make you any faster than your connection currently is, just get you to that connection
##I would buy this unit again, and did so for when helping to upgrade computer equipment at our church recently
[t] Good Wireless Router for Cost
##Pros
[t] Dlink
##Works very well
##I upgraded from a linksys WRT-54G and all my issues went away
##Now my PS3 doesn't disconnect my laptop when I turn it on
##Setting it up was a breeze
##I especially like the guest network that you can setup and leave open
##I am now a Dlink fan!
[t] Not as good as the its reviews state.
##Worked ok the first day
##However, the router and printer only works together part-time at best
##Not as reliable as I had hoped
##At this moment, I cannot recommend this product
##Customer service is ok at best
##Just make sure you don't mind waiting about 20 before someone picks up your line
[t] works good
##It was easy to setup
##But it needs some time to familiarize with router menus
##Once you get a handle, it works like a charm for you
internet[@]##I really saw the difference in my internet browsing after installing this router
##And never went out of wireless range
##Good buy
[t] Worked Great, for 30 days
##Pro's
[t] FANTASTIC router for the price. What more can I say?
##I've installed nearly 20 of these in various locations
price[@]##They are a WONDERFUL router, especially for the price
software[@]##Many user controls, programming is a snap (you can use the Wizard software but don't really need to), and features are wonderfully variable and controllable
##The units are durable; I've encountered only one failure ever and I think someone dropped that one
security[@],speed[@]##Range is great, speed is excellent, many security features and options
##Easily configurable to anything parameters you like
##You will not go wrong with this router
[t] Great, but if you're on COMCAST.. READ This
##Great little router
##The latest firmware ships with 'Advanced DNS' as 'enabled', by default
##D-Link confirmed with me that this feature has a conflict with Comcast
##The 'effect' of that is a good deal of instability and problems
##Took me 2 days, and finally a call to D-link support to get back online
##With much troubleshooting we identified that 'disabling' the 'Advanced DNS' feature makes all thos problems go away
##Still, a great router
##Much better with stability
[t] Don't waste your Money!
##This router lasted about a year then it started dropping wireless signals
##It also had to be rebooted all the time
##It was very aggravating having to reboot the router all the time and had to be in the same room for the wireless to work
##I replaced it with a Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL Router that is working without a hitch!
[t] Router DIR 655
##After used 3month the router get lost signal when I connected 2 laptops in wifi
##I don't have time to call customer service until I did call customers service and show they problem and they said the warranty only 90 days
##If I want the warranty in 2 year I have to paid $99
##So I decided to buy another one but not Dlink anymore
[t] D-Link Router
##easy to install and works like a charm
##the only thing is i can't seem to find the range for the netwrk
##can anyone assist with that?
[t] Wonderful!
##I use it for over a year and have none problems at all!Really great product, i truuly recomed!It have really wide range, i use it from a safe room and all the house connected through it!
[t] Very happy with USED unit from Amzn warehouse deals
##I purchased this as a second DIR655 router for my home network
##I bought it used "in very good condition" from Amazon warehouse deals at a significant discount
##It arrived as described and setup without any problems
[t] Great router
##Very easy setup through the web browser interface
##Performance is very fast
##Excellent range (greater than expected)
##Plus, it's a nice looking box
[t] Less than 1 year, drops connections all the time
##The router was GREAT new
##Loved it
##It did not last one year, starting to drop every few hours, then every few minutes
##Seems like a very common problem
[t] no trouble
##I used many different routers because for some reason my routers always fail on me
##This is a highly recommended router
##It's easy to setup
##The wireless picks up good
##I used it for half a year now and I have no problem with it
##Great buy
[t] Works good

[t] D-Link DIR 655 wireless router
##My brother loves this router
##The wireless is very convenient for use of the PlayStation 3 on line games with friends and solo
[t] Excellent Value and Performance
##We upgraded to wireless N replacing a Linksys wireless G router
##This router was easy to install and has much more configuration options than the our old router
##It's always an adventure to replace a router but once we got familiar with the available admin options were able to configure the settings and get everything connected and working
##Performance is great and at $75 is a great value too!
[t] The Best Wireless Router I have used in the last 10 years

##over 10 years ago
##This purchase is the 3rd wireless router I buy for a client and it works flawlessly

[t] D-link wireless router
##works great and does what I need to do wirelessly
##Always owned D-Link routers because you always get a lot of bang for the buck compared to the other similiar products
[t] Solid and reliable
##Pros - Reliabilityeasy to set upgood coveragegood feature setvalueCons - single-band 802
##11NOn my second unit as we recently moved to a much larger, 2 story house for additional coverage
##The first unit has been with me for close to 4yrs and still rockin
##Gig ports have been tested up to ~400Mb/s (limited by my ~slow NAS)
##No issues with the wifi, even with microwaves, wireless speakers/subs, bluetooth devices
##It was a good value when i purchased the unit in 2007 for $110 but now that it's $69, great value
[t] strong signal, not very user friendly
##I have owned one of these for over 3 years, but I bought a Belkin to replace it
##There were a few times it would either drop my laptop or my desktop if I was using both and had to reboot the router to regain connection
##And no, they didn't have the same IP address
##Pros
[t] recommended router
##i received this item on time and it turns out very strong and stable in terms of signal strength
##Have no problem at all as of writing
[t] Best single band router out there
##This is simply the best single band router out there although it's an older model (2007)
##Took 5 minutes to set it up and works like a charm
##I used it on our three story house with a lot of walls and the Wi-fi signal remains strong to all parts of the house
##This is specially great when you are a bathroom reader who brings their iPhone/iPad devices to read while on the throne
speed[@]##The speed is pretty fast and does not slow down even with multiple devices (my iphone, laptop, PS3) plugged in and running at the same time
##My only complaint is when you change something in the router config it takes a long time for the router to save the settings (around 30 seconds)
[t] Good router
##Pretty much a no-hassle router
##Easy to set up and works well! Only had to reset it once in the several months I owned it and never since the last firmware upgrade
##I liked it enough that I bought one for a friend that needed a new one too
##Only complaints are about the looks -I wish it was black to match the rest of the components in my office, but will gladly give up form for function
[t] papajoe
##Dlink works great so far
##Was easy to install, and get connected
##I also like the look of the unit
##The range is pretty good, but not as good as I was hoping, but this could also be because of the structure of the house and the location of the unit
##All in all, I'm pleased
[t] easy plug and play
##set up the router in my basement home office, it certainly works great there and as well upstairs the range is pretty good and by far better than our old routeris this one the best, longest range, fastest speed? I have no idea but from what we had to what we have it was a great improvement and set up was fast and easy
[t] Nice router
##Bought this unit to replace an existing router that was the same make/model
##This unit was easy to set up and has worked flawlessly
##I would buy again
[t] d-link dir-655
price[@]##great product great price great extreme range works two blocks away from my house,with still 3 bars on my laptop
[t] Handles a heavy, diverse network load well
##I'm a computer geek and I've got a sort of complicated network at home
[t] Do NOt Buy this product -- Hopeless to add repeater
##This family of products is hopeless
##I bought the dir 655 and its sister repeater hoping I could easily string together
##The instructions were useless
##It was hopelessly complex to set up and the online help guides are woeful
##When I called teh manufacturer they told me I needed to wire products together in a way that was never shown in any part of the manual
##When I followed their instructions the router was disabled and despite resetting twice, I could never get it working again
##I lost 8 hours of my life I will never get back
##These guys are terrible and I cannot rate poorly enough
[t] Don't use with XP Pro (32 bit)
##Never have I written a review on a product (good or bad) until now
##Router loses connectivity with cable modem (direct connect to cable modem from computer all is fine) every 1 to 3 days
##Multiple calls and e mails to tech support have not resolved, trying to get refund but I suspect I bought a paperweight
##Had to upgrade the Firware which wasn't were tech support said it was
##Each tech call has same response of manually reconfiguring the router which gets old after the 12th time
##XP Pro will not support WPA, only WEP so real need to buy this anyway as throughput speeds will not increase
##Go with Cisco and don't look back
[t] Good product with speed for the Money
speed[@],port[@]##Good product with speed for the Money, i like the extra USB port so that i could share the printer with other computers
[t] Sub-standard product - Bad customer service and treatment
##Purchased the unit in January based on great reviews on Amazon, once installed, it did not meet my needs and I hated the user interface
##Disconnected the unit,purchased a different brand, Sonic-Wall TZ series from Amazon
##it works great and I love it
##So couple of weeks ago I pulled the DLINK to give it away to a friend, but it wouldn't power-up
##After wasting valuable time on Dlinks horrible website, I contacted their tech support for help for warranty support
##They agreed to send me a refurbished unit right away if I returned the unit at my expense, within 7 days or they would charge my creditcard $150
##00
##So I packed everything I had kept and shipped it
##Today I received an emails from DLINK as follows
[t] Some features don't work with my Apple
##Our household is mostly Windows computers, but I have a Macbook Pro and some of the features (especially the network ones, like the network printer and the network backup disks that I have plugged into the USB port) don't work with the Apple
##If you have Apple computers, I would check compatibility for the features you want to use before purchasing this product
[t] Dropped too often
##We bought the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router to replace our old D-Link DI-524 we had for 5 years
##The DI-524 wireless connection never dropped
##However, it is a little slow and the range is not large enough as we wanted
speed[@]##After we installed the new DIR-655, the range and speed increased
internet[@]##However, the wireless internet connection frequently dropped
##We reset the channels to avoid interference with our neighbor's network
##The connection still dropped constantly
##We have to return this DIR-655
##We are looking another reliable router
##We don't know which one is good yet
[t] Lots of functionality, not pricey but unstable and configuration wait time is too long.
##I was looking for a router to replace an old failing Linksys WRT54G and I end up reading reviews on this one and eventually made the purchased
##The purpose of getting this router was to hope that it will support multiple wireless devices at once (2 Laptop, 2 Smartphones)
##After setting it up on the first night everything seem to run smoothly
##I wasn't pleased with the configuration interface and I'll talk more about that below
##I ran some load test on the router including download, upload and pings for a while and everything seem fine
internet[@][u]##I tried heavy  use with all my devices (4 of them) that were connected via wireless and everything was fine
##I also let my ping run over night till next morning and everything was okay, negligible packet losses
##At this point I thought this router was it
internet[@][u]##Nope, early afternoon on the same day suddenly all my devices were off the 
##I attempted check the router configuration page and I was unable to get to it
##Not via wireless nor wired
internet[@]##So I thought it might be that my cable modem might have disconnected and caused the issue, so I plug in my laptop into the modem directly, internet works fine
internet[@]##The next logical step is to power cycle the router (forget to mention that the router indication lights were all properly lid; power, internet and wireless were steady blue)
##After power cycling the router, everything went back to normal
##So I thought this was just a one time hiccup
##Nope, next day, same thing happen
##The day after, just wireless would go down
##The times when the router failed weren't similar so I don't think the cable modem (or ISP) is issuing anything bad to the router
##In the end, that was enough for me, so I end up spending more and got a different router
##As I mention earlier, there were some annoyance in the configuration interface and I shall list them below along with the Pros and Cons
##Pros
[t] Very slow and connection drops off
##I have it for more than a year now
##Initially it was impressive but now, the download/upload is ~5mbps/2mbps and connection drops off very frequently
##This is not a good product
##Before this, I had a Linksys wrt54g and it was awesome
##I wanted to upgrade and ended up buying this piece of junk
[t] Flawless
##This router has worked flawlessly in my home for over a year
##It ran across a 2100 sq ft home with anywhere from 2-6 different systems (video games, computers, TVs etcetera) using it at a time
##Never had a problem
##I just purchased this one because the other one is my roommates (I moved out) so since did not have any problems I wanted to buy the same one
##Highly recommend this one
[t] 2 years later, still works great!
##I've had this unit for over 2 years
##I never did find a product that uses the "Extreme-N" standard that D-Link was promoting, but it has still worked great with all of our G and other N devices
##I put the unit in our basement, on the bottom shelf of a bookcase and I get excellent signal over 75% of the house
##I can even get a decent signal about 20 feet away from the house in the backyard
internet[@]##I think if I put this unit on the main floor of the house the signal would be even better, but I don't need to since I don't plan on sharing internet access with my neighbors
##Speaking of, the unit has good firmware Linux, and a good interface for admin options
##I have a network drive (My Book World) plugged into the drive and another 500 GB drive daisy chained into that
##No issues in all the time I've owned it - highly recommended
[t] Terrible Signal Throughout, Plenty of Dropped Connections
##I've moved my home to a htpc system using windows media center and xbox extenders
##Every room, save one, is wired for ethernet with a gigabit switch
##I used to have a G router, but when I attempted to steam HD to the one xbox, I simply didn't have the bandwidth to stream smooth hd video
##I made the mistake of buying this router
##My G router served the entire house from my upstairs theatre room
##This router immediately produced dead spots and I began to notice dropped connections
##Same location, same devices, but my newer and more expensive router was simply inferior
##It also failed to deliver the necessary bandwidth to stream a hd feed
##So, using my ethernet outlets, I relocated the router to my office, maybe 20 feet from my wireless xbox
streaming[@]##Still, I could not position it to allow hd streaming
##I also continued to suffer dropped connections
##In frustration, I moved the router to the living room, literally to the other side of the wall from my wireless xbox
##Through the wall, my router is no more than four feet away from my xbox
##Four feet
##Four linear feet away
##It
##Still
##Won't
##Work
##I periodically get hd quality, but it is inconsistent
##My laptop, when used in the evenings only ten feet away from the router will typically drop connection 2-3x a week
##To add insult to injury, in the process of repositioning my router, as I have to do most every night, one of the antenna fell off
##It fell off
##It just fell off
##Despite the many terrible things I've wished on this product, I've never been rough with the device
##No, whatever way the antenna was attached to the metal connector that screws into the router, that failed and the antenna just fell off
##Please, do not buy this product
##Please, do like me and avoid this incredibly substandard device and manufacturer until they can create a product that actually does what it claims to do
##I'm considering selling mine on Craigslist, but it seems like such a mean thing to do
##I think the recycling bin might be in its future
##If nothing else, get this
[t] An Almost Perfect Router
##Let me start by saying that for almost every router that has been reviewed online, there are either rave reviews or terrible ones
##They either seem to work great or fail completely
##You just have to make a comparison between the good and the bad reviews with the router's you've shortlisted
##Then you have to take a small small leap of faith
##I'm glad I took it with this router
##I've owned this router for more than a year now and it has never been switched off
##I've never had it get even the slightest bit hot
##I live in a tropical climate zone where the outside temperatures go up to 45 degrees celsius, thats 113 fahrenheit and this router barely gets warm
##I do keep it standing vertically using the stand that comes with it so maybe giving it extra ventilation helps
##I also remember reading somewhere that the newer models of this came with better heat dissipation so maybe that's what it is
##While trying to set this up I ran into immediate problems
##It comes with a quick start cd that looks very user friendly
internet[@]##I followed all the prompts exactly and ended up with a router that refused to connect to the internet
##Multiple resets and re configs using the cd did not work
##Rather than wasting time with customer service I just went into the manual configuration and set it up there and it worked beautifully
##This however took 30-45 minutes to figure out and there were some stages where I wasn't quite sure what I was doing
##I just googled anything I didn't know
##Ever since it was set up its given me great signal strength across a 2 story house with concrete walls and floors
##In the furthest corners it never goes below 2 bars using a laptop
##I even catch a signal about 10 meters outside my house
internet[@]##I have a 4 mbps internet plan, testing on speedtest
speed[@]##net shows a full speed no matter where I am
##This is why I've decided to give this a 5 star review despite the initial setup problem, that just didn't matter as much to me
##I haven't really used any of its other features so I can't comment on those
internet[@]##If you're looking to access the internet and need something with a huge range and rock solid stability then this is the router to get
[t] D-Link 655 = plug-n-play, FAST, Linux compatible, satellite modem compatible
##The review title pretty much says it all
##I bought this D-Link to plug into a new satellite modem that arrived with absolutely NO features, hoping that the D-Link would provide firewall protection (it has SPI), accommodate my home LAN (has 4 ethernet ports), DHCP and decent wireless capability
##Not only does this DIR-655 provide all these, the install and config was fast and straight-forward
##Router recognizes and supports my 1GB network cards
##The router's Wireless-N is definitely faster, and signal strengths throughout the house are noticeably better
security[@]##As my principal operating system of choice is Linux, I thoroughly enjoyed how the router plugged into the satellite modem and ran with Linux out-of-the-box, I needed only to configure my wireless security and then that, too, took off running
price[@][u]##Considering the features and ease-of-use, this appears to be a great router and at a bargain 
##Highly recommended,(FYI
[t] Very fast and a lot of features but kept dropping signal
##This router has really good coverage as signal was strong even two floors above
##However, it gave me a lot of problems
##Kept dropping signal randomly, sometimes even with a strong signal or a wired connection certain websites would be slow while others would be ok
##I turned off the QoS and all advanced settings and no help
##I also think it had interference with my cordless phone
##As soon as I would pick up the cordless phone, online access would be gone
##Other routers have no issue
[t] Great router, easy setup, great speed, great range
##I just bought this router and it works great
##The setup was easy and I was online 'wired' in a few minutes
##I couldn't get the wireless to work and after a few agonising calls to tech support, I was told to donwload the latest firmware for this product
##It ships with firmware version 1
##02 and the latest is 1
##10
##Once I installed the latest firmware, the wireless worked !!! This router is worth the money
##Go for it
[t] Greatest N Router
installation[@]##Easy installation and flawless connection
##You can't go wrong with this router
software[@]##The trial software "Network Magic" is great for effortlessly bringing it all together
##After the trial certain features are not available however your configuration is still valid
##All in all I would give this router higher than 5 stars if I could
##I did not purchase the D-Link N PCI cards as the reviews on those were not good, but the router is fantastic
[t] Worked like it should
##Had my house networked in no time, with great customer support
installation[@]##Mine was a nonstandard installation
[t] Best Stable N router around
##I owned the Netgear RANGEMAX NEXT WIRELESS-N ROUTER GIGABIT EDITION (WNR854T) before buying the D-link DIR-655
##THe Netgear was plagued with firmware issus
##I had to reset the WNR854T almost everyday due to it locking up
##I finally got fed up and bought the DIR-655 and wow this is a great router full of features and the main thing for me was I have yet had to reset it for locking up
##If you want a stable N router this is the one for you very pleased!!Kevin
[t] After a little fustration installing, it works fine.
installation[@][u]##The install wizard didn't work for me (no obvious reason) and technical help was not that helpful, but after playing with the the manual  it's finally happy with my network
##No problem connecting my "g" standard wireless laptop, and the connection strength is stronger than ever
speed[@][u]##More importantly, my network is now buzzing along at 1gigbit  (don't forget to upgrade all of your network cards as well)
[t] Easy Breezy
##I bought this router after doing a ton of research
##It took me only minutes to get setup and secured
##Now I can go in any room in my apartment and have an "Excellent" wireless signal with no interference
##The setup was guided with illustrations and Viola! you have wireless
##Very happy with my purchase of this router
[t] Nice Router
##This router runs warm so don't have down on the desk or puter
##It also has very bright, blinking blue lights so that it can be used as a night light! Overall, very pleased with it though
##No problems
[t] Nice router
##This is a nice unit
##Easy to setup, enough options to satisfy everyone
##Improvements over previous D-Link units include better user interface, better support for peer-to-peer networking
##I have two wired Macs, two wireless PC's, one wireless Mac, an airport express, a Brother laser printer on the network and they all play well with this unit and with each other
##Gigabit switch is fast, mixed N and G wireless works well
price[@]##A lot of router for the price
##Good buy
##The blue LED's are wicked bright - you are going to want to put this in a closet or wherever it won't give you a seizure or keep you up at night
[t] Wonderfully Extreme
##I am extremely happy about my new 655 router which has surpassed my expectations
##I have had other DLink wireless products but this one has been the best performer
##Not only do I have excellent range and speeds throughout my house but I now can work on my patio or any corner of my large back yard without any problems
##I am getting extreme speeds (130 mbps) and connectivity with devices (notebooks, etc) on my network that have older technology; so you don't have to get an N type adapter for your other devices to perform
##I have always loved DLink products for ease of set-up; almost anyone could get this up and running in no time straight out the box
internet[@]##You may need to contact your ISP for assitance with configuring your DSL or Cable modem to work properly with the router but that may need to be done with any router or device requiring internet access
[t] Extremely simple installation
##This was a breeze to set up
##I'm not a wireless expert just a home user that wanted to go wireless
installation[@]##I purchased this product because I read about how great it was and the easy installation
##The reviews were not wrong
##I only had a slight problem at first because when you insert the set up DVD you must be connected to IE
internet[@]##I was connected to the internet using my AOL interface
##Customer service also wasn't much help to a novice
##They told me to contact my service provider
##I've heard that line before so I decided to try a few things on my own and it worked as soon as I opened IE
##I love it and look forward to using more wireless products in the future
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##Getting it connected and properly set up was not as smooth as I was hoping (and I had help from a techie)
##The instructions jump around a bit and are not intuitive
##Like many items today, not having an owners manual in your hand to help understand what you're looking at is a problem
##The "world" symbol blinked orange and we didn't know it should be blue, but finally figured it out
##Once you're up and running, it's great
[t] herpdederp
##I don't have to reset it, like, ever, and it works reliably
##That's really all I need from a router, so yeah
##I HATE resetting routers
##Glad I went with this
[t] I don't write reviews, but this POS has me typing one out.
##After more than a year of fits and disappointments I upgraded to another brand (not saying which to prevent fake post marketing) and kick myself for not doing the day after I got this POS
speed[@]##It's NOT true "N" speed, could never get any "N" device at home to get up to that speed
##It would overheat, lockup and not even pass some type of traffic consistently
##If I could go back in time and tell myself NOT to buy this thing I would
##All I can hope to do now is bash it with a hammer and put the video on YouTube or something
##My old Linksys G was better than this thing and hell, that router can at least be flashed with DDWRT to give it extra life
##This thing, RUN, RUN AWAY!
[t] Fast wireless
##I just plugged it in hooked it up
##it even setup a secure wireless network through the wizard
##The wireless range is much better then i had before with my linksys and it is about 2x as fast
[t] Disappointed
##This is my third D-link router over the past 10-15 years
##I have always been very happy with them
##I bought the DIR-655 to replace a 5 year old DIR-625 that is starting to get "glitchy" and I have to do a soft reset every day
##I was wary of the bad reviews, but "the experts" at CNET and New Egg said this was a great router, so
##Very easy to set up
##Basically it is idiot proof
##The problem is the range
##I went from a strong 5 bars with the old DIR-625 down to a weak 2 bars with this model
##The distance is maybe 25 feet to my laptop in the bedroom
##It wasn't even recognised at the back of the house
##and I have a range extender
##I will be returning this and stick with my old router
##It is a pain to have to unplug it once or twice a day, but at least it will reach to the very back of the house (60 feet)with a strong signal
##I hate to see D-Link lose their good reputation
[t] Save your money
##Lots of bells and whistles and worked great for about 6 months
##Now it has lots of issues - every few minutes it drops all connections
##Also frequently reboots and is just generally unreliable
##It was great for a while, but now I'm back on Amazon to buy another one 'cuz I can't stand dealing with this thing anymore!
[t] D-Link 655 Extreme
##I have had this router for about a month which has replaced the tried and true Linksys WRT54G
##Although I have about 10yrs of experience setting up networks for businesses and homes, this particular router could be setup by even the most novice of users right out of the box
##I'm currently using the 655n to wirelessly stream Netflix to my living room, our Nintendo Wii in the kid's playroom and as a print server for two laptops, a netbook and a custom desktop PC
##The first week owning the router I noticed it would occasionally drop signal to the Wii
##Putting the Wii on the Guest wi-fi fixed that
##(setup for this is easy by the way)The desktop PC acts as a file and media server as well
##Transferring large files via wifi from desktop to laptop or laptop to laptop hasn't been a problem
speed[@]##I'd rate the speed at 8 (out of a possible 10)
##I'm also an avid gamer and had noticed lag in some games
speed[@]##After doing some research, I manually set the upload speed from the default *auto* to 1Mb and that took care of that annoyance
speed[@]##You'll need to check with your ISP if you don't know what your upload speed is
##I'm on a 5 megabit down / 1 megabit up account
##Also, although I had tweaked my previous router with WRT firmware, I really don't see the need to do that with the 655 as of yet
##If you can get this router on a sale like I did, you'll find that this is a great buy
##Aloha
[t] Not long-term reliable
##Have had this router for only a few months
##Wireless radio needs daily resetting
##It just stops working after about 24 hours
##Now the ethernet connection drops for no apparent reason
##Last time it happened, I connected the modem directly to my computer to make sure there was no problem with the ISP, and the signal was blazing fast
##Rehooked the router, no connection
##Rest the router, no connection
##Reinstalled the router from scratch
##No connection
##Then after an hours it started working again
##Then after while it stopped
##You get the picture
##So I am shopping for a new router
##My advice for this one? Avoid!
[t] Very Nice Router
##Have had this router for a little over a month now, have it hooked up LAN to another computer in my house, and hooked up wireless to my daughters laptop and my desktop, setup was a breeze, it has worked excellent since hook up, no drops, signal strength is very good, I get excellent reception wherever I am in my house, yep the blue lights are very bright
##Would recommend this router it works great
[t] Not what I'd hoped for
##I purchased this router to replace a Belkin N+ which had drop out issues
##This D-Link worked fine for a couple of months and now it too has developed drop outs
##I have to reboot it about once a week and a couple of times I had to reboot it multiple times in order to get it functioning
##The router has great features and a fair range but I need uninterrupted service
##Another thing I dislike about this router is that I have not been able to control it remotely
##I travel some and have network cameras using the router but I can not access it remotely to make changes; this is not a deal breaker but it would be nice
[t] Rock Solid, High Performance and Reliability
##This is a great router
##It replaced a dying linksys WRTG54g router
##It's stable, rock solid, fast wireless, and has great signal
##I should have bought this a long time ago
[t] Works as advertised
internet[@]##I needed a router with a "guest" feature so that visitors to my Airbnb rental could have internet access without having access to my personal wifi network
##This model's specs looked like the best value for the money and I wasn't disappointed
##It arrived quickly and works as advertised
##Setup was uncomplicated
##The range is as good or better than the Belkin model it replaced
##I've had it close to a month and have no complaints
[t] Easy and inexpensive
##Bought so I could wirelessly connect multiple laptops and stream through my Roku
##Works beauty
##I think I paid about $75 for it including shipping
##It has a lot of lights, way too many
##They are big, bright, blue, and many
##Lights up the room at night
##It does not bother me some much as seem like a waste of electricity
##That said, well worth the money
[t] The first one was defective, the second was horrible
##I bought this a few months ago
##the first one did not work
##It had to be returned, at my expense
##The turnaround time for replacement was ok
##The main complaint I have is that it refuses to connect to any of the Macs I own
##I have tried 2 different Macbook Pros
##They will not connect
##It connects with an XP PC a Windows 7 PC and XBOX 360, although the connection is erratic at times
##I have called tech support at DLink and Apple and each says it is the others fault
##The Ironic part is that I have used bootcamp on my old 2008 Macbook Pro and am able to connect
##Yet, not with OSX on the same damned machine
##It even connects to my iPhone
##I am lost
##In the end
##I have had no issues with my Airport Extreme with any devices
[t] Stopped working after about 10 days...
##After only 10 days or so, this router stopped working and caused connection interruptions every 10 mins
##My Wife and I work from home and need our connection to be on 24/7; ergo, the constant hiccups were beyond frustrating
internet[@]##I consider myself somewhat computer literate but had to hire a technician to come in and fix my internet connection
##After about two hours of rebooting everything, searching for firmware, etc
##we came to the conclusion that it was definitely the router -- versus the computers, modem, coax cable, ISP provider, etc
##When it did work, it wasn't the easiest to setup and changing the settings was a hit overwhelming
##Spend the extra money and buy the Cisco/Lynksys E4200, which is the polar opposite of this very disappointing router
[t] Unreliable Internet Connectivity
##A gigabit wireless n router for under $70? Needing higher speeds after building a home media network, I jumped at the deal
##Twice
##More on that later
##The router arrived at my doorstep, and within minutes I had boxcutter in hand ready to connect it up and enjoy the new gigabit speeds
##I decided to use the included CD to install it
##After connecting all of the wires, the setup program instructed me to turn on the router
##Several minutes after the router was on, the install program still could not detect it
##Oh well, I'd have to set it up manually
security[@]##I logged in the router, set up security for the wifi, and I was up and running in about 2 minutes
internet[@],speed[@]##The speed and range were both great, and as soon as I started to feel good about my purchase, the internet stopped working
##Oh well, I thought, probably just a fluke since the modem hadn't been power cycled since I replaced the router it was connected to
internet[@][u]##So I reset the modem and router, and minutes later I was back on the 
##Little did I know, that was a sign of things to come
internet[@]##Over the course of the weekend that it was connected, the internet dropped intermittently
##And when i say intermittently, I mean I couldn't go an hour without it going out
internet[@]##I could still access shared files on my network, but I couldn't get out to the internet
##I replaced the new router with my old Linksys 10/100, left that connected for a couple days, and did not get a single drop
##After reconnecting the new D-Link, I immediately was faced with the issue again
##D-Link support isn't too great
##As with most companies these days, they have outsourced their "tech support" to India, meaning not only is it difficult to understand the technology jargon, but also tough to understand the Indian accents and broken English
##After a couple calls and about an hour troubleshooting the router, I was told it was probably defective and I should return it to Amazon
##Not giving up hope, I decided to replace it with a new one (5 stars for Amazon's return policy!)
##Boy was I disappointed when the new unit did the same thing
##This one seemed even less reliable than the first one! After another call and another hour troubleshooting, I was told they had to pass me on to level 2 support
##"Someone will call you within 10 minutes to continue troubleshooting
##" That was 4 days ago
##I decided to return the second unit and get a refund, hoping for better luck with another brand
##For the price, it's not a bad router - if it works properly
##Obviously this problem isn't happening to everybody, so don't let me scare you into avoiding this router - just keep the original packaging and order from Amazon so you can return it easily if needed!
[t] Keeps Dropping the Wi-Fi Signal
##I bought this router in December because of the reviews on here
##After 30 days (past the return policy of the store I bought it at), the router kept dropping my Wi-Fi signal
##I called D-Link on 5 different occasions to try and fix it and they had me configure the router as many times, but nothing worked
##The router still kept dropping the signal
internet[@]##Then I thought it was the modem from my internet provider, so I switched out the modem for a new one with my ISP to see if that would fix it
##Failed
##I took the router back to the store I bought it at, and they only gave me a replacement of the same one
##So I'm on my SECOND D-Link DIR-655 and it's still dropping the signal
##So now every time it drops the signal (which is almost every time I get on my computer), I have to restart the whole system from the computer to the router
##It sucks
##DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER! The customer service from D-Link is no help
[t] Not easy to setup in Win 7
##For some reason this wasn't easy to setup
##I think Win 7 is to blame but who knows
##At any rate after getting it up and running it works great
##Better coverage and slightly faster than my old Linksys 54G
##I couldn't get my printer to work with the USB SharePort feature though
##I could print MS Office documents but not from IE or Chrome
##UPDATE
[t] Good Idea But Not Fuly Functional
##I have purchased a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router which is capable of 4 hardwired connections to it as well as wireless connections
##The setup was painless and my connections (wired and wireless) are working
software[@][u]##HOWEVER the SharePort never has never worked even using the shipped 
software[@][u]##I tried using different versions of the  but still I could not get it working
##So if you are looking to share a printer or storage device, this is not the router for you
##This is no more than a plain vanilla wireless router with 4 wired ports
##I am very disappointed with it and would advise looking elsewhere if you want to hang a printer or a storage device off your router
[t] Perfect
##No problems what so ever setting it up
##It has good range and doesn't disconnect at all
internet[@],speed[@]##My internet speed is still very fast while behind this thing
[t] Just FYI##So after trying a few other routers, I saw that this router was rated really high for gaming
##So I figured what the heck
##Well little did I know, it may be good for games but has serious issues with bittorrent traffic
##The thing will bog down any network if a bittorrent client is running, and there really isnt any way to get around it
##It's just how its made
##I am returning and ordering the Acer Black Diamond instead
##It is built for both
[t] VERY satisfied with my first wireless router - non tech-y review
##It's in my nature to do hours of research so after hours of research on wireless routers, I finally settled with this
##Price is good, but more importantly the set up, security, wifi speeds, and reliability is great
##I'm tech savvy enough to read directions and set up wifi in the house so it was not a painful process
##I got my wifi up and running on the first try
##I have several devices connected wirelessly - ipod touch, iPhone (rarely on wifi), PS3, desktop computer, and a laptop
internet[@]##There have been instances when wifi would suddenly stop or the internet would slow to a crawl
##However the latter issue was resolved when I shut off the wifi on the Apple products
##The only issue I have with this is limited range and it seems to depend on the device
##The wifi is set up on the 2nd floor
##When I attempted to set up my 2nd desktop on the 1st floor, the signal was incredibly weak at about ~20%
##Not enough to connect
speed[@]##When I moved the desktop to the 2nd floor across the hall from the wifi, signal went up to ~35% and worked great with no speed issues
##However, when I bring my laptop down anywhere on the first floor, I have had no issues
##I'd recommend buying this wireless if you aren't looking for the latest and greatest
##Easy set up, high reliability, but seems to have limited range depending on the device (from 1st floor to 2nd floor with some areas being concrete
[t] Lasted ONLY 3 months
##Bought in March, Wireless is now cutting in and out
##Direct connections work fine--but come on--90 days before the wireless goes
##I haven't tried customer support--not sure it's worth it, last time I had a similar issue took forever for them to tell me to reset the router, update the firmware--and still had the same issues
##No more D-LInk for me--I'll be buying NetGear
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##Great quality router
##We rely on it at our home, which has multiple wireless devices, and have never been disappointed
##We have installed it at relatives homes too
[t] Great Router
speed[@]##Router has increased speed and range over my old Linksys Wireless G router
##The setup script didn't work, but I called D-Link and they walked me through the manual setup
##I'm very happy with this router
[t] iroc818r
##After looking at the reviews I was convince that it was a great product, it really is not like they made it sound
##It is good but not that good, the range is not as good as it is advertise
##It is a good product if you got like three computers or less connected to it, if you got some type of gaming console connected, then you will run into problems
##When you have a gaming console connected it begings to disconnect other users connected to your network
##As for everything else,you got yourself a good router, as for range and gaming is not the best
[t] Cool!
##It's really cool router
##Using with MacBook Air and iPhone 4 with wi-fi N
##Everything is speedy!No any lags, easist set up
##Highly recommended!
[t] Easy Set-Up - Great Speeds
##After having a lot of problems with the Motorola 6580 modem + router combo, I ended up getting this + Motorola 6120
##Set-up was extremely easy
##Followed the install via the disk and was up and running in no time
##My wireless speeds are on average 15 Mbps and often getting into 25 - 30 range
##I only had one problem with this item
security[@][u],software[@]##My company installed upgraded  software and after that I found I was having problems in connectivity for my work computer
##Took awhile to figure it out, but after some research, the problem stemmed from compatibility issues with the firewall
port[@]##There's a couple ways to get around this; DMZ, port forwarding, virtual server and just turning off the firewall
##I run HULU and Netflix on my PS3 with HD and I have no buffering stalls even though I have two personal computers going and two Androids connected
##The interface to make changes is very easy - albeit reading the manual helps a great deal
[t] Very bad experience with this product
##I spent at least three hours trying to set up this router in replacement of an older and slower, but still functioning, D-link one
##Only one of my three computers on the former network recognized the new router
##I called D-link's tech support and was on the phone with them for a good hour
##The guy (name available on request) finally said he would phone me back in 10 minutes
##He never did
##After trying again to set up the router by myself, I phoned back tech support, and talked to somebody (name available on request) who seemed somewhat more knowledgeable -- but this was probably only an illusion
##After another 15 minutes on the phone and me climbing back in the ladder again to reach the router, the thing did work briefly
##But it stopped shortly after the phone call
##I don't know if it happens often with this product, but the item was obviously defective
##Worse, the tech support people don't seem to have "defective" as an option in their diagnosis!
[t] Great Buy and Great Product
##Easy to set up and great router to have
##Wonderful reception! Have had in about 4 months now without any problems what-so-ever
[t] Great router
##Great router
##Dlink seems to be hit and miss with their routers, but this is definitely one of their better ones
##Firmware is feature rich and it is easy to configure
##Range is better than my old Linksys WRT54
##Highly recommended product
[t] Best investment I ever made
##I had been using a linksys router for a year
##and after multiple dropped signals in a day while studying for my boards, i had it
##Time warner assured me it was an equipment issue
##So I looked up reviews and found this router
##After ONE year of owning this router, i have NOT had a single problem with the signal
##even with an avid gamer in the house who also downloads movies in his spare time
[t] Great Wireless N Router
##I would buy this as gift and my self again
internet[@]##East setup and very fast internet with windows 7 no install CD needed
speed[@]##Test speed up to 30mps with Time Warner Cable as IP
##Work better then Cisco routers and easyer setup
[t] Bad range.
##I bought this router to replace my older D-Link router to get better range
##I use a Samsung TV with Internet@TV and an XBox360 as a media extender in my living room which is ~45 feet away from the router
##There is no obstructions or interference
##I could not stream HDTV due to too weak of a signal no matter what I tried, so I decided to buy this router
##I replaced it and set up the new router with no issues
##I went and connected the x-box to the new router and was very disappointed to see that signal was actually worse
##I was getting 8-9 bars (out of 15, 11+ needed for HD) with the old router, and now I'm getting 3-4 bars with this one
antennas[@][u]##The  on this unit are small and cheap
##Less than half of the power of my previous years old standard 1 antenna (but bigger and better) d-link router
##I'm going to try another brand which states to have better range
##I would not recommend this router if you're looking for good range
[t] Took a minute to figure out...
##I previously had a Linksys WRT54 wireless router that was so simple to set up so when I started working on this router I thought it shouldn't be so difficult
##How wrong was I!!My only single piece of advice for folks buying this router is this- YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER OR IT WILL NOT WORK
##lol
[t] Great speed
##een using this router for over 6 weeks now
##These are some of the quirks that have happened to me
##Worked fine with an older modem but switched to an SB-120
speed[@]##Found out that QOS should be turned on and let the router do it's own speed test
##Which by BTW acts like it's not doing anything for a minutes
##Then comes back on
speed[@]##I actually ended up set QOS to manual and selecting my current up speed
##We turn off router and modem at night
speed[@]##In the auto mode the router runs a speed test each time it is turned on
##Got tried of waiting so switch to manual
##Up dated the firmware because the Mac keep dropping the wireless
##Turns out it is a problem with 10
##6
##3 update not the router in this case
security[@]##Initially set up a simply WEP security and found out that to get N wireless you must use WPA/128 or no security
##That does work
##Also I have turned off all of D Link's services
##I just don't need them
security[@]##Have done away with security for now also as we live in a rural area where homes are a few
port[@]##I have not tried the USB port as the new printer is wireless and the SD card can be accessed by both computers which was all I was going to use it for
##I real like this router
##After it's initial problem it has performed
##At times I have thought that it has screwed up only find it has been another problem
##Such as my vendor has had problems or servers very slow
##It's been running with out doing anything to it for about 4 weeks
speed[@]##As for speed love it
##I have a 6M/512k
##It now loads most pages so quick hardly ever see any loading indicators
##It is for the most part flash text, flash ads
##About that quick
speed[@]##Same speed readings as my old router
##Just handles the packets a lot better
streaming[@]##Also video clips and streaming very seldom freeze
##So yes I think it's a very good router
##But maybe it could be a little more setup friendly
##Just one last thing if get into the thru your browser? Do not use the Enter key! It will kick you back out
##Point click and be patient
##Eric
[t] Secure Spot Issues
##This router was very easy to setup, very easy to use
##However, it has some bugs that appear if you are not using their Secure Spot service
##Contacting their customer support gave a work around, but due to the frequency of the issue, I ended up buying the linksys competitor instead
##If you would like the details, read on
[t] Great router
security[@]##Easy installation, great security features - especially loved how it created a text file on the desktop of all your settings, all and all a good router
##The wireless reception could be better, but I just attached the d-link antenna I used on my old DSL router and it improved it greatly
[t] Does not deliver stated speeds, unreliable
##I purchased this item based on the highs review here, but I am disappointed and regret my choice because it does not deliver the stated performance levels reliably
##This router is easily overloaded and struggles to deliver the full N speeds across the wireless network
##This results in stuttering web video streams, poor file transfers which hang part way through, and a need to restart the unit every few days to restore performance
##It's worth reading the dlink support forums to see what others say about this router -- it sounds like many users have the same issues with the dir-655 that I do
##I'm switching back to my 6 year old 802
##11g router, which had no issues at the same usage level
[t] Best WIFI Device in the market
##I used the G based Belkin Wifi for 9 years
##It works great but had to move on to N Wifi
##hence, ended up buying a Belkin N
##It was a disaster and I returned it
##Then, I bought this device after much research and thanks to you all 900+ people that helped make my decision
##The device is the best I have seen so far in any Wifi units
##I have three laptops, a VOIP phone, and an iPhone
security[@]##I hooked up all devices, turned on WPA-PSK security with a breeze, turned on DHCP Server for second layer of security, turned on MAC ID filtering for third stage of protection
##Then, I have hidden the SSID broadcast
##The device is two floors above in our loft and when I use laptop in our garage or backyard, it still works at mind-blowing lightening speeds
##Had the device ON for two weeks and not even once did it terminate connection
##And there is guest Wifi access control too so your guests dont have to "unintentionally" eavesdrop in your wifi and your files etc
##Now the awesome part! The SharePort Utility
##If you are a intermediate tech user like me, you will love this
##Using the D-Link's shareport utlity, I hooked my Seagate 500GB external hard drive to this router and guess what, I just made the hard drive - a NAS drive
##Yes, I uploaded all the content on to this newly connected NAS drive and am able to access files on any machine within our network
##Remember that you have to individually download and install Shareport on each machine that you would like to connect to NAS drive
##And at any point of time, only one computer can connect to NAS drive
##I found one glitch in the Shareport but realized it was my mistake
##I have two Win 7 systems and one XP machine
##Out of all, one of them is a WIn 7 64 bit
##I installed 32 bit version of shareport and it was not able to connect properly
##After googling, I uninstalled 32 bit shareport and installed 64 bit and all is working great
##For those of you wanting to monitor and control your kids' surfing habits and stuff, Dlink's Secure Spot tool will be of great help, which is included with the device
##Folks, this device is worth every penny and more
##Dont waste lots of money on routers that look futuristic but do not do the job right
##Spend less than $100 and get this one
##I am so happy I ran into this device and thanks to you all for writing valuable reviews
##Thought I will share my views as well
[t] Good product but useless tech support (ip address issue)
##This is my fourth router purchase
##I originally had a SMC Barricade for about 7 years
##When it started dropping connection 1-2 times a day, I replaced it with a Netgear WGT624 108mbps router which worked but slower
speed[@][u]##A few weeks ago I purchased a Belkin N router thinking it had better compatability than the Dlink DIR 655 alternate choice in order to improve the 
##The Belkin was terrible
speed[@]##It ignored the password I tried to add and the speed was not improved from my old Netgear
security[@]##Tech support was no help when I lost several computers off the network after I had tried to implement wireless security
##So I bought the Dlink DIR 655 for about $20 more
##Right away it seems a more robust router with the gigabit switch and it was backwards comptatible with my b hardwired computers and my g bridge
##I don't use wireless yet so that will be for future functionality
##I did lose the view of several computers on my network and had to call tech support on 3- 4 occasions
##What a waste of time
##I have in the past gotten excellent network configuration guidance from Linksys (on my WAP 54G wireless access points- I also called them but my WAP are out of warranty- over 5 years; so that is fair, although the new reviews for Linksys products indicate that their tech support quality is much lower these days; part of the reason I considered Dlink)
##The Dlink tech support is totally useless
##After long waits, automated phone menu you get an offshore tech support person who is poorly trained
internet[@]##The extent of the advice you get is to stick a paper clip in the reset hole and once you get internet access on one cpu, they feel their job is done and they proceed to tell you that that is all the support they are trained/authorized to provide you
##Never mind that you lost the view of half of your network and your shared computers resources no longer work
##I finally figured it out for myself
##I recalled when I had my network set up at some point the ip addresses on the workstations were static assigned
##Those I had to change when the new interim routers were installed to automatically assign ip addresses
##The problem with the dlink was their gateway default router address is 192
##168
##0
##1 while my previous router was 192
##168
##2
##1
##Once I went into the admin login for the dlink and changed the gateway router address to 192
##168
##2
##1 and the range to 192
##168
##2
##2 to 192
##168
##2
internet[@]##99 and rebooted my workstations, every computer is seen by the router and can get to the internet thru the cable modem attached to the router
##I am still having issues with some of the workstations accessing the shared resources on the 2nd workgroup (access permission error message) but I am much closer to getting back to the way things were
##This all took 3 full days and late nights and I am debating whether fixing something that wasn't broken was worth it or if it was a comfort to know that if it didn't work I could always go back to the old slow Netgear
##Anyway, thanks to the good product reviews on Amazon for this product
##I am pleased with my purchase
##Just be warned, it can take a bit of tweaking and searching on the web to make it work
[t] Easy and fast
software[@]##I called the DLink support and had it setup with my Macbook very easily, without downloading any software or having to install anything
##It was up and running within minutes
##The n wireless is very fast
##From the other end of my house (~100 feet) I still got 5/5 bars of signal
##An excellent buy!
[t] Worth every penny
##I was a frustrated customer trying router after router and returning all of them
##Among the ones I tried
[t] Superb router with amazing features
##I bought this router mainly cos my other router (a Belkin) started to repeatedly reboot and overheat
streaming[@]##I have a lot of traffic on my home networks, which includes streaming video from two wireless TiVos, 3 laptops, a media PC that is on 24/7 sucking RSS feeds and sharing to network, VoiP phone, etc
##This router not only claimed to handle it all but could prioritize traffic based on content
##So I gave it a try
##Well, I'm getting 108Mbs to my N cards (expected as not all network is N) and consistent strength and quality to all other devices
##There 3 main reasons for this review though
[t] Easiest Installation Ever, Excellent Performance
##I did a LOT of research to determine which wireless router was considered to be the best
[t] Great Product
##Great product - easy setup, has worked great for weeks now, looks to be ready to work well for a long time to come
##Looks great on any desk, works at very high speeds - excellent product, and highly recommended to anyone who is looking for either a wireless or wired router
[t] Great Wireless Base Station
##Works great in my house with mixed macs and pcs
##Range is incredible, and the wireless-N machines seem to coexist very nicely with the wireless-G machines
##I like the simple, upgradable firmware, UI and reliability
##It's fast, easy to configure and a fair value
[t] Great performance, hassle setting up
##(1/29/09) Geez - what a stupid policy
software[@],port[@]##Amazon told me there can only be one review per item AFTER I typed for several minutes to update this one, but gave me no way to save what I'd typed! Anyway,I downloaded and installed the software to run a shared printer off the USB port on the router - worked beautifully! Just be sure you update the firmware (in a wired configuration, NOT wireless) first
##Still 4-stars, for the reasons below
##This is a great router
##But, pay attention to which existing wideband setup you are converting from
##If DSL (PPPoE), make sure you find out if you need to set your existing DSL modem to "bridge mode" before setting up the router
##I was aware of the potential requirement, but my decision to let the D-Link "set up wizard" proceed without doing this first, was a major mistake
##I got a really fast, immediate connection, which failed within an hour
##After a couple of hours on the phone with D-link I was set up ok
##D-Link support people were courteous but I had to escalate to the next level to find someone who could cope with my problem
##Upgrading the firmware (which I needed to do to establish the USB printer connection to the router for sharing) was easy, but required re-doing the entire setup
##In fairness to D-Link,there is a FAQ on their web site that could have saved me the entire hassle, but I didn't go that far into it
##Nothing in their wizard tells you to not use it for DSL/PPPoE
##Amazon's product that I bought was about six months out of date for firmware
##Amazon had appaently had it in stock for about 8 months, so the D-link upgrades that had happened were not included
security[@]##D-Link gets excellent ratings for design and performance, but somewhat less for 1) the wizard does not detect the need to reconfigure your DSL modem, and 2) the wizard does not direct you to the need to go to the manual setup to configure your security settings
##THIS IS IMPORTANT! The router performance once set up correctly is rock-solid, and very fast
##I don't understand how it can be faster on downloads than my original DSL, but it is! I'm using 802
##11n so maybe that's it
[t] Great once you get it configured. Very fast!
##My setup
[t] So far so good with the D-Link DIR-655
##I just installed this router today and it's up and running
##My PC is connected on one of the LAN ports, an iTouch via 802
##11G, and a Mac Powerbook on 802
##11B
##The throughput on all ports is significantly higher than my previous router
##I had another D-link which worked well for many years before finally failing, so I figured I'd try another
##Things I like so far
[t] Simple setup - great performance
##The wireless signal in my house was really disappointing me, so I decided to upgrade my router and step up our game a little
##The signal from this router has been outstanding
##I don't have any of the problems I used to have
##And I haven't had to reset it once
##That's great, compared to what I'm used to
[t] Drops wireless connection on EVERY channel.
##Device cannot sustain a wireless connection longer than 1 minute
##Tried all the "workarounds", such as switching channels and bands
##Happens on two different laptops and 2 different iPhones
##The web interface is also needlessly difficult and illogical to navigate
##Go elsewhere
##This device is garbaaage
[t] Too pricey for the features and flaky/defective
##Pros
[t] Great wireless router
##I bought this wireless router specifically for my two Roku players I bought this past Christmas
##So far it works great
price[@][u]##Setup was easy, the unit is attractive and the  was right
##Our house is approximately 1,400sf with the Roku players on the first and second floors with no connectivity problems
##We have also had no problems from any of our guests using this router with their wireless devices
##Overall I'm quite pleased with this router
[t] Very good
##This router works very well right out of the box
##It also has excellent coverage through our two story house
##One reason I purchased this model was that we could print from the router's USB without the need for a host computer to be running
##In that regard, I am still having difficulty attempting to get the SharePort Utility to function normally
##The SharePort manual and help screens are very minimalistic
[t] Worst ever product purchase
##I bought this product by reading some of the great features mentioned about this online
##Also, I had earlier Dlink product which gave me little trouble but overall worked satisfactorily
##But this product purchase is worst ever buy
##This always gets disconnected and I have to reboot the router at least twice a day
##I called the DLink company and their customer service is absolutely horrendous and junk
internet[@]##I called them thrice to get the problem resolved and those ***holes just closed the call saying it is a problem with my internet service provider
##If you are wise enough don't ignore my review and never try your luck against these Dlink products
##It is just trash and I wasted my money on it
[t] I hate this router
##Ive had this router for over 2 years and its always messing up my modem and wifi
##I have to reset it about 5 times before it will start working again
##Im buying an Airport Extreme to replace this with
[t] Good steady signal
##Bought this to replace an outdated Linksys router
##The D-Link was a snap to set up and it delivers a strong steady signal to 3 PC's and a laptop
##It works in any room,garage and even outside on the front porch or rear patio of our brick house
##This is a great router
[t] Excellent Device
##This router was a replace of my old router that used to disconnect and reset itself
##So far I am happy with it; its very easy to set up and its performance is superior
##Certainly I'll recommend it
[t] Works ok as a bridge.
##I bought and returned this router back to Amazon
##Every 3 days it would just stop moving data
##No error lights or anything to tell me there was an issue
##So back it went
##I was browsing the thrift store one day, and I they had this same router
##It didn't have any antennas, or the power adapter
##But it looked perfect so I paid the $3
##99 and left
##I eventually found 3 mismatched antenna laying around and used them
##All 3 are different lengths and brands
##I use this one differently than the last one
##I use it as a secondary access point to my primary router
##This one had the latest firmware, so the bridge option was removed by Dlink
##But I found a guy on the web that had a work around that actually worked! Several other work rounds did not work
##So I use this $3
streaming[@]##99 router for streaming HD tv to my garage, 2 floors straight down
##It makes the connection at around 72mbps
##Sometimes it shows that it's connected at 150mbps
##It's worked flawlessly for 24hrs a day for weeks now as a bridge
antennas[@][u]##It streamed the playoffs perfectly to my garage with only 2  attached!! I eventually bought a 3rd antenna
##But I still never tried using it as my main router like the first one from Amazon
##So for the very specific way I'm using this second router from the thrift store, I'd give it 4 stars
##The original one I'd give it 2 stars
##So I'm giving it an over of 3 stars in this review
##I don't know if Amazon allows this, but here is the link to the bridge mode set up that I found online
##[
##]If they don't have it, you can google it with DIR-655 & Bridge Mode in the Dlink beta forums
##Scroll down about 2/3 down

[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router
##Purchased this last month
##Quick set up and easy to use
##Better range than my old Linksys and better features for just a few dollars more
##Have had several power events (power outage, surge, etc) and this router doesn't have any problems keeping in communication with the cable modem
##So far no complaints
[t] Router experience
##I have used the DIR-655 for years now and it is the best i have seen and used
##Reliable workhorse that has range of over 150 feet if not obstructed
[t] Great value
##Very easy to install into our network, and has been very fast with a very wide wireless range
##This is the second D-link router i have purchased and will buy the brand again
[t] Unimpressed
speed[@]##I bought this router because I wanted better range and higher speed in my house
##Well I got the speed, but not the range and a whole bunch of additional headaches on top
speed[@]##The Positives - the speed is undoubtedly there for our wireless devices
##Apps load data faster on iPhones, laptops run better, no question
##But that's all i can find to be happy with
##The Negatives - The range is no better than my old D-LINK Wireless G Air Plus router
##I wanted extended range so my iPhone would get a stronger Wi-Fi signal in my basement, but it's really no different
##But the biggest headache was setting up my wireless HP printer
##It took me 5 DAYS(!) to get the router and printer to communicate
##And I ended up using some cunning with my old D-Link router to get it work
##The issue appeared to be a common one too - one which I could find no solution to on the web
##Thank goodness I'm IT savvy
##It also frequently seems to not recognize wireless devices it once did and I have to unplug it for around 30 seconds then power it back up again to get it to work
##You also appear to have to do this if you change a setting in it's configuration options for the new setting to take effect
##If you're looking for a Wireless N router, I'd suggest looking somewhere else
[t] Didn't work for the reason I got it
##I bought this item because the description read, "6x farther range*"
##I think the only way this is true is if the disclaimer was, "moderate to complete exaggeration
##" In short, the cheap router that came with the cable modem was equally mediocre
##I'm returning this item and taking the range extender route
[t] Stay Away
security[@]##This router does not support any filtering options other than your typical aes security
##No web filtering works, even dlink can't get it to work
##Also don't get any more than 20 ip addresses using at any given time or it will crash
##Been using this at home and overseas for a couple years now
##It is very frustrating and isn't compatible with dd-wrt
[t] I'm sure there are Better Ones Now-I've Had Issues
##When I first purchased this router a few years ago, I loved it
##However, I am one of the people who have had issues with it, namely the wireless signal dropping out several times a day
##If you search issues with the router, you'll find that it has an issue with dropping wireless
##It seems to be related to the firmware version, but the older version which didn't appear to have any issues can no longer be loaded into the router
##About 4 times a day, the router will drop the wireless signal
##So everyone on will get disconnected for 1 minute to 15 minutes
##Very annoying
##You can unplug it and power it back up and it will come on, but none the less, annoying
##I plan on replacing it as soon as I can find the time to reconfigure whatever new one I purchase, which will take me hours
[t] Works like a charm!
##Bought this D-Link DIR-655 to work with a Motorola Surfboard SB6121 router and it works wonderfully right out of the box
##We have a desk-top PC, wireless printer, laptop, ipad, and two cell phones connected to it and still receive high strength signals throughout our 3 story hours
##I did not have any of the problems some others listed but you should keep one thing in mind - this is a router, not a modem/router combination
##So you must use a cable or DSL modem attached to it (see the directions included in the box)
##If you try to replace your modem with just this router, it won't work
internet[@]##Your computer will show that it's connected to the internet when it really isn't
##Just follow the directions, make sure the D-Link's firmware (software) is updated to the latest version and you should be fine
[t] Awesomely fast and reliable router!
##We bought this router because we had 3 laptops and an XBOX 360 that needed constant, clear and fast connection
price[@]##This router had a great price compared to others like it, and even a half-way decent look about it
speed[@]##Our main concern in buying it was whether it would carry all of our devices giving each a fast speed and unbroken connection
##And it is more than we expected! We have had 4 laptops, XBOX 360, my satellite tv AND my new BR-DVD player going all at the same time
##not lightning fast speed, but definitely unbroken connection and way better loading times than we were seeing before
##This router rocks! I'm about to add a tablet to the connections and have absolutely no worries that it can handle it
internet[@]##At that point we will have 7 items connected to our internet access
##Definitely worth the money and I would highly recommend this brand and model to anyone!
[t] Gigabit All The Way
##Very easy setup
##It took about 10 minutes to have my wireless network up and running
speed[@]##I had quite a speed increase
##I had a Linksys G wireless router that was getting me about 5-down & 3-up
##Now I am getting about 20-down & 6-up
[t] This is where you should stop looking around.
##I was in the market for a wireless router for my home
##Now, if you've seen my home you know that it's a BIG chunk of walls and furniture
##I needed something that would allow decent access speeds at well over 30 feet
##My previous experience has been with a Netgear 54 G series router, and that one kept hanging every few hours
##With this one, however, I haven't had a single drop in the past 20 hours
##The signal strength is 'Excellent' where earlier it could barely manage 'Low' to 'Good
##' Also to be considered is that this is the first router I have set up
##EVER
##Thankfully I didn't have to traverse the maze of acronyms while setting up the device
##I simply followed the steps in the setup wizard and was done setting it up in 15 minutes flat
##I think that's pretty impressive for someone who's never dealt with stuff like PPPoE and all that whiz-bang
##If you were confused about all the routers in the market, and esp
##between this one and the Linksys WRT54GL, my vote goes here because of the future-proofing and the capabilities of this device
[t] seamless downloading
##I have been a faithful Linksys customer for 6 years, but I am very happy with this product
##I often had interrupted or arrested download issues, but since using this product, downloads are fast and seamless
##Easy to set up, but I opted not to install the provided utilities
##I highly recommend this product
[t] Quick and Easy Set-up
##Follow the instructions as provided and you should be operational in about thirty minutes
##I would recommend two things
[t] DIR-655 was a good choice
##The DIR-655 improved my remote wireless connection (about 250 feet) from a weak and unreliabale 1 mbps to a reliable 11 to 18 mbps, not the 54 mbps maximum for my system, but still a great improvement for my circumstances!
[t] Amazing router, worth every penny!
##I've purchased many D-link products and it's usually been hit or miss
##Fortunately, the DIR-655 is one of the best products D-link has ever produced
speed[@]##Setup was simple, and my network speeds surged (as my LAN speed was now 1 Gbps as opposed to 100 Mbps)
internet[@]##Even browsing the internet via direct connection was slightly faster than with my previous G router (DI-624)
##I also purchased a D-link Wireless N MediaBridge to extend my wireless N connection to my basement media room
##Works great with Xbox Live (sign ins are significantly faster and download speeds have tripled)
##Streaming HD content between the upstairs and downstairs computers works great now (stutter-free with NO dropped signals so far)
##I couldn't even attempt this with my previous wireless G setup
##I'm very happy with my purchase and I would highly recommend both the DIR-655 and the wireless N MediaBridge (DAP-1555) for anyone who needs a fast home network
##It works with b/g wireless standards, though I would recommend setting up your existing router in wireless "Access Point" mode for legacy "G" and/or "B" devices and use this router exclusively for "N" devices
##Works great for me
[t] threw the instructions out
##This replaced a 4 year old Linksys router that was dying
##I opened it up and plugged it in, went to the D-Link site with my hard-wired desktop and got the router address and configured it (SSID, WPA, etc
##) in less than 5 minutes
##BEST web-based interface I've ever seen, way better than the Linksys (which wasn't bad)
##my laptop, which supports B, G & N, is flying, my iPhone tied right in and seems faster
##range is great, my Linksys never lost signal but signal would drop off a lot the further away I was
##not so with this router
##tough to find a router with good reviews but I think I've made the right decision
[t] Simple & Effective
##Our construction includes several cement block walls
security[@]##This d-link router is simple to install - including security setup - and has a much wider reach than 802
##11g had, even when using a booster with the older technology
[t] Finally... a wireless router that works... and works...
##I haven't even had to reset this thing since I bought it months ago
##I've been through half a dozen routers and this is the best by far
##Kudos DLink
[t] better than expected
price[@]##Before I settled for the DIR-655 I tested Netgear and Linksys N Standard routers of the same price range for my specific needs
##Both were disappointing
##I have a SOHO environment with b, g and n WLANs, wired Ethernet and power line Ethernet connections
##The SW is all the Windows junk and VMware with more Windows
##The DIR-655 has a very good set of functions to support all this
##The built-in Gigabit adapters and bridge are a charm
##The configuration was very easy and to my amazement the device proofs to be very stable and reliable
##It is in use for about two months now, both in the US and in Europe
##Transmission rates for wired and wireless (N Standard) connections are higher than I had with the other router brands
##I can't say very much about the wireless range though, I didn't run specific tests
##The only thing I don't like so much (besides of the poor look of the box) is that all network adapters have to be defined in the router, not only the wireless but also the wired ones if MAC filtering is used
##Gave me some headache with all the VMware machines
##Bottom line
[t] Quick and easy
##I finally gave up on linksys after replacing parts of my network on an annual basis
##I was surprised at how quickly and painless I was able to set this up and match my previous settings
##All of my wireless devices connected quickly and my hard-wired devices were up and good quickly there after
port[@]##When I was doing the set-up I noticed lots of settings that I will have to explore later on and was surprised to see a USB port on the unit, hopefully I can connect network storage to this device
speed[@]##I use AppleTV and iPhone on the wireless side and those were both moving faster and I look forward to the speed of gigabit network on the hardwire while pushing large files across the network
##Now if I could just get the DSL to step it up I'd be living the entertainment on-line lifestyle
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##This router works very well
##It installed easily and is fast
##So far no problems
[t] Best Router I've Used
##This is the best router I've ever used
##Its been rated highly by many of the PC/technology review sites
##which is the reason I bought it in the first place
##The coverage is definitely better than even the older D-Link routers, and includes a very competent QoS engine
##I tweaked it just a tad, but only because I enjoy playing with things and seeing how they work
##The router worked perfectly right out of the box and I was online within 5 minutes
##My Fiancee's PowerBook G4 had been dropped, and the antenna was damaged
##Before, she couldn't get any signals outside of 25 feet
internet[@]##Now, she is surfing the internet across the house, at much higher speeds than before
[t] One of the BEST routers out there...
##This router is awesome
##I've had it since October 2008
##I use it almost every day with either my Macbook Pro or my iPod Touch
##It has great reception that I can pick up from even outside
##I almost NEVER have connection issues
##The only problem I've had with it is I couldn't figure out how to encrypt my wireless connection easily, but that was my own fault because I failed to read the PDF manual fully about that
##Overall, great product
##I would and will definitely recommend to a friend if they ask
##Pros
[t] Very Configurable Router Complicated to Setup
##I am a techie of sorts, give me any AV system and I can do wonders
##I am very familiar with most routers because every new AV product now a days needs network access
##I do like this router it is very configurable but it is also very complicated to configure
##I have had to spend many hours of fixing issues with connections for this router that my old Airport extreme just did
##This is not a bad thing, but the buyer needs to know this will not be a quick install
##I have two Mac laptops and one PC, a home automation system (Crestron) and a Wii
##I have had issues getting every one of these connections
##or having slow connects
##There are a lot of configurations that need to be taken into consideration
##Also this has not improved my reception any
##I even bought the DWA-652 for my PC and I have had more issues with this slowing down or freezing my PC
[t] Safe wireless, no RFI
##Being a ham radio operator I had to be sure that the wireless router would not interfere with my serious radios
##and it doesn't
##I hear no RF inteference (hash) when the router is busy, sitting about 8 feet from the HF and VHF radios
##And so far the HF radio has had no effect on the router
##Router was easy to install, and once I entered the right DSL password (from my ISP) it was easy to program and get started up
##Range seems to be OK, covering two floors of a concrete house and wihin 50 feet outside
[t] D-Link N Router
##Excellent product
##Easy setup and broad range
##I recommend this product to everyone
price[@][u]##The only downside is the 
##A bit much considering similar products
[t] Wireless coverage disappointing
##I purchased this router for two reasons
[t] Pleasantly surprised
##I was looking for a reasonably-priced wireless router that did 802
port[@]##11n, had a gigabit switch (preferably 4-port, rather than 3 like the AirPort Extreme) and a USB port for an external storage device
##The DIR-655 fit the bill perfectly, though I was leery of D-Link because I had inherited another D-Link wireless 802
##11g router that always required rebooting to connect two of my wireless devices (a Lenovo X61 running Vista and an iPod Touch)--though another laptop (a Toshiba laptop also running Vista) connected consistently
##We have had the router for about a month now and I have never had to reboot it (with the exception of re-configuring it of course)
##The parental controls and logging are very handy
##Wireless coverage is very strong--I walked down the street two houses down and still got a decent signal
##No problem getting a signal in our backyard treehouse or workshop
##My only issue so far
[t] Be aware...NO support for 10Mb devices
##I love every aspect of this router
##However, be warned that a Gigabit switch in D-Link's definition DOES NOT imply 10Mb support
##It will only do 100Mb and 1000Mb
##I just verified this with tech support, who were quite friendly, by the way, and I got through to them immediately
##So even if everyone else in the industry sells a router with a 4-port Gigabit switch that is backwards compatible with slower devices, apparently D-Link does not, at least for this model
##I'll have to knock them 1 star because even their tech support site incorrectly makes the claim of lower 10Mb support
[t] Works great in front of FIOS router
##I only wish I had realized earlier just how poor the ActionTec FIOS router is
##This one gives much, much better wireless performance, even with 802
##11g adapters
[t] Buy this router!!!
##I bought this router about six months ago and have yet to experience any major problems
##It was very easy to set-up and provides a strong signal that is easy to connect to from any device
##I especially like the "guest network" feature that allows visitors to use the router (by pressing the button on the router) without disclosing the password and exposing your network
##I use my router for several devices including laptops, desktops, an IPOD touch, and my Samsung Fascinate (Android smart phone)
##I love this router!
[t] 8 out of 10
##The router looks nice and the setup is fairly simple
##The range is about the same as my old dlink router that has one antena in which I paid only 30$ for
##I was expecting a better range from one antena to three antena but I think the range is hindered due the amount of drywall and air space from the point of reception
##Overall , looks cool and functions well
[t] Works great; needs to include instructions for setting up shareport
##The router works great
speed[@]##Fast speed and pretty far range
##Router is set up on the second floor of a fairly large home and I've had no issues getting a signal anywhere in the house or outside
##Network / wireless setup was very easy
##Just pop the CD in and follow the instructions
##My only complain was that there was literally no information about how to enable the shareport (USB) on the back of the router
##It's not just plug & play; you have to download the Shareport Utility and install it on your computer
##Took a while to find this out online, but all was well once I got that squared away
##I have my external hard drive connected to the shareport and it works just like I had it connected directly to my computer
[t] Beware if you have a NAS
speed[@]##This router was a significant speed upgrade over my previous router but had compatibility issues that resulted in me returning it to Amazon
##I wanted to use my old router as a dedicated wireless G access point and this one for 802
##11N and the other networking
##Connecting the computers to the router was easy and standard
##The problem was with my NAS
##I use my NAS as a media server and backup drive for our computers and also with my Xbox 360
##The computers and the Xbox could not find the NAS on the network
##I have done some searching on the issue and it seems that others have this problem
price[@]##I would rate the router as 3 stars but I took off an extra star for the price because I consider this to be a pretty standard wireless N router
##I replaced the DIR-655 with a TP-Link 300 Mb/s wireless N router
price[@][u]##The TP-Link costs half the  of the D-link and is just as fast according to my benchmarks
##My NAS connected to the computers and Xbox 360 easily and everything is working
price[@]##This router should work fine for people with a different network setup than mine, but why pay more for the D-Link? It seems like they slapped "Extreme" on the box to market to gamers and then raised the price
##One last thing to be aware of
[t] Simply, the BEST!
##I gave this router 5 Stars because it deserves it
##I am not sure who reviewed this before, but I don't get it
##It was SO easy to set up and the reception is GREAT! I orginially had a non-wireless router and replaced it with an inexpensive router due to how much this was at the time and my budget
##But, I had issues with it having to be restarted a lot and figured, time to take the plunge and get a good router
##Turns out, I got a GREAT router
##I use Netflix through a wireless roku box and this work Beautifully
##Streams HD with NO problems
##I had read in a review, that the unit got very HOT! NOT mine, I do have it on its side via the SUPPLIED stand and it's NOT hot at all
##I can't get over the reception
##I also haven't had to "RESTART" it once
##Which sure is nice
streaming[@][u]##IT'S fast too, especially when  HD to my Roku box and when using my laptop simulatiously
##I was impressed with the instrutions and set up
##I did follow them, which entailed installing the disc like stated and following the directions
##Like the commercial says
[t] Much Better!
##Had a 2 year old Cysco Lynksys that was causing my XP and Win7 to continuously report "server not found" when surfing the net
##This fixed EVERYTHING
##Surfing is much faster and sites can be found
##Yay!
[t] Great purchase
##Got it for ~ 70$
internet[@],speed[@]##Good deal to me, supports high speed internet
##Reccomended buy for gamers and streamers of movies
[t] Excellent router
##Bought this to replace my 3 year old Netgear G router
##I have a 2 level concrete house and I used to have issues of two types with my previous router
[t] Great product if you don't use Xbox LIVE
##This is a wonderful router for everything you'd want to do
##except if one of those things is play games on Xbox LIVE
##You experience constant disconnections during any movie streaming, downloading, or multiplayer sessions
##My average play time is about 2 minutes before being disconnected
##I'm familiar with configuring a router, isolating an IP, using the DMZ, setting forwarding
##and none of it in any combination works
##Other net-connected appliances stream just fine, only the Xbox suffers
##I have nothing but great things to say about this router aside from that
security[@][u]##Easy to set up, a great breadth of  and customization features, good wifi coverage
##but it all is for naught when you can't enjoy it fully
[t] Good internet, bad gaming
internet[@][u]##This is a great unit for getting online and using the 
##However, it was marketed as an "excellent" gaming unit, which couldn't be further from the truth, which was why it was purchased and why a 1-star rating
port[@]##I know my way around routers very well, and can adjust settings, use port forwarding, and assign the unit to operate in the DMZ
##I tried using this unit to work with Call of Duty
[t] On and Off inconsistent
##THIS UNIT NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY FROM DAY ONE
##CONSTANTLY DROPPING THE SIGNAL WHILE ONLINE OR STREAMING THE BALLGAME
##WENT BACK TO MY OLD LINKSYS AND NEVER AGAIN LOST A CONNECTION
##WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS UNIT TO ANYONE
[t] Doesn't even come close to living up to what it says it does!
##I have had nothing but problems with this router! It has sucked hours and hours of my time and life away maintaining it! Change the user password and it only remembers the original one! Every tiny change you make to the configuration the router need 15 to 300 seconds to make the change then you still have to wait for Internet to be established again
internet[@],installation[@]##I have wanted to rip it off the wall and stomp on it a few hunred times! It NEVER remembers the password change and or constantly fails so I have had to go days and days without internet because I couldn't get this hunk of plastic to restart! Supposedly a log range router! NO WAY!! The piece of junk cant read thru most items the one the phone company provides can, it does NOT cast or receive the same distance, and we have to constantly maintain all of its features and settings! I have had to have an IT guy over twice to verify the installation and fix whatever problems have suddenly and wihout warnig started again
##I have had to do a complete reboot and reprogram just to make it do simple task it will supposedly do better and faster than any other router! The only thing it has going for it is its looks!!!
[t] Terrible
##I bought this router as an upgrade from my Netgear wireless g router
##As soon as it was installed I started losing connection intermittently and on several occasions couldn't connect at all
##My son has an Xbox and he also was having a lot of issues with the online gaming
##After four days we switched back to the Netgear router and all the previous issues were gone
##This will be my last D-Link purchase
[t] Frustration
##I have this router installed for over a year
##Suddenly, when I begin searching it redirects me to dlink/search
##It would then display, dlink redirect, that redirect did not function
##I could no longer use any search engine
##So , I went to Starbucks, and behold, my laptop could once again use a search engine that would work
##At Starbuks, I found that Dlink (they deny this) are using increased bandwidth to redirect to search their site and collect revenue as a referal fee
##I found the fix thanks to others who had the same issues
##Dlink denies they do this
speed[@]##I applied the fix, it worked immediately, my speed increased noticably
##I have always used Dlink products, but, this is my last one
##I know there will be others that will agree and stop using their products
##This took in total about 4 hours out of my day
price[@]##If I were to ask for paid support, what would that of cost, more than the price of the router
##The time is one thing, frustration cost more
##For sure, this is a sign of a company that is revenue hungry, not, customer friendly
##This should be disclosed, it is dishonest
##A sign of a company that may be financially struggling, grasping at the last straws of to create revenue
price[@][u]##Perhaps, that will soon be reflected in their stock  too
[t] Wireless Router
##Good router
##Installed easily
##It's been operating for some time
##I am now thinking of upgrading to an even newer model of D-Link
##Maybe one of the dual band models
[t] I love D link
##This is my second d link and works great
##Tried a different brand through Amazon and took it back within a week and went back to D link just upgraded to this router love it best in towm
[t] Router
##It was exactly what I ordered! A nice router for the price, I have one at home and was replacing a different router for my mother
[t] Signal drops almost once a week
##This is worst wireless router I have owned
##I got it about 2 months ago since than I had to reset it almost once a week because all of sudden signal drops
##If you already own this piece of s*** router the problem is signal mode
##Try to manually change G&N; or only N mode
##emailed D-Link and no response
##Don't buy D-Link DIR-655 N+300 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router
[t] Perfect!!
##Fast shipping and it has been working great!!! I would highly recommend this product to any one looking for a Wi Fi
[t] Very satisfied have 2 one up north and one in the south, no problems working well.
##I have one unit up north and loved it, working goooood
##I did not remember to take it south for the winter, had to purchase a second one
[t] Frustration
##Be prepared for an aggrevating setup
##It does seem to work as advertised, even the shareport
##The LAN connection is very fast, I donot have my "n" WLAN card yet, so I cannot comment
security[@]##I had to manually set the security key in Windows to get connected
##I guess this maybe a windows issue, but my old zxytel must have done this on its own
##Whatever
##My blood pressure has returned to normal and the 655 has avoided the hammer, atleast for now
[t] Easy to install
##I was so scare to install it due to the fact that I am no techy but -- very easy to do
##I had it up and running in less than 1 hour
##I was so very proud of myself and so proud that I purchased this router
##I highly recommend it
[t] Not worth the money if not using N mode
##I bought this router a few months ok wanting to upgrade from the basic Linksys wireless router
##I thought I would be able to get N mode working but found out that no game consoles use it and you need the N adapter which costs just as much as the router so I couldn't use that mode for any of my computers
##After connecting it, and optimizing it to the best performance I could get working which was just the next one under Extreme N mode, I got the same results as the Linksys router
##No difference what so ever
##So I resorted to just going wired
##To make your computer N compatible, it will cost you close to $200 for the adapter and this router
##So unless you want to spend the money for it, go for it, it will be better but its only limited to whats N mode ready
##If you're not gonna use N mode, then skip this and just go with the Linksys wirless basic router
##You'll get the same performance
##This router is not worth the money if you're not already N compatible
[t] Only complaint ##The title does say it all
##best dlink router ive tried yet
##upgrade from 624 and any problems i ever had with that disappeared
##roommate put a strip of electrical tape over the lights to dampen their radiance
##"wont u not be able to see the signal lights on the front of the router?" no, u wont, but it doesnt screw up much at all, so there has been no need for it
[t] quick and easy
##this product delivers everything it promises
##had network up and running in 15 minutes
##delivers signals throughout house including basement, second floor, and outside deck
[t] Great router, easy setup
##The router set up very easily once I stopped following the instructions and simply plugged it into my network
speed[@][u]##The wireless runs very well at high  with excellent range throughout our house
##I also have two CAT5 wired workstations on the router and they run faster than they did with my old router
[t] Didn't work for me, but might for you
##I don't think this is a problem that everyone needs to worry about, but one of my PC's on my network is my company laptop, and I use it to log on to the corporate VPN and access applications on my company's network
##When connected to this Router either through one of the ethernet connections or wirelessly, I could not connect to the VPN
##I tried calling the Dlink support line, but the things they told me to try did not help with the problem
internet[@]##Accessing the internet was not a problem, so it would have been fine if I did not need a more complete solution
##After 2 weeks of trying different things, some suggested by my company's network folks, I decided to take advantage of Amazon's return policy
##I think there was something about this router that was just not compatible with what I needed it to do
##I reconfigured my old wired Linksys Router, which allowed the VPN connection, no problems, and did some research on the internet, decided to add a Wireless Access Point (linksys) to my existing wired router, again ordered from Amazon, should I need to return it
##But no need
##It works great, took about 10 minutes to setup, and no problems getting to the VPN, and we finally have the option to connect wirelessly, which also works great
##So, if at first you don't succeed, try, try, again
[t] Wish I had FiOS already
##This router is amazing
internet[@]##Only downside is my internet connection
##If you have the cash
##buy it
[t] Fast but tedious set-up
speed[@]##I got this to keep the gigabit speed of my network between two switches (D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop Switch)
##It works great once you get past the initial set-up
##I tried logging in directly to it using the IP it comes with (192
##168
##0
##1) and it would not let me do it
##Then I had to run the wizard a few times on a windows machine to get it to let me configure it manually
##Other than that, it works great
##I wish it had markers on the switch side that lets you know what connections are running at 1000 mbps like their switches do
##And it does run a bit warm
[t] GREAT PRODUCT !!
##I purchased this item for my husband
##He was very pleased with it and said it was very easy to set up, worked perfectly after the set up and would recommend it to anyone
##Great price, quick delivery easy to set up
##What more could you ask for!!
[t] Did not increase range over a Belkin 80211G unit
##I purchased this device (80211n) to replace a Belkin 80211g unit, thinking that it would enhance my range
##I experienced no increased coverage and decided to return the unit
[t] Works as designed
##Product works as designed, no reboots as with other routers
##has been up for 30 days without issue
##Speeds are excellent although N is not as fast as I thought it would be but coverage is better than G
##Using it both wired and wireless and everything works as advertised
[t] Installation and Support Needs Improvement
##The router works fine, although I see little improvement over the Linksys router this one replaced
installation[@][u]##I don't know much about router setup so when the automatic  failed to work I needed help
##Good luck with that
##Contacting support wasn't easy and sometimes I couldn't get through
##It took me several days and several techs to finally get the router to work
internet[@]##I get my internet from a small, rural provider who uses a static IP address
installation[@]##The installation disc and each tech I spoke with just assumes a dynamic IP address
##Somewhere in the diagnostic process you'd think someone would ask the static/dynamic question
##This router did not ship with the driver version it needed and you need to make a support call or search D-Link's knowledgebase to find this little tidbit
##Since being installed a couple months ago, the router has been working fine
[t] great router
##this d-link-655 extreme n wireless router go great with my playstation 3
##when i download demo
[t] great product
##It was easy to install and it works great were very happy with it
[t] Was a great router prior to the firmware update.
##I loved this router till I upgraded the firmware to 1
##31
##After the upgrade, I have frequently had to cycle the power to get the router to work correctly
##If you upgrade the firmware, you can't go back to versions prior to 1
##31
##The latest version has helped somewhat, but I still have to cycle the power a couple of times a week
##If they get this problem fixed, then I will be happy
##When working, the router is fast and the range is great
##I keep the router in my basement near my server and I can get a strong signal anywhere on my property
##(7700 sqft lot with a 1850 sqft ranch house with full basement) I don't have any portable devices that use n yet, but my g devices all get strong signals now
[t] Works well
##I replaced an older router that stopped working
##I found this router very easy to set up
speed[@]##The speed and wireless signal have been great
##I would definitely buy it again
[t] Disappointed with signal strength
##Set-up worked fine with Vista, some issues with XP computer
##Phoned tech support to work around issue
##Disappointed with signal strength in kitchen
##We're talking, basement to main level 50 feet
##This is only one wall, maybe fireplace and floor, unless ceramic tile interferes with signal
[t] Wireless signal a bit weak
##Upgraded from Linksys G to this one primarily for the N and Gigabit ports
##Manual setup is easy enough
security[@]##I kept the SSID and security the same as before, all devices on my network work just fine including PS3, Macs, Blu-ray players, PC etc
##Except the wireless signal seems weaker than the Linksys G router
##The placement location is same as before
##iPhone went from 3 bars to 1-2 bars
##Works but weaker
##Same goes for the signal strength meter on the Thinkpad
##My wireless printer works fine, so that's good
##May be D-Link makes a signal booster?The antenna extension is a joke
##4 feet that's all !?They really should make the extension powered with a 25' cable
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##I bought this router based on claims that it was among the best for extended range coverage
##My previous router was an inexpensive Linksys G router
##It was easy to set up and instructions were clear for getting maximum range performance
internet[@]##My intent was to set this router up in my neighbor's house and share his internet
installation[@]##I was disappointed to find that this router performed no better in range than my Linksys, and that I could get no signal from an installation in the neighbor's house about 200 feet away from my computer
##If I took my computer within 60 feet of the neighbor's house I got reasonable signal
##It works as advertised when installed in my house where my computers are within 40 feet of the router
##So, if you are looking for max range from a N router, this isn't the one
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
[t] great value
##The biggest pain is that the setup wizard on the disk only works on windows machines
##But customer service was friendly and helpful on setting it up manually on a mac/linux machine
[t] Great SWITCH TOO!
##I started out using this as my primary router
##Soon, had a service change with ATT Uverse and have to use their 2Wire router
##I ended up taking this Dlink to the opposite end of the house, hard wiring into one of the 4 LAN ports and using it as a switch in my media room
##I also set it up as a secondary wireless hub with a WEP for an older Yamaha piano that only accepts WEP format for wireless
##I had no issues with using it, programming it, or signal
##Its a great router
##My previous Dlink was failing intermittently
##I think they do have heat issues, but what ya gonna do
##To use it as a switch, you have to disable DHCP, UPnP, TelNet, and fix the ip address in your other router
port[@]##DONT use the Ethernet port
port[@]##Only the LAN port
##There are a few threads on how to do it out there
[t] Good replacement
##Replaced my old Linksys G router with this Dir -655 at the same location
##Same placement yielded a better signal throughout the house
##Setup was easy thanks to CD
##Unit runs cooler than previous Linksys G - I removed the clear plastic stick-on covering that would otherwise stop up the cooling holes and cause overheating
##Glad I upgraded
[t] DIR-655 Good To Go For 360 and Netflix
##I had an older netgear that worked perfectly fine until I moved to a new home (go figure)
##So I came to Amazon looking for a decent priced N router that was compatible with Xbox Live
##This router does the trick just fine
##Finally get constant HD signal while watching Netflix (my connection is 12MBps) and while playing Xbox Live the connection is great, but of course that depends on the host as well
##Notes
[t] D-Link DIR655 does not disappoint!
##I've been Buying D-Link products for a long time
##This is actually the second DIR-655 that I have purchased
speed[@]##Bought one for my Son In Law to use in his new place and was so impressed with the speed and range, that I bought one for my new place
speed[@]##Easy to setup, great feature set (especially the gigabit ports), and outstanding range are good features, but the speed of the 802
##11N wireless is awesome
##Even my television likes it, connecting to Netflix and downloading instant shows is almost too easy
##I would strongly recommend this router
[t] works well
##No issues so far
port[@]##coverage better than my previous router Level One wbr-6001yet to test network shared drive using usb port
[t] This router works great!
##My old router was dropping the signal at least four or five times a day
##This one is very reliable, no drops so far
##It is very fast and was very easy to set up
price[@]##A great product for the price
[t] Great router... while it lasted.
##I ordered this router less than a month ago
##It was easy to setup and the range is great, but as of yesterday it has completely stopped broadcasting a signal
##At first I was able to reset it and everything would be fine but now it has flaked out completely
##While I usually love D-Link, I seriously doubt I will order another
[t] Ugly
security[@]##I must say that when I saw how complicated the configuration of this device was I thought that I would get a lot of advanced security features
security[@][u]##Unfortunately there are some significant  pieces missing
##Cons
[t] Beware new "B" hardware
##My friend has this router and raves about it, so I got one, hoping to use the same features he uses
##Unfortunately, I found out that my friend got his a couple years ago when D-Link was still making hardware version "A
##" Now they're making hardware version "B" at half the price, and, I believe, half the quality
##The first problem was that the router did not install according to instructions, so I had to improvise
port[@]##Then every feature I attempted to enable - email notifications, access control, sending logs to a server, port triggers, and more - did not work
##Then the wireless signal started failing, and would only come back to full strength for a short while after turning the router off and back on
##I had a lengthy call with tech support where they had me upgrade the firmware, change settings, do hard resets, to no avail
##They finally declared the unit defective and told me to replace it
##So I got a second one
##This one installed according to instructions, but again, none of the features that I tried worked
##I did all the same "fixes" tech support had suggested the first time, and they didn't help
##So I contacted tech support again
##This time they weren't sure what to suggest
##When I asked if the B hardware was indeed cheaper and defective, they hung up on me and now won't respond to my emails or talk to me once they find out what case I'm calling about
##If you can find a used hardware version A somewhere, fine
##Otherwise, do not buy this router for anything other than basic wireless signal, which may stop functioning after a week
[t] router easy to set up
##The D-link router was very easy to set up and works just like it says
[t] Installer does not run
##I received this router today and it is going right back to Amazon
##The install CD does not work
##I have read that other people have had the same problem
##It does not Autorun and you cannot even open the file by trying to run it manually
##I copied the whole CD also and tried to run the exe file that way
##It does not run
##I looked at the web-site for a downloadable install file and there is not one there
##So this was just a huge waste of my time
##I'm going back to Linksys
##Much more reliable!
[t] Horrible tech support
##Purchased this router and just returned it after a horrible tech support experience
##Opened the box, learned that the setup wizard is for Windows users only
##I'm a Mac user
##I read the printed manual provided on the setup disk, but it wasn't very helpful
##I called tech support, waited on hold for about 20 minutes, was then connected to a guy who tried to help me, without success, for about 15 minutes, at which point he said I'd have to call back because there was a 15-minute time limit on tech support calls
##When I blew a gasket about that statement, he said he'd connect me to a level 2 support technician, but I was disconnected before that happened
##I called back, waited on hold for another 20 minutes or so, gave the guy who answered the call my case number
##He said he'd pass me to a level 2 support technician
##I was eventually connected to one, and he got the router to work with one of our computers, but not my G4 PowerBook
##At that point, I'd spent about two hours dealing with setting up the router, and I don't have time to keep messing with it
##I'll likely pay the extra dollars for an AirPort router
##In subsequent correspondence, D-Link said that there isn't a 15-minute time limit on tech support calls, but that's what the first guy I talked to said
##So who knows what's true
##Amazon made it easy to return, for which I'm grateful, but I don't have much good to say about D-Link
##PowerBook users should be extra careful
##Update (2/21/2009)
[t] limited mac filtering and static ip reservation
##I currently have the DIR-655
security[@][u]##Using MAC address filtering, and with it being turned ON, I can only input a maximum of 24 wired/wireless MAC addresses, to allow access to the router (for  purposes)
##I have more wired and wirelesss devices (+ friends' and guest's devices) than the DIR-655 could handle
##Also, the DHCP reservation list is maxed out to 21 IP addresses
##It could probably handle (not sure about this) more MAC addresses if the MAC address filtering is turned OFF, and more IP addresses if set to Dynamic DHCP
##There hasn't been any firmware upgrade to handle this shortcoming
##DIR-855 has this same shortcoming, and am not upgrading to it
##I will look for another brand that does not have these limitations
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router GREAT
##Purchased this router to replace an older B router which was giving me problems both with my wired PC and wireless laptop connections
##The unit exceeded my expectations
##It was easy to setup and its operation was and still is extreemely stable
##Some reviewers complained about the unit running hot
##not mine
##It is not any hotter than the other routers I had before
##Perhaps even somewhat cooler
##The range
[t] Warning for Network Printer Users - Don't Buy This!
##This is the 2nd D-link Networking Product I've purchased in the last several years and it was a big mistake again
##The D-Link DIR-655 has a networking glitch that caused me major frustration to troubleshoot and finally just plain didn't work (just like the WiFi Webcam I purchased a few years ago)
##If you have a printer with built-in Ethernet networking, steer clear of this product
##I plugged my printer's Ethernet cable directly into one of the router LAN ports, configured all settings as I have with 2 previous WiFi Routers (Linksys and SMC), and while the printer appeared on the network (responds to some IP address pings), none of my wired or wireless computers could print due to communications errors
##I called D-Link support, and gosh were they horribly clueless
##They forced me to speak to 3 different Level 1 support techs even though I asked for a more senior tech support rep (because they kept asking me to do really dumb things to troubleshoot, and I clearly knew more networking basics than they did)
##I then got run through two Level 2 reps, at which point they gave up and told me to call in the next day for a L3 tech
##I call in, ask for a L3 tech, get put on hold for 45+ mins (when they told me it would take 2-3 minutes), and then a rep picks up saying "L2 support"
##I explain to the L2 supervisor that I need a L3 rep, and after another 15 min hold, I finally get to a L3 tech who tries to troubleshoot, but is stumped as well and admits that "not many people who use their router have network-capable printers"
##Somehow that is supposed to excuse how their product cannot seem to handle simple peer-to-peer 10/100 Ethernet networking?Oh, and by the way, the main reason I got this product was to see if it would have better range and signal strength than my Linksys WRT54GS
##and it didn't
##Still only 2 bars in my kitchen less than 50 ft away
##I'm returning it today, and in the future, I'm avoiding D-link products like the plague
[t] complicated install
##i was unable to establish a connection after following all the onscreen instructions
##i called d-link support and spent an hour with a technician, who talked me through a difficult process
internet[@][u]##i had  connection for one day before losing signal
##another hour on the phone and two more technicians later, i was able to acquire a connection
internet[@]##my router is located about 40 feet from my customary notebook work area and i have frequently been unable to access internet through the wireless and had to use the desktop
##d-link dir 655 "extreme" n wireless router is definitely "extreme"ly difficult
[t] Recommended Product
##I bought this as an upgrade
##I was a little concerned because some of the reviews made it sound hard to install and I'm no tech wizard
##Following the directions made the install easy
##Getting to the right place to secure the network took a little more effort
##I downloaded "Network Magic" as recommended, but uninstalled it after a couple of days
##The Windows networking product works fine for me
[t] D-Link DIR-655 wireless router
##The item itself is great and does everything as advertised
##The one received from Amazon
##com was defective and took one hour on the phone with D-Link to determine that it was defective
##To Amazon's credit it was easy to return
[t] What a waste of money!
##purchased this router few months ago to connect 2 iMacs, 1 Mac Mini, 1 MacBook Pro, 1 Dell Precision 690, 1 Sony Vaio, PS3, XBox 360, iPod Touch, Linksys iPhone and Panasonic Skype Phone
##All good for few months
##Then, the panasonic skype phone started to refuse to connect to my network, constantly got disconnection problems, random reset of the router, etc
##After all those troubles I purchased an Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station
##ALL the problems solved
##Yes, it costs almost twice, but believe me, the apple performed super well compared with this piece of garbage
##I'm very disappointed with the D-Link 655 router and now it's far away on the closet, don't have soul to put 100 bucks on the trash, but it is where this thing belongs to
##Have the warning
##this thing will give you some troubles in the long term, also, the setup is just horrible compared with old routers from d-link, not counting the too brilliant blue leds that are very disturbing in a dark room and the poor wi-fi range
##I'm purchasing my second Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station to increase the signal and cover all my property
[t] Bang for the buck
##I bought this to replace a Linksys wireless router that I had
##That router was not able to handle two xboxs and three computers
installation[@]##Since receiving this router I have had zero issues and installation was a breeze
##I would recommend this router to anyone with increased band with demands
[t] Good product at a fair price
##I have owned this product for 1 year
##I have been pleased with its wireless range
##The router sits in the basement and most of the mobile devices are on the second story on the opposite side of the house
##The wireless devices receive at least 3 out of 5 bars at that distance
port[@]##I do have to reset the router every so often because it will lose its ability to print using the USB port
##Since I have been pleased with the rouer I just purchased it for my parents
[t] Reliable device so far
##I have owned this product for more than one year - so far so good
##Solid connections, very reliable, blue lights are bright - but they do not bother me, just cover them or turned them around
##Heat is not a problem on my device - keep all sides of the device and you will not get it hot as other reviewers mentioned
##Will buy again
[t] My favorite router, but I'm fairly simple
##I've had this router for 2-3 years
##I've went through 3-4 firmware updates and I think I'm at 34B now
##Right now it needs a reboot every 6-8 months, and most of those are probably me needing to reboot my ComCast box
##It has a powerful signal
##In the middle of a 3 story house you'll probably get 4-5 bars anyplace inside
##I only have a WII and 1 computer and the wife's cell phone on it's wireless
##My other 3 computers are on it's Gigabit wired
internet[@],security[@]##I put in a home security DVR the other day and it's Port Forwarding worked great so I can view my cameras from anything on the internet
##It's USB hard drive and printer sharing are fairly painful and I consider them gimmicks
speed[@]##It supports Jumbo Frames so you get very good speed on it's wired jacks
##No problems at all
##I like it's Web Site Filter for filtering Wizard 101 game for my 5 year old
##He only gets to play it when there is no school the next day
[t] Can't beat it for the price
##I've owned this for a couple weeks now and I feel comfortable writing a review about it now
##We replaced a POS Netgear WGR614Netgear WGR614 Wireless-G Routerwith this D-Link router
speed[@]##I read a lot of reviews and decided on this one for the price, speed and of course the good reviews
##It came with an install CD, which for some reason (I'm guessing because it had stopped working again) didn't detect my old router
##It wants you to leave your old router hooked up so it can detect the settings and transfer them over for you
##I gave up on that and did a manual install which was easy as pie, for me anyway
speed[@][u]##This router shot my  up another 10mbps when I hooked it up
##I got my brother a cheap wireless adapter like this one ->TP-Link TL-WN721N 150Mbps Wireless N USB Adapterbut cheaper
port[@]##We installed that one upstairs on the other side of the house and it was giving him about 120mbps which isn't bad at all!We also have a server that my brother wanted connected to the router with port forwarding
##This is where it got to be a bit of a headache
##He had gone in and changed the settings on it when I was working one day
internet[@]##When I came back, we could not access the internet or the router for more than 10 seconds
##We did a couple resets on it to get it working again
##I have no idea what he did to it
##He also caused my computer not to have access to the HDD (insert boot disk error)
##I got upset about it and tried to fix it on my own
##When I get upset, I get confused
##I ended up calling tech support at about 10pm MST
##I had to hold for about 5 minutes and got some guy in India of course
##He was really nice and knowledgeable
##He got me to check the firmware which was slightly out of date (2
##00NA compared to 2
##03NA)
##I downloaded the firmware and updated it
port[@]##Then we went on to setup port forwarding
##Port forwarding was setup a little weird
##You can only select games as the application
##You can't select a computer which is what we were trying to do
##We went to Virtual Server and found the option to select a computer there
##I only found mine at the time
##I could access the server via the internal IP address but not externally
##I asked him if he had reset the server since he had been working on it
##I should have done that to begin with
internet[@]##Once I reset the internet adapter, the server immediately showed up on the Virtual Server list
##I installed it and we were able to access it externally
internet[@]##I told him to reset his 3 other computers that had no internet access
##They all worked after that and have been since then
##+
[t] Easy to setup, great router
##Got this after my last router died
##It had a straight forward setup
##Took it out of box, made necessary connections and it was ready to use
##The admin UI is a little complex to use
##But I was able to find my way around it after a little time
##It was easy to setup a secure wireless network
##Haven't faced any issues so far
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router (Personal Computers)
price[@]##I recently switched from CenturyLink Internet and phone service as they would not give the same price they were advertizing on TV for 'New' customers
internet[@]##I switched to CableOne 50 Mbps internet with Ooma telephone service
##The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router (Personal Computers) was the router of choice
price[@]##The Amazon price was good
##($30
##00 less than local merchants) It was the right choice for what I needed
internet[@],price[@],speed[@]##Now I have super high speed internet with great in home wireless and great phone service for the price of taxes (currently $3
##47 in Idaho)and unlimited nationwide calling, etc
##The D-Link Router compliments these services very well
##The Amazon service was very good
##The product arrived on time and in a few minutes was up and running
##Thank you Amazon!
[t] Flaky product, incomplete customer service response
##Initially, this product worked
##After an interruption of Comcast service about a week and a half into using it, the trouble began
##It was up
##Then it was down
##Then the wireless networking worked but the wired networking failed
##Then it worked
##BOOM
##Down again
##After three hours of troubleshooting on my own, I contacted customer service
##The rep patiently worked with me
##We updated firmware
##We got things mostly working
##BOOM
##Down again
##Two hours on the phone became three
##We ran out the battery on my laptop, and plugged in to keep going
##Finally, the rep concluded that there was a problem with the hardware
##They sent me an RMA number
##At my expense, I could send this busted unit back to them for a replacement
##if I still had the packaging
##and if I could use my (network) printer to generate the label they require
##How cheap can you get??? They cost me and themselves all this time, did a great job working with me on the phone and then drop the ball at the stage where they could make it right? Disappointing
[t] Piece of Junk!
##Paid like $150 bucks for this thing when it first came out
internet[@]##Drops internet every day with this device
##Updated firmware and went through hours of troubleshooting with D-Links horrible customer service
##They still would not give me an RMA
##They kept wanting me to call them back in a week to check in
##I jumped through D-Links hoops many times and they still wouldn't give me an RMA
##not doing it again! I explained that I do IT for a living and that in the amount of time I spent on the phone with them I could have paid for 2 of these devices and I was still unable to return mine
[t] Fast, Smart, but hot and inconsistent
internet[@]##In my house, this is the router that we use to connect our Cable internet ~2 mb/s) to 6 wireless computers
##Overall, performance has been excellent, but there have been some hiccups and overheating issues
##Some positives* Range is very good
##The six computers in the house have tested the range to up to about 25-40 feet
##Generally, range is strong
##** QoS (Quality of Service) is a very nice feature that let's you surf the internet, voice call, etc
##with a smoother experience
internet[@]##For example, when I'm doing some heavy gaming, the gaming takes priority over other internet surfing activities like downloading
##I rarely have any slowdown while I'm gaming
##*** Router account control
##Through any computer in the network, you may setup rules, policies, passwords, as well as monitor how much data certain computers are using
##Some drawbacks* The Light is quite bright
##There are several bright blue lights that flash consistently, but that could be solved with a simple covering of a piece of paper, etc
##** Overheating is a prevalent problem
##Whether it's cool or warm, this router overheats like nothing I've ever seen
##We relieved this problem by elevating it on some cardboard pillars
##Ventilation is key to keeping this router running smoothly, which this router unfortunately doesn't address very well
internet[@]##Occasionally, internet will be disconnected because overheating is a common disruption
internet[@]##Overall, this router has good performance, features, and intelligent internet surfing
##However, be wary of overheating that comes with this product
[t] Great Potential
##I had high hopes
##First the likes
[t] Seems to work as expected, but no real noticeable increase in speed...
security[@][u]##The router works as expected with  features that my previous router didn't have
##I am unable to determine if there was an increase in speed, but I am happy with the purchase
[t] Literally 1000x better than Linksys
##I used to have a Linksys wireless router and it would drop me so often I became enraged and bought one of these out of pure hatred for Linksys
##It turns out D-Link was so much better and I have been so much better off with it I can't even believe it like for real
##I don't know if it's the extra antennae or what but it only drops me under extreme circumstances like if I'm too far away or if I'm 3 rooms away surrounded by interference it's great
##Plus it's white and so is my Wii and that's like the only thing I like about my Wii, which is awful
##Because like Macintosh products things are just cooler in white, I don't know what it is
##I've currently got about 7 devices connected to it and there are no problems with the device itself, though every now and then the connection to the modem may become unstable due to a loose wire, and I always feel so bad after spending hours fretting just to find out a wire was loose
##Anyway it's Great/10
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##This wireless router works about the same as other wireless routers I have used
##I am not please, however, because it was said to give a greater distance and does not
##If anything, the distance for reception is shorter than my older Netgear two antenae wireless router
##I get about 100 feet max out of this router
##If that is what you want, then it works well
##If you want further reception - I need about 150 feet - then you need to looks
[t] REPLACED TWICE IN A MONTH! **AVOID**
##I got this router and am just plain disappointed
##Replaced TWICE!! Ready to give up on it
port[@]##The sharing of the USB port Wi-Fi is spotty at best
##Portable HDD didn't work, printer seldom
##I DO NOT RECOMMEND! I like D-Link but so disappointed
##Mike
[t] Very Pleased
##I am not a computer guy by any means but this device seems to work great and was very easy to set up
##I have no complaints about this purchase and would recommend it to anyone
[t] D-Link Tech Support SUCKS!
##I purchased this D-Link DIR-655 because of the high ratings it got, both on shopper sites as well as technical review sites
##Three weeks after installing this router, the wired section stopped working
internet[@]##My desktop computer could not get out on the internet
internet[@]##The wireless section still worked, as I could access the internet with my iPhone through the wifi section
internet[@]##D-Link tech support put me through hell for nearly an hour, plugging and unplugging everything in my system, even though I told them that my desktop could access the internet just fine when plugged in to the DSL modem directly, but not through their router
speed[@]##After being passed on to a "higher level" technician, the final so-called solution to the immediate problem was to change the DNS address of the router, which allowed me to access the internet, albeit painfully slow (less than 5kb/sec download speed as opposed to the 5Mb/sec it use to be when I bought it
##Bottom line is this
[t] Died After 5 Weeks
##Not sure what happened
##I am not a tech guru but I am not a newbie either
##Just FYI
##I am stuck buying a new router because spending hours on the phone with tech support or taking time to ship there and back and blah blah blah, is not worth the time
##I hope mine was a fluke
[t] Great features, but its no cigar
##This router comes packed with features and promise
##For them to fulful several things have to come together perfectly, and in most cases they wont
##- Setting up the router was more painful than I thought- Mixed n and g signals are less powerful than just g, but you can configure something neat here
[t] Great Product!!
##I am very happy with this product
##Works exactly as described
speed[@]##Pretty good speed and great connectivity
##It gave me what I expected from a router
[t] Worth every cent.
##I bought this router to replace an old netgear wireless G unit
##I had to set it up manually because we use netbooks and don't have an external drive yet
##The manual setup is anything but straightforward
##If you don't know anything about computers or networking I don't recommend manual setup
##If you're plugging in to a gateway you may need to change the routers address
##After that it was fairly easy
##Speed
[t] wireless at granny's house
##I ordered this unit to add wireless to existing service
##I set it up in about 10 minutes with no glitches
##The bright lights are problematic as I set the unit up in a small bedroom where I sleep
##I cover it before I go to bed
##However, a small trade off for such a great router
[t] Nice unit - replaced an old linksys
software[@]##I originally bought a Belkin, but ran into tons of problems with poor software and worse support
##So I took it back
##With this unit Tried using the guided setup, but it failed, so I just did it the old fashioned way
##So much for intelligent setups!Once setup it has worked fine
##One hint, I have DSL and the default for PPoe on ths is to disconnect after 5 minutes of non-use, just set it to not disconnect
[t] D-Link still the best
##I owned an old D-Link 614 router for more than 5 years with no issues
##Last year I decided it was time to upgrade
##I asked for the DIR-655 for Christmas and got it
##It's been almost a year now and no issues at all
##Very reliable and much better reception than my old 614
##I think that this is such a great value that I replaced my family's router for one of these a month ago
[t] Shareport doesnt work on the latest Mac OS X version
##External antennae aren't any better than comparable internal antennae models
##Shareport application is not available as a download for MAC OS X Snow Leopard
##I e-mailed customer support about this issue and NEVER heard a response back
##I searched the user support forums and found several threads of shareport not available for the latest MAC OS version (10
##6), although available for OLDER versions
##Since my primary reason of interest in upgrading to this newer router was the shareport feature, the fact that it is not compatible with my MAC prompted me to return the product
[t] great router
##easy setup and better reception then my linksys i replaced so far no lost connections either that is why i replaced my linksys router
[t] Reviews where spot on!
##Dlink delivered, the product works well with modem 3
##0, we play on playstation 3 online while the wii and two computers are sreaming netflix
[t] Piece of Junk
##I ordered this with high hopes
speed[@]##I was to be replacing a perfectly working Linksys WRT54GL basically for the speed and increased reception
##Out of the box everything went smoothly at first
##My first impression of the router config page was not good
##It looks like a jumbled mess comparing to the simplicity of my Linksys
##Everything was connected including 2 laptops, 3 phones, 2 WDTVs, Bluray player, and X360
##Everything worked at first and then I noticed in the evening all my connections dropped
##I said, hey this is a new router, I'm gonna give it a chance, nothing is perfect
##I changed my wireless channel and a few other settings hoping it was a fluke
##Reconnected everything all was well again
##until the next day
##all devices dropped connection once again and once again I had to reset the router
##This time I did a factory reset and did a manual setup since i have a decent amount of experience with routers being a PC Tech
##So
##dropped connection again
##now I'm getting disgusted
##I call Dlink
##tech support was nice and the wait wasn't too long
##The rep had me download the same version firmware I was already running and had me reupload the firmware, then do a factory reset
##Didn't help
##I called back again the next day and she had me change a lot of settings
##about 15 to be exact
##More dropped connections and now it wouldn't connect to my WDTVs or my Bluray player
##she had me run a couple tests and said the router was faulty
##and back it went to Amazon
##I shouldn't have to go through hell and high water to get a router working like it's supposed to
##I did not notice any heat problems or anything as some other users reported
##hey at least your works right? =) I hooked my WRT54GL "Molasses Edition" back up and away we sailed on our wireless G network in less than a minute and no disconnects
##I'll look into these N routers again in the future and maybe give one a try
speed[@]##Oh I will say the speed of this router was fantastic when it felt like working
##I had a Dlink a few years ago and it worked fine but it seems so many of the N routers have quirks in one way or another
##Hope the rest of you have better luck =) I won't be getting a Dlink tattoo anytime soon
[t] D-Link N 1Gb Router
##Home setup at home for 4 Mac Computers-using it with ethernet cables and wireless
internet[@]##Works great and has improved our access to the internet with faster speeds and no dropouts
antennas[@][u]##The routers 3  have extended our reception range
[t] Great Product - Terrible setup documentation
##The setup CD & documentation were terrible, and wrong
##Had to call customer service and spent over an hour getting this setup
##If the documentation would have been correct or the install CD would have worked (it was worthless) it should have been a 10 minute process
[t] Great router, ridiculous lights
##Router is great and blows my previous Linksys out of the water
##Its web interface is extremely well-done
##I'll skip the technical details, as more in-depth technical reviews of the DIR-655 can be found elsewhere online
##HOWEVER
##none of the reviews I read prior to my purchasing of the DIR-655 mentionned anything about the lights
##The STUPID, ridiculous lights
##You see the indicators on the front panel? They're blue LEDs (yes, blue, not green -- the picture is misleading)
##But they're *BRIGHT* blue LEDs
##The thing lights up like a christmas tree
##Looking straight into it will actually blind you
##You *will* have to hide this router in a closet or somewhere where its lights won't shine in your computer room
##Seriously -- I can turn off all the lights and screen in my computer den, and can still read a book from anywhere in the room just by the router's light
##And it's sitting UNDER A DESK
##Also, notice how the light indicators are little icons? I thought that was really neat -- have a little lit computer icon, wireless icon, "internet" icon
##well guess what -- the LEDs are so ridiculously bright that the icon disappears in a giant blue blur
##since the LED is actually strong enough to shine through the white plastic casing
##One more absolutely ridiculous LED-related "feature" -- one of the indicator's only purpose is to blink on and off when the router is "ready" (that's how they describe it in the manual)
##So one of the LEDs blinks on and off every second, for absolutely no reason
##Always
##Forever
##On
##Off
##On
##Off
##As soon as you plug it in
##Extremely irritating and distracting
##One last issue I encountered -- after upgrading the firmware, the router's web interface became wonky
[t] 2 1/2 years in now and still very happy with this router.
##I've been through quite a few routers over the years
##They all tend to get flaky about two years out
##By flaky I mean dropping out, slowing down and needing resets etc
##When this becomes frequent
##it's time for a new router
##I've had the issue with Belkin, Linksys and D-link in the past
##Purchased this one in May of 2009 based on almost universally good reviews across pc mags, users etc
##It has delivered on all fronts, speed, range, features
##and gigabit lan ports to boot
##This last item has been an important feature to me as I have the lan ports feeding 8-port switches -D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop Switch- in several locations throughout the home forming a gigabit lan network throughout
streaming[@][u]##Great if you are moving data volume around,  video, gaming etc
speed[@]##It has all performed to my expectations while delivering excellent wireless speed and range
##Now, two and a half years later, it still delivers
##And it has been put through the paces throughout
##Highly recommended
[t] Good Router but USB port doesn't work
##This is replacing a Netgear WNR3500
##Worked right out of the box, simple setup
##Excellent gigabit router and N/G wireless router
port[@]##However, the USB shared port does not work as claimed
##Called D-Link technical support 3 times
##The first time I was asked to download the lastest version of the SharePort software, V3
##0 (it came with V2
##0)
##That did not fix the problem
##The second time I called D-Link, I was told to contact the printer manufacturer to get help to configure the printer
##I was told by the printer manfacturer that they weren't responsible for the router USB connection and suggested I call D-Link back (surprise!)
##On the third call to D-Link, I asked to speak with a supervisor who was somewhat helpful
##He asked further, detailed questions leading us to reflash the firmware which also did not fix the problem
##I am now in the RMA stage with D-Link and am to send them the unit at my expense while they send me another router
##My system will be down in the mean time and they would like a credit card number - I'm not pleased about this! I may just return the product and get a refund unless someone knows how to fix this
##I bought this router because of its high ratings
##This is a good router, both wired and wireless but the feature that attracted me to this (the shared USB port) does not work as claimed
##If this gets fixed, I will update my review
[t] D-Link did it again! Perfect problem solver!
##It came time to upgrade my home network from 802
##11g to 802
##11n, and retire my DI-524 that served flawlessly 24/7 for 5+ years
##I also retired my desktop PC since it became nothing more than a print server and music/picture storage with both my wife and I running laptops and the TV connected with a media center
##However, we have a perfect Dell 1100 USB-only laser printer we use regularly
##The idea of a having to get a print server to connect the Dell 1100 wasn't the way I wanted to go, and we'd really like to have some network-available storage
port[@]##So, a router with an intelligent USB port appeared to be ideal
##Having just rebuilt a home network for my best friend with a Netgear WNDR3700 (all that could be purchased off-the-shelf in San Rafael, California), I WAS Not impressed with the ReadyShare USB on it
##In fact, there is still constant problem transferring large media files back and forth to the 1TB external USB drive, but the size of the network and need for dual-band in that household trumps the issue
##I will say that Netgear does have a vey simple, intuitive setup screen for its router in comparison
installation[@]##Moreover, I cannot express enough how pleased I am that I went with the much more cost-effective DIR-655! Setup is easy, though I understand first-timers may have difficulty but if you download and read (either from the D-Link website or off the installation CD) the full instructions you'll be fine! I have a brand new RevB DIR-655 that came with the latest 2
##00NA firmware loaded
##I had my 802
##11g WPA-encrypted wireless network down and a new 802
##11n WPA2-encrypted network up and connected to all wireless devices in less than 45 minutes
##I then fired up Shareport expecting a bit of a struggle with the Dell 1100 print - nope, NO PROBLEM! For each laptop, I simply removed the old profile for the printer (was accessed via the former networked desktop), installed the latest Dell driver for the printer, loaded up the Shareport utility, and we were printing!Feeling confident now, I pulled the two 3
##5-inch 500GB EIDE slave drives out of the now-retired desktop, dropped them into a pair of external aluminum enclosures (cost me $21 total for the enclosures), and hung the Dell 1100 and 2 drives off a USB hub connected to the router
##The Shareport utility found everything perfectly (wasn't sure with a hubbed connection), and now we have some monster media storage accessible through the network! Better yet, unlike my experience with the Netgear with external storage, I've been able to transfer ENTIRE FOLDERS of media files in the tens of GB size without failure! Now I see a RAID setup in my future
##I also have the crazy notion to connect a USB card-reader to the hub to see if we can read our microSD, SD, and CF flash media over the network simplifying exchange across our wireless devices
[t] great product
##I love this router it has given us no problems at all except for compatibility
##If you are a mac user I would definitely recommend having a pc on hand next to it for ease of set-up
##the instilation CD is not compatible at all with mac so its a bear trying to manually set-up through the mac
##Once the router is set-up its as easy as one click to use it on the mac
##the USB utility on the back of the router which enables you to use a mass storage device or printer
##etc
##does not work with mac
##it works wonderfully with a PC
##So far we have been using this for about a month and it has not lost reception
##our old linksis would lose reception 2-3 times a week
##hope this helps
[t] DIR-655 Router (dual voltage)
##I figured I would contribute a review since I am always looking at other customer reviews and since this product can be quit an investment
##I have only had the router three weeks and it has been working excellent
##I have it standing up instead of laying flat and even though I have it on all the time, I have not had any heating problems the others have experienced
##The system lights are extremely bright so I would not put this in a bedroom but it makes a nice nightlight
##I gave it 4 stars only because I don't know if am am really utilizing all its functions
##I only really use it so that I can surf the net on my notebooks and to network so that I can backup files, music, and pictures on each computers hard drives
##I mainly purchased this particular router because another reveiwer said that this router has a dual voltage power block which I was very glad to confirm that it does
##Let me first state that this is my first wireless router and my first router experience
##I am working with a windows desktop PC, windows 7 starter netbook, and a windows 7 notebook
##I wired it to my desktop to run the application process and was immediately able to starter surfing on my other wireless book
##Speed seems fine but it is hard for me to judge because my dsl isp is not very fast
##As far as networking, I can see all three computers on my desktop but my books can only see eachother and not the desktop which I will have to work on that later
##I would say that this is a good product and would recommend giving it a try
[t] Returned one then found the solution
##I ordered this because I previously owned an earlier model DIR-655
##I had given that one to a friend and upgraded to an apple airport extreme
##That lasted about 11 months then died
##That put me back in the market for another router
##I use this and all the other routers with 3 Dlink DWL-G820 jumps
##That created a problem when trying to use them with this router with the older DWL-G820's
##The Security for the jumps used TKIP only, not AES
##I also checked and made sure the jumps had the latest firmware
##This router had the capability of using either but when using newer hardware such as my Sony laptop (N), Dell laptop (N), Imac wireless, Ipad, Iphone, HP wireless printer, 5 IP cams and a wireless Samsung DVD player, oh and the direct tv DVR, using the TKIP only this router would stop transmitting everyday and sometimes twice a day
##I called DLink tech non-support with no help
##I also replaced my motorola DSL modem thinking it was possibly a problem since I was using the PPPoE in this router not the modem which was necessary to allow IP Pass-through
##Replacing the modem had no effect, my DIR-655 stopped transmitting regularly again after that
##I even set the channel selection of the router to a fixed channel instead of the auto select with no success
##After replacing both hardware items, updating all to the latest firmware, I knew it had to be a setting problem, just what? Having setup Dlinks before, an Apple extreme, a belkin and also a many linksys routers over the past 10 years I Liked the user interface of the Dlink best so I persisted over the next 3 or 4 days in changing every setting one at a time to find the right combo to make it work correctly
##There is something in this routers firmware that will not accept the use of TKIP only for very long
##Each time the router stopped transmitting I would reboot it and it would limp along for several more hours until something changed, likely a frequency collision from a neighboring router that forced a channel change or something
##The solution I found was to set one network SSID using B/G only, and TKIP only for the DWL-G820's and the other network using all three B/G/ and N plus TKIP and AES for the laptops, DVD player network stream and the IPAD
##Prior to finding the solution the best my laptop would connect and flow data at was about 54 Mbs
##now using the multi SSID (with routing across networks enabled) and the auto TKIP, AES my laptops, Dell and Sony connect at 300 Mbs steady and truly
##I transfered a 450 Mb ISO file and it took just over a minute so the 300 is real
##I post this to help anyone else who orders this and pulls their hair out
security[@]##The critical thing to address in the settings is the security
speed[@][u]##It must be TKIP AND AES to get the 300 Mbs rate N  along with steady transmitting, and the G  devices using TKIP only must be on the guest network, well at least be on opposite networks however you set them up
##meaning whichever network SSID uses B/G only for those devices then the other one can be TKIP and AES to allow fast throughput
##I found the quirk about the TKIP only when I tried to use one SSID network in N only
##That is when the router prompted me saying "You can't use N only with TKIP only" definitely an obscure place to have to find out
speed[@]##Now though I am glad I persisted because I am now getting blazing stable speed and distance on my network
port[@]##I haven't tried the USB port since I have all my external drives shared through windows 7 PC's that run 24-7
##I may be making the wrong assumption about the solution but with my router setup this way using one B/G and TKIP then the other B/G/N and AES it works solidly
##Kudos to Amazon for the fast exchange of routers, too bad Dlink tech support failed as well as the GUI of the router that made it so hard to find a solution to the conflict in settings
[t] For the price, excellent buy
##On seeing that this product has been reduced in price, I figured I would post a review to help others looking for a new router
##I have had this now for over a year (Hardware A4 version, 1
##21NA firmware) and with some small caveats, am very happy I bought it
##No router is perfect, and this one is flawed in some respects, but at less than $70, it's a steal
##First the good
##At my firmware level, I have had absolutely no issues with performance or reliability
##Many router owners have to live with the occasional need for a hard reboot, but this one keeps on going
##Reboots are required for many of the Advanced routing feature settings to be edited, but once you are set up, you stay up
##Initial set up was relatively straightforward even though I did not use the included setup disk
##There are wizards in the web interface for both wired and wireless setup
##I had a few attempts because I was using some bad DNS addresses at first, but this was user error
##I used advanced DNS eventually which works well
##Some users have reported issues with this with some 1
##3xNA firmwares, but it works fine for me on 1
##21NA and is easily disabled if you need to
##Wired performance is good with my setup
##I have a Windows 7 desktop (and was using Windows XP before my upgrade with this also), a Mac OS X 10
##5 MacBook Pro with a Windows Vista VM on it (I often use this on wireless also)
##I have a VOIP telephone using a LinkSys adapter and a PS3 console
##All run with no issues
##Connecting wirelessly, I have a Windows Vista Dell laptop, running on the extremely useful guest access feature
##This allows you to give a different account which can have limited access (i
##e
security[@]##no LAN access) or a different security type if needed
##Very useful for visitors
##Wireless range is great, and even wireless G gives good speeds
##I have tested with wireless N and can connect at 150 MB/s
##It is due to the limitation of the AirPort card of my MacBook Pro that I can't connect at the full 300 MB/s that wireless N supports, so I can't comment on this side of the router's performance
##What I can say is that the N range I have is good and that others on the D-Link forums seem happy with this aspect of the router
##The web UI is good and well organized
price[@]##The feature set is quite extensive for the price
port[@]##You have virtual routing, which allows you to route an incoming port to one of your attached devices for a particular service
port[@]##One example might be to route port 22 to port 22 on your desktop PC and allow ftp to run on that box
internet[@][u]##Used with dynamic DNS (which allows you to use a free service that constantly 'maps' your router's dynamic external address assigned by your ISP to a web URL of your choosing) you can set up an ftp web site for yourself, available anywhere on the  at (for example) [
##]
##Not bad for $65
##I also use this to stream HD content from my desktop to my PS3
##I now use wired and can stream 1080p content without a hiccup, but with wireless G, I was able to do 720p well
##The use of gigabit LAN ports helps here I think, and this is another feature you won't find on similarly priced routers widely
streaming[@]##Gigabit is only useful for devices requiring extra bandwidth, but it certainly helps with media streaming and file shares for example
##Finally, the automated QOS (Quality of Service) is just the best I have seen
##I use lots of bandwidth-hog applications, and no matter how heavy the traffic, I can still browse the web or make a VOIP phone call comfortably
##And this is with default settings
##I could add rules for certain devices, but I have not yet had the need to
##There are one or two caveats
software[@]##Those looking to this as a cheap NAS (Network Attached Storage) or print server solution will be disappointed to learn that this is only designed to give NAS/printer access to one user on the LAN at a time, and each user has to load a software client to use the device at all
##Also, this feature is reported to have problems at the firmware level I run
##I simply do not use it
##I am not tempted to run higher levels of the firmware after reading instability reports on 1
##3xNA firmware
##Common complaints are having to reboot the router daily/weekly/monthly
##Using 1
internet[@]##21NA, I only reboot when I change a setting or my internet goes down
##Please note that this is not a dual band router
##It works on the 2
##4Ghz bandwidth only
##Dual band routers can assign wireless traffic to either band, making your total throughput better
##I have no 'real world' experience of this, but do not use wireless that heavily, so it doesn't overly concern me
##If you have lots of devices using 2
##4 Ghz (wireless phones/mice/keyboards, bluetooth etc
##) this may be a feature you would benefit from
##For anyone out there looking for a 'best bang for the buck' router, I would recommend this one
##However, I would advise caution with firmware updates
##If you want stability guaranteed, remain with 1
##21NA and join the forum to keep an eye on the stability of the latest build
##Note that once you update to 1
##3xNA, any downgrade to 1
##2x or lower is unsupported (though it is possible)
port[@]##Only do this to use the USB port or other advanced features designed to work better on those firmwares
##It seems that 1
##34NA is performing well, so it may well be worth testing out if your device comes installed with 1
##3xNA firmware already
##If you need to upgrade, read the upgrade instructions thoroughly, backup your configuration (via the web GUI), reset the router to default settings, perform the upgrade then restore your configuration from the backup
##This has been seen time and time again to avoid upgrade issues
##In many cases, I recommend screen-capping your settings and changing them manually after the upgrade
##Hope my review helps you make your decision
[t] Firmware upgrade MANDATORY!!!
##Pro's - Trust all the reviews listed, this is a great router
##It is easy to set up (more on that in the con's section)It has AMAZING functions that most won't understand (but make it more secure)It is awesomely fast
##It has a great reception/antennae strength
##Con's - Trust all these, but take them with a grain of salt
##I always read the negative review first and look for the negatives when I get a product, i found that mine didn't work well either like some people claimed
##It worked AMAZINGLY with my XP desktop, but for some reason, would not work for squat with my wife's NEWER Vista Laptop
##My router indicated the most up to date firmware
##When i had trouble setting it up with my wife's computer and called tech support, three days later, they told me i did not have the most up to date version
software[@]##Don't trust the firmware reporting from the router software
##Do an upgrade regardless when you get this before setting up the wireless (wire required)Enjoy the inexpensive speed, security, bells, and whistles!
[t] Excellent!
##*** Ignore any of the negative reviews based on one thing ***- If your read the manual, do some research, and have half an ounce of geek in you, then this router is the BOMB!It is not simple if you don't have some experience
##But, it has all the bells and whistles any home network person could want
##I increased the throughput of my son's xBOX, added 2 laptops, and one desktop
speed[@]##xBOX has priority on the net and all the other systems still have awesome speed
##D-Link customer support is crap, customer service is crap, BUT, this router is awesome
##Never been a D-Link fan until now
##If you want a great wireless router, this is the one!If you don't know how to read and/or don't have the "geek" in ya
##Then get the router and pay a geek to configure it for you
##You will not be dissapointed
[t] P-5354
##metal parts came off when we first unplugged the networking cable
##kind of disappointed w/ that kind of quality
##other than that, its good product
[t] My first D-link, used to be a Linksys customer
##I bought this router to replace a WRT-160N router from linksys that just wasn't working good (by the way I don't recommend by any means linksys, it used to be a good brand, but it is not any more
##This Dir-655 has worked ok, I have no major complains and what is really great is the fact that it has external antenas, so range can be boosted easily
##The only that just doesn't work is the usb share-port, but anyway it's kind of a plus so
[t] opigg
##I purchased the dir655 primarily because it had the n capability
##It not only provides me 300 mbps wireless connectivity (depending on the wireless card in your computer) but it is more powerful than other routers that I have had
##All I can say is that if it quits I will buy another one and I have two of them, in different locations of course
[t] Horrible...Stay Away
##I purchased the DIR 655 when I received the unit it would not accept an IP address from my DSL modem
##I sent it back RMA
##The replacement unit accepted an IP from my DSL modem, but would turn off the WiFi every 5 to 20 minutes
streaming[@]##The router is absolutely useless for streaming DLNA from my home media server
##I don't believe in "3 strikes your out" with consumer products
##Hit me once shame on you, hit me twice shame on me
##I am no longer a faithful Dlink consumer after this experience
##Having to pay shipping fees twice to return the router and paying a 15% restock fee I am out of $30 from my pocket
##Next time I will just set flame to a 20 dollar bill and a 10 dollar bill
##I am back to using my 7 or so year old DGL 4300 that has a failing WiFi radio until I can find a reputable Wireless Router to replace it
[t] IPOD touch and secured network
##I rec'd a DIR 655 router yesterday and was unable to connect with my IPOD using a secured network
security[@]##I called customer service and they eventually told me the IPOD would not work with WEP or WPA security settings
security[@]##It worked with no security enabled
security[@]##After some pondering, I changed the security settings to WPA Personal on the dlink router page
[t] unreliable
##This router requires frequent rebooting, sometimes several times a day
##Increasingly buggy and temperamental after a year
##Just ordered a Cisco linksys E3000
##Update
[t] D-LInk DIR-655
##Great product
##Easy to install
##Have had no problems
##A lot better than my old Belkin router
[t] Disappointed with this latest revision
##I have owned a Dir-655 (version A2, firmware 1
##34NA) for almost 3 years, and for about the last 3-4 months, the router started acting up and needed a reboot once a week or so
##Since I have been fairly happy with it, I decided to get the same one again (version B1, firmware 2
##0)
##I am pretty proficient in setting up networks
security[@]##My current configuration includes several computers, iPhones, iPods, Wii, PS3, printers, security cameras, home server, VOIP adapters etc
##My current DIR-655 handled them all ok in the past with no issues until recently (with reboots)If you need a basic setup, and do not need to use any of the advanced features, then this might work for you; unfortunately, the advanced features did not work on this latest revision; it was an absolute nightmare
##It took me over 6 hours to try and make this thing work right, to no avail
##I might have gotten a lemon but surely did not feel like taking the chance in getting another one and having to go through this again
##For my techy friends, here are a few issues I've experienced
[t] Works Great!
##I bought this for my father and installed it in him home
##The router is on one side of the house and he has great reception for his iPad throughout the house
##Very easy set-up and install
[t] 3 months later and NO issues
##After a call to my ISP (to get passwords) and then another to DLink (my router and modem had the same IP address)I am up and running
##The router is performing very well compared to the Linksys WRT160N that I bought 30 days prior(and now regret)
##The Linksys was a bit easier to set up and I had no problems with the signal or down time
speed[@]##However, the Linksys speed was terrible! With the DLink, the speed on my laptop is faster than the land line PC I have (granted the PC is much older than the Laptop)
##Pages fly up and videos never skip a bit via the wireless connection
##Update 3 months later - Still no issues
##To add info based on other reviews
[t] Great Router, but change the channel width to 20/40 MHz
##I love the router but was frustrated that I was only connecting at 56Mbps
##Once I configured the router and NIC settings to use Auto 20/40 MHz, I now connect at 135-150 Mbps, so remember to change this setting
##Gigabit backbone is awesome too
##Haven't used the SharePort yet
##The router has tons of configuration options, which can be a bit much for the everyday user, but makes it very configurable for those that want/need it
##No heat problems what so ever
##Enjoy
[t] Fast, cool but no real range increase over my Netgear 54
security[@]##My router sets up as 24mbs with WPA2-AES security enabled
##I do not have any N devices, and in fact only use the wi-fi for my PS3 and iPhones, in addition to the occasional visitor (my dad) who brings a laptop
##I am located in the basement of a two story house (so that's kind of three stories) and the Netgear 54 would reach the whole house, although it would have nooks and crannies where it dropped to one bar on the iPhone
##There appears to be no improvement in range whatsoever with the new router
speed[@]##However, due to the speed increase it appears to be faster even in these one-bar zones of the house
##I even tried making a mount about 7 feet up from the floor on the wall of the basement (9 foot ceilings down here, so that still leaves a couple feet headroom) to get the router closer to the main floor and away from speakers and printers and monitors down here on the desk
##Didn't really see an improvement in range after that either
##I do not have an overheating problem as one popular review notes, in fact it isn't even very warm to the touch
##The blue leds are BRIGHT
##Not sure why manufacturers don't offer red or dimmer led options
##Doesn't matter to me, in fact I like it as it works as a "night light" in the basement once the monitor cycles down in global warming mode
##Setup was FAIRLY easy, but it bailed at one point and had me restart the computer and restart the setup process
##But it seemed to recognize where we had left off and installed easily from there
##It did not manage to log into my Netgear router to get settings, although it tried and failed
##Didn't matter as I was planning on changing settings from that setup anyway
##This model is starting to get harder to find, most stores do not seem to have it in stock and you have to order online
##But it can still be found online fairly easily at the time of this writing and is a good solid, fast router
##Had I known that I wasn't going to get any significant range improvement, I'm not sure I would have spend the $ though
##My old router worked fine, I was hoping this would improve range significantly and it didn't
[t] Get one!
##This is awesome and easy to set up
##I am not a computer genius and still no problems
##I am sure that you will find it worth while and now am even using wireless printing and networking with this thing
##Seriously, you won't be disappointed!
[t] whole house wireless
##This is the best router I have ever had
##I was able to go wireless down stairs some 30ft away
[t] Excellent product
##Works great
##Improvement over my netgear with only 1 antenna
##It doesn't need to be reset during heavy downloads
[t] fast
##I bought this router because it had wireless n technology
##That technology is quick and it is
internet[@]##I set the router up without using the disc and you can do that, just type in your gateway address in an internet browser and set it up from there
##I got it all set up and at first (using a wireless n adapter for my laptop) i only got 130-150Mbps and thats because the router was set up to only use 20MHz
##I needed to use channel bonding to get that 270-300Mbps so i logged in to my router and picked wireless settings and chose manual set up and i changed 20MHz to 20/40MHz auto
##Its automatic so when another wireless n nearby turns on the router will switch back to 20MHz(130-150Mbps) to prevent interference and thats because this router is only using 2
speed[@]##4GHz, if you want full speed without worrying about interference you need to get a 5
##0GHz router, not this
##Luckily, my neighborhood doesn't use wireless n and there's only one other router in my neighborhood, so i always get 270-300Mbps
##I read other reviews and some of them complains about heat problems
##I don't care about that because my old router that i had for 4 years heats up, too and i think this router runs cooler
security[@]##For security there's WEP or allow or block mac addresses
##i chose the mac address option, and i just simply type in the mac addresses of the computers or videogame consoles that i'm going to allow to use this router
[t] Perfect Wireless N Router
##I bought this item to replace my broken Linksys WRT160N
##This product works much better than the Linksys that I have replaced
##It has a very good range
##I use it in a three story town house and I'm able to receive a stable N connection all over the house even in basement
##This was not possible with my Linksys
speed[@]##Also, the speed and reliability is far more superior than the counterpart Linksys
##Overall I'm very happy with this product
##=====================================================Update
[t] D-Link DIR-655 router review
##Product arrived quickly
##Easy setup without any problems
##Strong signal throughout our single family home
[t] GOOD RANGE, GREAT PRICE
##The main negative aspect that I had read about this router was that it became very hot
##I have not experienced this at all
##I find that the connection is great and the range is pretty good
price[@]##The price through amazon
##com was very nice as well
##I am definitely satisfied with this product
[t] Very happy with this router
##This is my first router purchase so I had expectations of problems with installing and operating
speed[@],installation[@][u]##The  was very easy and the wireless speed is not noticeably different from the wired
##It is very fast and seems to have good range
##My laptop gets excellent connectivity in the basement, the garage, and outside on the patio
##I highly recommend this router
##I have not noticed the heating issue that was mentioned by JMK but agree that the blue lights are pretty bright
[t] needed help
##This router was recommended by our computer "help" guy
##I found and excellent price, and received it in 3 days
security[@],software[@][u]##Our "help" guy had to assist in the set up, putting a security link on it and removing the "magic" 
[t] False advertisment!!! the signal is weak!!!
##This unit does not do what it says
##It does not give you stronger signal than any other unit!!! The configuration process is very easy and user friendly
##The signal is weak
##For once I would have liked amazon to make an error in my order, they never do!!, this product does not work!!
[t] Long setup but worth the rewards
##I'm a computer tech and this puppy took me two hours to set up (customized)
installation[@]##First, the installation disc "baby" walks you through a regular set up
##I wanted to forget the disc and install directly to the default IP web page
##Well, the settings didn't hold twice
##I started over and finally got it done
##Replaced a D-Link MIMO router that died
speed[@]##You'll need to get a Wireless N card to get the speed
##I'm at 54Gbps and it is smooth with good range (through the floor to the room above router
##) All in all a good router once you get through the set up
[t] No Better and No Worse
##After installing this router I found it no better and no worse than the D-Link Router I picked up on sale for $20
speed[@]##The range was about the same and I did not see any noticeable increase in the speed
[t] Best wireless router
internet[@]##We have 4 computers and a nintendo DS that all needed internet
##one being a laptop so we had alot of problems that netgear couldn't help us with
##So we sent back netgear and DLink reccommended the DIR 655
##We are soooo happy now!
[t] SLOWEST ROUTER EVER!!!
##After reading all the good review I was convienced that it is worth $69
##99
##The description says "14X faster speed"Hell NO!!! This roughter is slow
##I dont recommend this model
##I had Dlink rougter in the past and I've paid much less than this and that roughter was fast
##This one is slow for me
##I dont really care how much I paid for, but what really pissed me off the most about DLINK product is their tech support
##They are the most unprofessionl, unhelpull, and the most stupid tech support ever
##I believe most of them are located in the Philippines
##I've called them three times before I've got my wireless roughter set up and I had to yell, and treaten to get the last tech support I spoked with, fired!
##I felt at that time it was the only way I can get them to help me out
##I had to go to that drastic measure to get the help that I needed and that is not good
##So, one star for DLINK roughter and zero for their tech support
##Thank you
[t] Not that good
##I got a refurbished version of this and the generic password that comes with it doesn't work because someone has already used it
##Therefore, you must call tech support for them to reset the router and install it in a different way online
##I already had another router so getting online wasn't a problem but kind of a hassle
##It took about 45 minutes to complete
##I got this because I wanted to get wifi 2 floors down and on the other side of the house, it was worth a try
##It didn't do the job in my situation
##My wifi is only slightly better, but like I said I am in the basement and the router is on the 2nd floor and on opposing sides
##I guess for my location the fact that my wifi is slightly better is a good thing
[t] Total piece of garbage
##This router might work for some, but BEWARE if you have Vista or even some versions of XP this thing WILL NOT work without extensive configurations and time, I spent 2 hours with customer service trying to get mine to work and after they cut me off twice, I was trying to talk to someone from india who could not speak English and was in a room with 100 people, when I asked to be transfered to someone else, she put me on hold for 20 more minutes and I git a male indian who I could not understand and after 30 minutes of struggling with his English I gave up
##I am sending this thing back, it will not recognize Vista, and it does not recognise another computer I have which has XP
##I did the steps correct becuase it DID recognize two comp I have with new versions of XP
##The biggest problem is their customer service
##I was on hold for over 90 minutes and never got my problem solved
##I sent emails as well and got nothing
##If you are an IT expert then you might be OK but if you are a IT savvy lay person who wants a home router THIS IS NOT THE COMPANY TO BUY FROM, they are a tech head supply firm for people who know the lingo and can do advanced configurations
[t] Awful router - don't waste your time and money...
##I had this router for a few months and it gave me problems right from the start
##I thought at first it might be my computers, but soon realized that it was the dlink router
##Upon further investigation I found out that dlink uses cheap parts in their routers and they often burn out
##I'm now using a an AirPort Extreme Base Station from Apple and I couldn't be happier
##I wish you the best of luck if you decide to go with any dlink routers
[t] Don't buy this if you are running Vista.
##I was excited to get a better router to replace an older, weaker one and found this one to be among the highest ratings on c-net so I bought it
##12 hours later, 6 with d-link's tech support, which hung up on me twice and 6 wrestling with it myself I gave up
internet[@]##The computer connects to the internet fine with just the cable modem, but add this in the mix and although the computer can communicate with the router, it can no longer connect to the internet
internet[@]##The tech insisted it was my computer even though it works fine with the internet as long as the router isn't attached
##I suspect it is a Vista/Internet 7 problem even though this router insists it is supposed to work well with Vista
##In short, if you have a computer running Vista, don't buy this, and if you have a problem with d-link, just return the product; their tech support requires you to wait for an hour and a half even though they said it was about a twenty minute wait and when you finally get somebody, they do the simplest fixes possible and then blame it on something else
[t] Works great
##Product has been working fine for a month, so I have no complaints about it
##Friend set up, so can't comment on ease of set up
[t] Great but not perfect
price[@]##I'd say this is one of the better router of its price range
##D-Link's firmware is always a pain to work with though
##I've jumped from a cheap linksys WRT54G2 to this DIR655
##singal is amazing, range is impressive and the connection doesn't drop
##Cons
[t] i recommend it
##I've had many top notch routers thats way more expensive than this one
##This router definitely gives competition to more expensive routers
[t] Great
##Reasonably priced, arrived on time and in one piece
##Sturdily built and works as advertised
##Easy Set-Up
##I have had no problems with this device
[t] Exelente
##Soy de Paraguay, y me llego en perfecta condiciones, y es un exelente aparato , muchas gracias creo que lo volveria a comprar si es necesario
[t] Good wifi range.
##I got this to replace and older 802
##11g and I'd estimate that my wifi range nearly doubled
##Really love it!
[t] 1 Year after purchasing and it's already on the fritz
##It was a great router while it lasted but almost exactly a year after purchasing, I need to keep rebooting the router because the antenna will stop working
[t] my standard for wireless
##d-link or cisco
##only 2 i'd use
##this is my 2nd d-link install for seperate buildingeasy setup, good instructions; good tech support;firmware still being upgraded as of 2012!!
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Simply Great
##More RF power to all my devices through out the house
##I have been using this unit for a month or so and would recommend this router to friends and family
##My son has one and likes it so that is why I bought this model
##I had a D-Link DIR 601 which could not handle all my devices
##The support people were just great in helping me set it up after I messed it up during set up
[t] Works
##You aren't going to game better just because of a router, unless you are having problems with your existing connection
##I did have problems and now I don't
##I did have to change a bunch of stuff in the dir 655 to optimize it for the xbox
##It wasn't hard though
##If you get the dir you have to get your ISP to put your existing modem in bridge mode
##Then give yr xbox a static ip, Put that ip in the DMZ, Turn on Multicasting
##Port fwd the ports you need for what ever game you are playing
##See easy!
[t] Best Wireless Router I Have Ever Owned...By FAR
##Im sitting on this thing right now
##Man oh man
##im getting a "very good" signal where my connection used to be dropping
##I used to have a few problems with WiFi
##The first problem was obviously the range
##as I said a few moments ago, the DIR-655 fixed that
##I mean, even though it claims 6x range, but I was going to be happy with just a 25% improvement
##I seriously think that this router increased my range 50-75%!I used to always be frustrated with the lack of settings in many routers
##Some would have QoS (Quality of Service
internet[@]##something that can prioritize important internet activity like Voice Over IP
internet[@]##internet phone) but it didnt really work
##Some would be lacking in semi-advanced routing features
##others would barely have any non-novice features at all
##This one has plenty of options for the advanced user to have a lot of fun screwing with settings
security[@]##The most beautiful thing about it though, is that there is a wizard in the interface so that even the most novice of users can set up a great network with strong security
##It also has context sensitive online help
##what that is, is when you are trying to adjust settings and you dont know what something means, there is a little help button right there that you can click to get an explanation right then and there! Its kinda like the Yin-Yang of routers
##I want to mention that I have been looking at draft-N routers for a few weeks now and have been reading the reviews
##The reason that I am writing this review is that it was so hard for me to find a good review on this router
##Cnet doesnt even have an official review (as of 2/13/07) but it does have very positive user comments
##From my homework though, (user reviews, and more importantly official reviews from Cnet, engadget, etc) every Draft-N wireless router has some kind of problem
##Some dont work well in environments with more than a couple neighboring networks, some dont have good throughput, and some dont have better range
##Again, I didn't want to buy this one because I couldn't find any solid review on it
##After going through a couple of different Draft-N routers, Let me help you out
##This is the one
##BTW
##im not running an "N" wireless adapter
##this thing even increases the range of "B" and "G" signals
##GREAT JOB D-LINK!
[t] Hotter than the sidewalk in Phoenix in July
##First off, the really tough thing about wireless routers is that your performance can vary dramatically from someone elses
##Whether its your hardware, your software, spyware, configuration of your house, your ISP, what type of cordless phone you use, or a myriad of other things, your experience may be entirely different from your best friend's
##So, this isn't so much a review of the router as it is a review of my experience with it
##The GoodThis router has all of the bells and whistles with the exception of dual band broadcasting
##QoS, WISH, VPN, Port Forwarding, all levels of security, etc
##It has Gigabit wired ports
price[@][u]##You cannot get anything more elsewhere without doubling the 
##It is all packaged within an attractive set up that provides hope that this will be your last router for quite some time
##Set up is easy and straight forward
##And, most importantly, you literally cannot get a faster router when within 30 feet
##The BadI really wanted to keep this router but I couldn't
##My main problem was heat
##After a few hours of use (just being on at all), this router was almost too hot to touch
##I actually exchanged it figuring it must be a bad router but the new one was the same way
internet[@]##And, more importantly, when it got hot, I got intermittent lag via my wire machine on my internet traffic
##Games that played flawlessly on my old Buffalo router started lagging; video started stuttering; downloads started pausing
##Diagnosed it with my ISP as being on my side of their modem
##When my old router was plugged in, all problems went away
##D-Link tried to help me but there was a language barrier and no matter what we did with QoS and WISH, it didn't go away
##I had to return the router
##The UglyFYI
[t] Fast Enough for HD-DVD Playback
##Very satisfied
##Smaller than expected
##Fast enough to play HD-DVDs wirelessly to my notebook (Dell Inspiron E1505, 802
##11BGN, 945GM, Core Duo (2) 2GHz, Vista Premium, Arcsoft Digital Theater, D-Link DNS-323 NAS)
speed[@]##Great speed and coverage
##Also handles HDTV perfectly via HDHomeRun device
##Don't forget to upgrade firmware
##Update 11-Nov-2007
[t] Our Product, Your Problem
##Here's my experience with D-Link and this router
[t] FAAAAAST!!!
##Wow! I used a Linksys RT31P2 for the last year or so
##It was a piece of junk!! Would slow down, get constipated, and finally died
##Since we are Mac family (I have been an IT consultant too long to stay PC) I used the Airport Extreme (802
##11g) for a while also
##It was reliable
##BUT WHEN I PLUGGED IN THIS D-LINK ROUTER, I realized that all my previous routers had been huge bottlenecks
speed[@]##Over the Airport, my upload speed on Comcast cable modem increased from 4Mbps to 20Mbps
##Wow
##Didn't even realize Comcast had opened up that much bandwidth
##[
##]So in my house we have a wired Mac, wireless Mac, wireless TiVo, Vonage adapter, Airport printserver, Airport iTunes, and they all work fine
##I am currently using 802
##11g and WPA2 since I don't own any 802
##11n stuff yet
##Signal strength for 802
##11g has doubled on the fringe areas from 30% on my Tivo adapter to 60%
##I bought the D-Link vonage ATA adapter and plugged into one of the ports
##I was concerned my phone calls would get choppy since the ATA is behind the router
##HOWEVER, THE D-LINK ROUTER HAS SOME VERY GOOD QoS FEATURES AND USING THE AUTOMATIC SETTINGS, THE VONAGE CALLS ARE NOT CHOPPY AND EVERYTHING WORKS FINE
##Build Quality
[t] Great device
##I previously had a Linksys WRT54G and was moderately satisfied with it until it started exhibiting signs of 'cheapness', like general flakiness, inability to load the web management (it'd load a blank screen), etc
##After getting frustrated enough, and desiring a router with gigabit ports, I started searching, until I came across the DIR-655
##The first best part (and there's more than one) of this router was unpacking it
##Honestly, it's the sexiest networking device I've seen in a long while
##There's a button hiding stealthily on the right side, if you take note, but no mention is made of it in the manual
##Also included in the package is a little black plastic stand, so you can stand the router on end - that's pretty standard for D-Link, and I like that
##They threw in a Cat-5 cable, was that a joke? What am I going to do with a Cat-5 cable on a gigabit router? That's very amusing
software[@]##I elected not to run the software included on the CD
##There's no real need if you know what you're doing
internet[@]##However, for more advanced users I'd recommend connecting the router to your computer, but NOT connecting to your internet connection (cable modem), and just spending a few minutes familiarizing yourself with your new sweet toy and all of her options
##Now for the good stuff
[t] This little cutie COOKS
speed[@]##It was high time to get network speeds up to Gigabit levels, and the need for speed fed my willingness to risk going with draft-level, pre-standard 802
##11n tech
##With two desktops and two laptops on a home-biz and home network, routing was critical
##Age and traffic-level burned out my last, wired router from the L-word company
##Two teenage daughters tortured the replacement wireless WRT-350NLinksys WRT350N Wireless-N Gigabit Router with Storage Linkto death with incessant instant-messaging
##To keep that router UP required thrice-daily re-starts
##Tweaks inspired by the manual, FAQs and Forum did not definitively fix it
##When two generations of firmware upgrades did not help, it became evident I needed another, real solution
##TA-DA! In walks the D-Link DIR-655D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##BAM! It sets up in a trice, works right out of the box
##It's working! Log-in to the router web interface and dig in for a few minutes
##Create a secure password
##Want security? ZOOM! Use the wizard to set-up respected WPA2
##Clone a MAC Address? Push a radio-button
##Apple user? No problem, since all of the setup wizards are resident on the router, and use the same web interface, it works the same across platforms
##I was tempted by the Apple AirPort Extreme Base StationApple AirPort Extreme Base Station (Gigabit) MB053LL/A, in fact, I run an older version with NO PROBLEMS
##But the D-Link DIR-655 had four 10/100/1000 (Gigabit) W/LAN ports and cost less besides
##It's performance ranked first among six n-draft routers, did great in mixed (b, g and n) environments and only fell to the middle of the pack over long ranges (according to reviews at C-NET and elsewhere)
##Users gave it high marks for satisfaction
##(Users gave my L-word router the finger)
antennas[@][u]##So, this li'l white router the size of a paperback book, with its three  and blinking baby blues is so reliable and cute, I could just kiss it
##And, kiss that L-word router good-bye
[t] The Best Performing Router I've Owned
##Extremely impressed with this router's speed, range, and ease of use
software[@][u]##My only complaint (like others) is with the  bundled with this item
software[@][u]##It's already out of date, right out of the package, and upon installation, it will prompt you to "update to the new version, free", and that's fine, but what happens is the new version of the  is not compatible with the firmware preinstalled on the router
##This fatal combination prevents the router from functioning
##You will have to download a firmware update from the Manufacturer to get the unit working again
software[@]##Not a difficult task, however technical support at D-link doesn't seem to know anything about the software that comes with their product, so I ended up speaking to the technical support team at the software company, who immediately knew what was wrong
##Kind of a letdown for this scenario to occur right out of the box
##Fortunately, it was easy to do, and the router returned to life, immediately
[t] Connection slow, troubleshooting and tech support poor
##I bought this router in part because I had read in a few places that it worked well with the new laptop I had purchased, but also because of the many glowing reviews on places like Amazon
internet[@],speed[@]##Installation was a breeze, but unfortunately my internet connection speed dropped by about 80% after installation, on both my desktop PC (wired to the router) and my new notebook
internet[@]##The internet connection was usable but noticeably slower
##I tried EVERYTHING, including shutting off wireless capability in case of interference and adjusting every setting imaginable in the router online configuration, to no avail
##And yet, as soon as I disconnected the router and connected my desktop PC back to my cable modem, the speeds were back to normal
##D-Link tech support was of little help; they would suggest a minor tweak in the online configuration, tell me to reboot the router, then call them back if the problem persisted
##We repeated that cycle a few times with no progress
##I spent hours tweaking settings, troubleshooting, and researching online
##Nothing
##So now I have to figure out whether the particular router I was sent just happens to be defective and can be replaced, or if this brand of router doesn't "play nice" and I need to find a different one entirely
##I'm no tech dummy but this has been a real chore and support from D-Link has been disappointing
##I will update my rating at a later time if my experience with this product improves
[t] My extensive test with Comcast and with 802.11G Dell Notebooks
##I upgraded from my dLink DI-624 to the DIR-655 because my DI-624 was rebooting every few hours and my dell laptop inspiron 6000(XP) would disconnect every hour
##I have also the dell E1405 (Vista) which would get 2-7% connections on my 3rd floor
##Here is my layout
[t] Dropping connections all day
##I spent two days trying to get router working properly, but it constantly drops wireless connections
##Quite annoying
[t] Buy it if you don't mind dropping connections more than 10 times a day
##I decided to buy a new router when my previous linksys WRT54G2 router didn't resolve DNS properly after 1 years' use, I finally chose this one because of its 4-star ranking
##However, after using it for a week, I can't bear it any more because it drops connections more than 10 times a day
##I am a game player and I can't afford losing the game simply because my router drops connection
##Now I have no other choice but requesting a return
##I hope I could get a full refund
[t] d link router
##Easy set up
##Runs very fast and has not dropped a connection since I set it up
##Well worth the money paid for it
[t] Changing network name fixes problems
##I used the configuration CD to set up a router/admin password
##I kept the SSID name as dlink
##I also kept the random WAP password it assigned
##When I tried to wirelessly connect a laptop, it showed the WAP was not secure
##I called tech support, who had me shut that laptop down
##On the PC connected by cable to the router, she had me enter 192
##168
##0
##1 in the IE address bar for the PC hardwired to the router
##Once the page comes up, the password for the router/admin set up is entered
##Click on Setup/wireless settings/Manual Wireless Network Setup
##On the network name, she had me change it to a name that unique to me but did not broadcast that it was my router
##She then had me change the preshared-key (WAP key) to something else
##Then save changes
##Then, booted a wireless laptop
##It found the newly named secure network and was able to connect
##I connected 5 more wireless computers and a Wii
##There is something about changing the NETWORK NAME that makes it work
[t] Plug and Play
##My old D-link 2xx router's power cord went out and I decided to upgrade
internet[@]##I use the internet for phone (MagicJack), TV (Boxee, Netflix/Roku), and wireless laptop
##I ditched cable TV and phone over a year ago and have not looked back
speed[@]##This router has a marked increase in wired speed to my desktop, improved VOIP phone quality, and ROKU is able to stream in HD even during peak hours
##I plugged in the router and it immediately started working
security[@]##I then used the the included install wizard to set up the security settings
##I did have to restart in secure mode because Mcafee thought the install wizard was a trojan
##I found out that I could not disable Mcafee in its latest form
##I am very pleased with the router
[t] EXTREME WORK HORSE OF A ROUTER!!!
##I've tried out quite a few different routers and I must say, this one destroys just about every single other home router I've ever had
##The only one that was close was the Linksys 54G
##I was looking for a good router, but came out with an absolutely awesome "WORK HORSE" of a router
##This thing has yet to disappoint me
##Granted I've only had it for about a week, but others have let me down even before the week in which I bought them was over
port[@][u]##I use the  forwarding options to  my VNC connections, privoxy proxy, etc
##to and from my home computers (EVEN WAKE ON WAN WORKS - You just have to change the WOL IP Address to x
##x
##x
##255)
port[@]##So far, the only issue (not really an issue) is that when changing certain settings (mainly port forwarding), the settings don't take IMMEDIATELY
##It may take a few minutes, but after it takes effect, I haven't had ONE problem
[t] Get this even if you don't have an N notebook
##I replaced my old USR G router with this Dlink router and finally got perfect connectivity for my 3 wireless G devices; and one connected device
##HP notebook
[t] Excellent product.
speed[@]##I'm using this DIR-655 for about a month now; very satisfied with its excellent speed and performance
##I switched from my over 5 years old D-Link router to this new one
speed[@]##Even with the old one, I didn't have any issues in terms of reliability and operation; but as the technology improved so much over years, I wanted to upgrade to a latest version with higher speed and range
speed[@]##My boys are also very happy now, as they see an excellent improvement in HiFi speed on their PS3, iPod touch, lap top, etc
##In addition to my own good experience with D-Link product, thanks for over 1000s good of reviews on this product that helped to take decision to buy this product
##As some reviewers indicated, I do NOT see any over heating; it is only warm as it operates 24x7 non-stop at my home
##Blue LEDs are bit bright in night; but not a bothersome for me
##If it is bothersome, I can always dim it by sticking some semi-transparent film
##During installation, I faced some challenges in setting D-Link account password
##Contacted Customer Service and they responded promptly
##Basically that issue was due to my old D-Link account, for which I completely forgot the password and the new one was also expecting the same D-Link password
##So, I had to fix back my old router and reset the password and then switch to the new router
##Excellent product and I would certainly recommend this item
[t] Excellent Router
##Excellent router, great speed, many advanced settings, I have a few computer certifications including a network cert so I did not use the cd that came with the router opting to set things up manually so I can't comment on that aspect of this router
##I downloaded and installed the latest firmware, and set up my little home network which includes a windows home server, this router works well with windows home server, along with my laptop and my asus oplay media players
##Those with problems with this router should check their firmware version and revue the manualfor the router
[t] Wi-Fi for iPone
##I had just gotten my lPhone 3GS and found out it can use Wi-Fi
##So I did a google search as to who made a good lPhone friendly router and the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router keep showing up
##I went over to Newegg and read there reviews then came here and did the same
##If the reviews are true this must be a great router! So after 8 months I can honestly say the reviews are true
##My hone network is 1 beat of a gaming computer(I built), 1 Gateway gaming laptop, (for the bed room) 1 Acer netbook, 1 Cannon wireless printer and my iPhone
##So with the help of the D-Link DIR-655 everything gets along
[t] Works well to a extent
##This device works OK, it has reception problems in parts of my home
##I would look at another one that gets better reception than this unit
[t] Powersupply is inadequite - DO NOT BUY
##I had a Xycel x550 that I replaced with the D-Link Dir-655
##x550 was a fine router
##Just getting a little old
##Went with the Dir-655
##Worked fine
##17 months later, it died
##Almost threw it away
##Probably like many others as I had no easy way to test the adapter
##You can't just plug one adapter in to something else
##Especially due to the odd sized plug designed by D-Link
##Intentional? You tell me? Tested it with a volt meter
##Dead
##So, I looked on line to buy one and guess what? No one sells a 1
##2mm x 2
##2mm sized (or what ever stupid size it is) power adapter
##They made these small, I can only guess, because it is a possible revenue generator?New ones are ~$15
##And they will too likely die a short death as well
##In fact, I have never had a Power Adapter die before my actual product before
##So now, I will buy a - / + 12v 2
##5amp or 3amp power adapter or brick and splice this stupid sized end on it
##D-Links only recourse is to buy a new power adapter
##Nearly impossible to find one of this end size
##unless you buy their replacement product
##NetGear or Zyxel for me
##Do NOT buy / Avoid
[t] DLink router - a dud
installation[@]##Followed instructions for installation
##Router worked for about 45 minutes, then browser started going very slow (3-4 minutes after each entry), frequently timing out
##Three calls to technical support
##They have a poor telephone system - noisy
##They obviously are in India - strong accents
##Followed instructions to upgrade firmware (shipped in 2012, but had older 2009 version it it?)
##Still no improvement
##I continue to get the run-around, also intimations that the problem was in my computer
##I finally gave up, purchased a NetGear N600
##Worked flawlessly out of the box - no issues for 3 weeks now
##Tried to get DLink to take back my unit - no dice
##They are stonewalling me
##DO NOT BUY DLINK products
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router
[t] The best !
##This router replaced what our service provider had
##We were tired of getting Kicked off the Internet as our router would only let us have so many electronics on the net at 1 time
##Let me tell you this is Awesome you won't be disappointed i got mine off of craigslist
##If you happen to across one of these pick it up
##I have a very happy family because of it
[t] DIR-615 Router
##Just purchased this to replace cheaper DR-601 model
##Well, not satisfied for a couple of reasons
##My only wireless device is a Kindle Fire, which worked o
##k
##with cheaper router but the range was lacking
##20-30 feet away I couldn't watch Netflix on Kindle
##So after researching, this DIR-615 seemed to fill the bill
##Right off the bat after installing, I couldn't login with the Kindle
##Wouldn't accept the password
security[@][u]##Only after re-installing the router under OPEN  would the Kindle connect
##The $30 DR-601 router did not have this issue
##So now, operating with "pants down and curtains wide open", I decided to check the range of this new $70 router
##Well, the signal dropped off at the same spot and to the same level of weak-signal as the $30 router
##So I'm stuck
##I'm not going to return this unit
##But I'm dissatisfied
[t] So far so good!
##So far the router is cool as a cucumber
##Pros
[t] Very good router except for parental control
##I've had this router for at least 3 years and it has worked very well in all aspects except one
##The parental control features do not work at all
##In the router these are called Website Filtering and Access Control
internet[@]##I've search the internet for a solution to no avail
##I've downgraded the firmware several times, I've used different browsers, etc
##So, if you need to limit your kids' access to facebook to certain hours of the day, this is not the router for you
[t] Nearly 5 years and still going strong!
##I've had the original version of the DIR-655 for well over 4 years and have not had an issue with it yet
##As it is getting to be an old unit that may change soon but with this kind of endurance I think I'll buy another one if it is still offered
##Wireless works outstanding though I turn it off when I don't need it
##Wired is fast as grease lightning, or at least something close
##Sad to hear of the folk's having a problem of one kind or another
##Since this is an older version of the one being offered, I don't need to run the firmware updates as they don't pertain
##Recommend
[t] Aweful firmwares from d-link
##It worked for a while
##However the firmware upgrades from d-link made the router less and less favorable -- they're buggy and hard to get everything set up correctly
##The worst -- the latest firmware upgrade bricked my router and the built-in emergency backup system failed to bring the router back to life!
[t] Close but no Cigar
##Purchased for an application that went between two residential buildings (a house and a garage)
##Straight line distance of 118 Feet
##Could only get a signal at about 100 feet so I returned the product
[t] Read the 1 Star reviews! Don't buy. Don't upgrade firmware!
##This router could not have been worse
##It destroys the ability to access many types of content
##My Ethernet BlueRay (LG) player couldn't use Netflix
##My Ethernet TV (VIZIO) couldn't use Netflix or Pandora
##My computer would suddenly lose the ability to reach the web due to some glitch that puts a Securespot login page between me and all content, even though I had turned SecureSpot entirely off
##And last but not least, the router would go stupid every 24 hours or so and need to be manually rebooted to work
##Some of this nightmare was corrected when I called DLINK and they ran me through a dozen or so obscure settings that needed to be altered in strange ways
##I don't mean basic settings
##I've configured many routers
##I mean truly obscure stuff
##Strangest thing of all is that they don't simply post a configuration file on their support site for Netflix customers, or people using a Mac, or for people who experience the problem where the modem drops off line
##I would still have been annoyed, but at least it would put the solution in the customer's hands
##Bottom line is this
[t] DON'T waste your time!!! This unit is Garbage
##D-Link DIR-655Reference my case # CNX 4007 7988 6After researching, I recently purchased the DLINK DIR 655
##I was planning to use the new DIR 655 to replace an old D-Link DI-604
internet[@]##After half a dozen attempts following instructions, the new unit simply would not make an internet connection
##I suspect something to be fundamentally flawed with the new unit as I have installed enough routers in the past
internet[@]##In a grueling tech support session with a tech support staff, which might have been 2 hours or more of trial and error, the new DIR-655 still would not make an internet connection
##The tech rep was very courteous but the bottom line is the unit did not connect
##I was given a case # and asked to call back
##My time is quite valuable and these sort of matters quickly evolve to frustration leaving a bad taste in one's mouth for a company and it's products
##After careful consideration, I purchased a Cisco Linksys Router as I dreaded another two hour tech support call from D-Link with no guarantee that the DIR-655 would work
##I set up the Linksys and it was up and running in about 15-20 minutes, NO tech support required!The purpose of my feedback should be received a being positive in nature
##I think company engineers and employees should be required to take new products home and work out the kinks before putting them out for sale
##Paying a tech support staff hours to attempt to resolve issues must make some of these products negative cash flow rather than profitable

[t] Tip for better signal strength and speed...
speed[@][u]##I read a couple dozen of these reviews, so forgive me if this tip has been mentioned hundreds of reviews ago! I just stumbled upon it and thought it might help some folks who have had difficulty getting good signal strength and  from this router (while others have had great success)
##I installed this router the other day in my home
##I have an older iMac, older MacBook, new iPhone 3Gs, and a new iPod Touch on the new network
speed[@]##The signal strength and speed was very good (obviously much better than before with a 54 Mbps Netgear router)
##So I was happy with that
##But I also have a new Dell laptop with Windows XP Professional for my full-time home office up in the attic (three floors from the router)
##The signal strength up there was now not very good, and the speed, which previously was 54 Mbps, or very close, actually fell below 20 Mbps at times
##I called D-Link support, which was fast and professional (and free)
##They had me make some simple changes to values in two fields within the Advanced Wireless tab of the router setup screen (using router IP address and a web browser on the network)
##This helped, but much less than I had hoped
##They did tell me not to update the firmware, BTW, from what my router shipped with
##After the call ended, I was looking through the tabs in the router setup from my web browser and decided to turn On the Guest Network, which by default is Off
##I did so using the same SSID as my main network, but added a number at the end
##It also has WPA Security, and is on 24 hours a day, and I did not check the box enabling access with the other network
speed[@]##When I closed out of the router set up screen (and the router reboots by itself) the signal strength shot up dramatically and the speed was now at 130 Mbps in the attic
speed[@]##The speed fluctuates between 78 and 130 daily, which is fine by me
##This second network is 2
##4 Ghz (not sure what the main network is)
##Now I use the Mac hardware on the main network, and my Dell laptop for work on the second network
##This fix worked out great for me, hopefully it helps someone else!
[t] Top-notch wireless router! It works... period!
##I purchased the D-Link DIR-655 as my primary wireless DHCP router when my aged Netgear WGR614 started to act funny (will only connect to one wireless device at a time)
##It is an excellent wireless-N router, and an equally impressive gigabit router
##Although there are over 700 reviews for this device already, I decided to add one more just because it is such an impressive device
##My configuration for this system is not your typical setup
##I have the DIR-655 set up as the main router, and I have a Netgear WRT110 hard-wired (RJ-45 Cat5e) to this router (DHCP disabled) to connect with wireless-g devices
##"Why do I have two routers, when the DIR655 is backward compatible with G as well as N?" one might ask
##The reason I have it with this configuration is because I have a mix of N devices and G devices
speed[@]##The G devices drop the DIR655 down to wireless-g speed (54 Mbps) whenever they are wirelessly connected to the DIR655, even with N devices
##So, I have a wireless-G router hooked to the DIR655, the wireless-G computers are connected to the WRT110 and the N devices are connected to the DIR655, and all the devices are working to my preference
##I need and rely on a fast data transfer rate for viewing HD movies through my network, so a severe bottleneck happens when G devices connect to it
##The DIR-655 still serves as the DHCP router
##I bypassed the disk installer and did a manual configuration
##The setup was quite painless, and I had the wireless router working in 10 minutes
security[@]##Afterwards, I searched the available wireless network, found the router SSID, typed in the password for network security (a definite must-do in San Francisco), and I was wirelessly connected! I never had to reset the DIR-655 since I installed it over a year ago, I have never dropped a wireless connection, and the data transfer has been flawless
##The wireless N devices I have are a 17-inch MacBook Pro, a 15-inch MacBook Pro, a Dell XPS via D-Link DWA-140 (where I store my movies), and an IBM Thinkpad T43
speed[@]##All connect well, and I get at least 28 Mbps speed in the fartherst corners of my house, and above 80 Mbps speed anywhere on the same floor as the router
##I gave it a 5-star rating because it worked for me out of the box and without the disk installer
##No glitches, and the device was current with the latest firmware
##The router is on the second level, and I have decent signal (>72 Mbps) in all the rooms on the same floor, and a stronger signal than the previous g-router on the other floors (18-24 Mbps with WRT110, -vs- 0-12 Mbps with WGR614)
##I've had no issues with heating or overheating
##I use the little "feet" so that the router is "standing" upright
##This helps dissipate the heat better than if it was lying flat on a surface
##It works with various OS flavors, including WinXP Pro SP2, Vista Home Premium, Mac OS X, and Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, and OpenSUSE)
##I've using many of its other features (WPA2 encryption, VPN, QOS, content filtering, filter scheduling, and many others)
##It works as a wireless router, it works as a gigabit router, it works
##plain and simple
##It fully deserves my designation of a 5-star rating
[t] One Nice Piece of Wireless Equipment
##I purchased the D-Link DIR-655 router as a Christmas present for myself (yeah, lame, I know, but I had to get one anyways)
##I went a little over the top with this purchase, opting for the more expensive Draft N over the current G format
##In hindsight, it was definitely way over the top
##For typical home users, most likely the maximum you will need is G, so it might be worth saving a few bucks and looking at a Wireless G model first
##But, this model still turned out to be a good buy
##I have it set to N-mode only, so only laptops with Wireless N can receive the wireless signal
##Very seldom do I actually perform a download that maxes out the wireless download speed, but from what I've seen during those instances, it has been performing at the 130 Mbps specified (or darn close)
##My roommate does more downloading than me and has said the wireless performs faster than his land-line ethernet (100 Mbps)
speed[@]##So, given the positive feedback from him and my observations of its timeliness, I would say speed is terrific
##The range on this thing is absolutely amazing
##In the days following its installation, I took my laptop on a tour around our apartment building after setting the router to mixed mode (for all B, G, and N receiving laptops, which has a lower transmission rate overall)
##Six apartments away, I was still receiving a signal that allowed me to check my email and other websites
##I don't know if the faster speeds were maintained, but that signal penetrated through nearly a dozen walls
##In my experience, I've seen Wireless G routers struggle to make it through a few walls, so this was quite impressive
##Installation was a little tricky, but not entirely impossible
##Networking as a whole is generally a little cumbersome for the average person, but a few iterations through the instructions got it up and working
##The router's browser page is quite organized and descriptive
##This unit has a lot of features, most of which I have not used, but the typical home owner would probably not need half of these
##Some reviewers have complained that this unit runs hot
##Unfortunately, I have to say that this is indeed true
##It does not run hot to the point where I fear it will start a fire or burn my hand, but it does get a little warm from time to time
##It is, after all, an electronic device, which are all prone to getting warm
##There are little vents on the sides and top of the unit, so making sure papers don't get stacked on top will reduce any heat-related issues (an oops I've done from time to time)
##I have not noticed any drop in performance because of the unit getting hot, but again I'm not maxing it out continuously
##I will say that it did begin to get warmer when my roommate hooked up and started exchanging a lot of data, but overall there has been no problem
##If you're worried about heat, just do know that all routers, in some state or use, get hot
##Another reviewer commented on the flashing blue lights on the front panel being obnoxious
##Yes, that is true also
##Unfortunately, I keep this in my room at night and I don't have to worry about buying a night light to find the bathroom
##I keep an office chair between my bed and it and have had no problems as a result
##If you're not trying to sleep though, it actually looks quite appeasing in my opinion (similar to blue Christmas lights)
##All in all, while this wireless router is far above the level in which I need, I am pleased with the purchase I have made
##It has been in my possession for over a year and I have had no problems whatsoever
##Some people may find issues for their particular case, but the typical home user or small office user would likely have no problems with this model either, in my opinion
##I would recommend this product
[t] Router of doom...
##Dlink has always had good routers in my opinion
##I updated my Linksys WRT54G router with this media-streaming bad-boy and haven't looked back
internet[@],speed[@]##Easily streams HD movies from my mac to my PS3 while still allowing full speed access to the internet from my other devices
##Great web page for the system interface
port[@][u]##With the newest firmware update, it allows you to use the USB  for a wireless USB hub for a network printer, hard drive, orwhatever else you can think to use wirelessly
port[@]##Windows only on the network USB port though
##Sorry Mac fans
##HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
[t] Lots of features, stable, fast, easy to set up.
##Preface
[t] Great speed and range but at first it killed my laptop
speed[@]##Extreme N Cable Router has fantastic range and speed
##My laptop seems like it's hooked directly to my DSL
##For these reasons, I give it a good recommendation
##BUT BE CAREFUL
##Initially, it repeatedly gave me a blue screen of death in my two year old Dell laptop
##I got tremendous help from cnet
##com and got a cure
##Althouth "backward compatible" in theory, I had to get updated drivers for the built in Intel wireless in my laptop
##If you plug in the router for the first time, and within seven seconds your wireless computer crashes in a blue screen of death, turn off the wireless router, get online with a "hard wire" connection and get updated drivers
##Do not take your laptop to a repair store
##Out of range of the wireless router it will work fine and they will not understand your concern that there is a computer killing death ray at your home
##BUT, once you get the cure, it's great
[t] Very disappointed
##Trying to take a subjective look at many of the reviews already posted, I had the DIR-655 listed on my wish list
##I wanted to effectively create a NAS drive out of the existing external storage drive I have (WD My Book) because a new router with USB connectivity costs less than buying a new NAS drive
##I already own a D-Link wireless G router (DI-624) that is at least 5 years old and have not had problems with it, so I reasoned [incorrectly] that D-Link is capable of producing a strong product
##The DIR-655 was gifted to me and the adventure began
##Within three days of "working with" (which implies mutual effort on mine and the router's parts) this device, my first inclination was to advertise it on Craigs List as a boat anchor so that it might actually serve a useful purpose
##SETUPI understand networking
##I skipped to the instructions that gave me the router's default IP address and login and went to work from there
##New interface, no problem
##I see the link for the network setup I want and click it
##now I have to log into the router again
##I log in and get returned to the page I was just on; click the link again and it works
##I try to click on a link for a sub-page of the settings group and I get kicked out and have to log in a third time
##I log in again and am returned to the main page again
security[@]##Maybe this is one of the many security add-ons I'm running in Firefox; No Script is notorious for being over conservative and blocking pages or frames of web pages
##I restart the process with Internet Explorer, only to relive the exact same experience
##Through repeated attempts, I am inconsistently able to reach some of the settings pages where I try to make changes - nothing saves
##ever
##SETUP DISCI try the setup disc and it does manage to communicate with the router and setup some basic settings, so that I at least have a password on my network
##I still don't know why this matters, but it seemed to like talking to the CD better than me - so be it
##Now, I have the ability to navigate to pages more consistently, but still with the occasional "kick-back" to the login screen
internet[@]##The ability to save changes is now available, and I seem to have the basic essentials to get my PC's connected to the internet and each other
##LULLED INTO SATISFACTIONSome time later, without making any changes to the router, or any connected device, my PC's have noticeably slow connectivity speeds - both wireless and wired
##Maybe the QoS was giving priority to a neighbor kid who hacked in to look at porn on the net? Maybe the router became self-aware and demanded servitude from humans - I don't know
##Shortly thereafter, the wireless connectivity was intermittent, so I went to a wired PC to check it out
##Even the wired PC was having problems, and the kick-back to login problems were worse than ever
software[@]##USB PORTFor the short time this router seemed to work, my external hard drive worked great with the Shareport software utility
##You can access the drive on one PC at a time, so it's not a true NAS configuration in case this helps anyone
##FRONT LED'SThese are worth noting because you don't want these in an area (like a bedroom) that you want to have darkness
##unless maybe you're using them to spot deer
##I just can't in good conscience recommend this device to anyone who doesn't have disposable income, and isn't willing to take a chance
##Mine is boxed up with the return paperwork and waiting on the mail carrier
[t] The BEST Wireless Router with B/G/N and QOS
##Hello All
##Happy New Year
##A bit of background
##I am coming from 2 Apple Airport Extreme base stations which I could not tolerate after regular drops and continuous issues
##I had regular disconnects
##wired and wireless
speed[@]##and speed issues with bridging the second router
##I therefore decided to go out on the hunt for another router that gave me the options I wanted and wireless N
##I have an IT background
##so options are a must
[t] Not bad at all, but need new firmware to fix bugs
##I have been using this router for 3 months, I don't want to repeat all the "Goods" here again as so many other user reviews already mentioned
internet[@][u]##The only "Bads" I got for this product was the lost of  connection suddenly a few times a week, so I had to reset the router once awhile, I updated to the latest version of firmware, but no help at all, I was so frustrated, and decided to return it
##But after I read the user forum online for this product, found there is a unpublished new firmware 1
##22 beta from D-Link ftp download site, it is a new firmware but not officially published, I downloaded it and loaded it, now it's been one week, the connection hasn't been dropped even once, it seems D-Link has the fix on this beta version, so now I am happy, and decided to keep it
##If you are looking for a good N router this one is the perfect, but remember to update the new firmware if you do have connection drop issue
[t] D-Link lives up to its reputation
##Before I purchased the D-Link wireless router I was using one from NetGear
##The NetGear router just didn't seem to have enough oomph! to get the job done, so I began online research to determine which replacement router I should consider purchasing
##Universally, the D-Link seemed to be the most recommended
##While it's far from perfect, it does a really fine job of keeping my home network up and running
##The network still goes down occasionally, but nine times out of ten the problem seems to stem from my ISP rather than from the D-Link Router
software[@]##The Network Magic software that is offered as a free 30-day trial with D-Link is the "icing on the cake," too
software[@]##This software is easy to use, quite intuitive and can get the network back up and running in short order
software[@]##I did read several reviews that pointed out that Network Magic doesn't do anything to restart a network that one couldn't do oneself, but the question I had is, why would anyone want to do all that "fiddling" if you could get software to do it for you?I am VERY SATISFIED with both D-Link and Network Magic
##Michael Garee
[t] USB Shareport not compatible with Mac OS 10
##The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router works fine as a 802
##11n wireless router
##However, the reason I bought it was to wirelessly share my printer between two Macs using the USB Shareport on the router
##Shareport is not compatible with Mac OS
##After hours of searching the internet, I was disappointed to find that D-Link does not provide support for Mac OS 10
##I bought this in combination with a D-Link DWA-140 Wireless USB Adapter
##D-Link does not provide Mac support for the adapter, however I was able to find a free third-party driver that is compatible
##The best solution for sharing a printer is to use an Apple Airport Express or Apple Airport Extreme
##I returned both D-Link products and purchased an Airport Express
##It was running in a couple minutes, and very easy to wirelessly share my printer
[t] What a difference
##I had an old D-Link - probably 3-4 years old - and could not get connectivity even across the room
##With the new D-Link DIR-655 I can go out to my garden and work on my laptop
##it may even work farther but I haven't tried it yet
##Love it
[t] THIS is the router to purchase!
##I am one to scrutinize purchases to the extreme for value and most of all performance
##After owning a total of five wireless routers in the last ten years, I have to say this is by far the BEST
##Specifically, in the four weeks I've owned it, the system has not dropped a connection even ONE TIME with either my wife's or my laptop, working with both Vista and XP operating systems
##In addition, the range throughout our home is outstanding! I have owned three LINKSYS and a couple other "no name" routers
##Linksys, hailed to be the very best SUCKS THE WORST across the board
##Constant drops in connections were extremely frustrating
##Also, just three weeks out of warranty, expect absolutely nothing but headaches and the run-around from LINKSYS's customer service department
##I can't speak to the customer service with D-Link since I have not experienced any problems whatsoever either with set up or operation of the DIR 655
##If you want seamless performance, under all conditions, with the best possible range, purchase the D LINK DIR 655, and have "N" and the other end
##You won't be sorry!!
[t] Set up a breeze
##Just got around to setting up my wireless network yesterday
##Used the CD that came with it and setup was really simple
security[@]##Got the security set up using the "Set up a wireless network for a home or small office" feature of the "Wireless Network Connection" in Windows XP
##Product came up immediately and the signal is extremely strong
##Unless I have reliability issues, this product gets 5 stars from me
[t] Easy, Effective, A Great Purchase
##I am not a computer expert, but the set-up on this router was simple
speed[@]##The speed is lightning fast in you have an N card in your laptop
##I would rate this 5 stars!
[t] Great, fast, reliable wireless router
##There isn't that much to say about this router except that it does everything it promises, and does it well
##The wireless signal is strong, and the throughput is good, both wireless with an N client and the gigabit wired connection
##The router never goes down except in case of power outage
##This is more than what can be said for many other brands
##Update
[t] great value/price
##I tried this wireless router for about 2 weeks
##It has been working really well
##I don't have any heat problem with it
##I also compared DIR-655 with LinkSys WRT350n
##Pros
[t] Works great, IF you can get it set up.
##I purchased this based on the product reviews and to pair with the DSM-750 media center extender and the DAP-1522 Access Point/Bridge (plus a Netopia/Motorola modem/router in bridge mode for DSL)
##Based on the quality of the product, I would give it 5 stars as it works very well
##The signal strength is excellent, and I'm able to achieve 300 mbps on my network (though it usually hovers somewhere between 215 and 270) by setting it to 802
##11n only mode and to 40MHz
##In addition, I have it set to WPA2 only and to AES encryption
##The problem, as I alluded to in my title, is that the set-up was hassle
##Actually, the set-up was easy and fine, but getting to the point where I could set it up was a hassle
port[@]##I set up my Netopia device to work as a wireless bridge (a pain in its own right) and ran an ethernet cable from the WAN port to the WAN port on the router
##I then connected the router to my pc via ethernet cable
##Supposedly I should have been able to access the configuration page by typing in 192
##168
##0
##1 in a web browser
##However, I had no such luck
##I run Visa 32-bit
##I don't know if this was the issue or something else on my computer
##However, I could not bring up the configuration page no matter what
##I also couldn't set it up with the included CD
##After numerous struggles, I called the Dlink number
##Although this was pretty much useless, they did have me connect the router to another computer
##All I had available was an old laptop running Windows XP
##Miraculously, this worked
##I was able to access the config page and update the firmware
##In addition, I set it up to accept PPPoE, as I have DSL
##I then unhooked the router and plugged it into my PC running Vista and it has worked great since
##So five stars for a great product minus one for being a pain to connect
[t] HELP
##i need some help i really want to buy this router but i want to know if it has to be plugged into a computer via usb at all times?because i can not have thatplease help
[t] Only buy this if you do NOT need support!!!! - AWFUL!!!!
##I bought this item to replace an, almost, useless Linksys WRT5462
##I opened up this D-link router and IMMEDIATELY called their technical support phone number
##I got through to an automated system, well it allowed me into the support option then it stayed in a current loop
##SO, their phone support does NOT work because you cannot get through to a person
##AWFUL phone support!!! I tried TWO different phones to call them and called three times
##You cannot press any button to get through
##Again, you get caught in their automated system in a loop
##You'll get SLIGHTLY better phone support with Linksys but Linksys support is still is the WORST support I've EVER received
##But, at least I could get through to Linksys
##D-link now takes the GRAND prize for having the ALL TIME WORST support, due to NO way to contact anyone
##WOW, both companies have AWFUL support
##If you have an existing router don't change unless you're a networking genious
##You're pretty much on your own with either company
##Good luck!!!!!!!
[t] 801.11n
##This device does not give any wheres near the double the range in my environment over a 801
##11G product so I returned it
[t] Unfortunately, it was broken
##Theoretically, I liked this router
##Unfortunately, it was broken
##After spending many hours on the phone with customer services, I ended up returning this unit
[t] Link to good review
##First off, I don't own this router, but I had to rate it in order to post a review
##I gave it 5-stars to stay consistent with the other reviewers
##The reason I'm reviewing a router I don't own is because after reading the (very helpful) reviews from customers, I wanted to add a link to a "Barefeats" review that got me interested in this router since a few of you mentioned that there isn't a lot of info out on this router yet
##Barefeats is an excellent site and had this to say
[t] If You Run VISTA Avoid This Lemon - RUDE Tech Support Too
##If you're running VISTA and are using Microsoft Internet Explorer Ver
##7, forget this lemon
##It will not work with Ver
##7
##Also their tech support is not only incompetent but, to add insult to their product failure, they are disgustingly rude to boot!
[t] wireless router
##can't review at this time, my laptop is broken
##so i can't tell you how good this is or not
[t] NOT D-LINK AGAIN
##I almost bought this router
##THEN, I remembered the last D-Link router I bought (with two PC cards)
##That router (and PC card) would only work at a distance of less that three feet
##Anything beyond, with either card, would fail to connect EVERY time
##The D-Link *tech* told me there is no help for me because it worked at less than three feet and therefore is not their problem
##I called back and spoke to management who gave me the same answer
##I THREW THE WHOLE MESS IN THE TRASH
##WASTED MY MONEY
##If you want a product with support and a decent company behind it DON'T BUY D-LINK
[t] A stable, performing router
##I was forced to do some immediate research after frustration levels with my other router had finally peaked
##So far this router has outperformed technologically beyond my expectations
##I wholeheartedly recommend this product
##It is very easy to use for the novice, and gives a lot of good information for the expert
##The menu system is intuitive and gives the user a lot of control over their firewall should they need to modify any of the settings
[t] Very good router
##This is the 4th router I've owned (2 Linksys & 2 D-Link) and am very pleased with it
##It is extremely customizable with the ability to fine tune the firewall very carefully
##What impressed me the most was the improvement in wireless signal strength over my previous D-link DI-624 router, at least a two bar improvement in all areas of my home
##The included setup disk is helpful especially for people who've never setup a router before
[t] Works great
##I like this product
##I bought it after reading the comments from Amazon on this and other 802
##11n routers
##I'm very pleased
##I put the router and my DSL modem on a UPS system and I have had zero glitches -- even when the power flickers
##My regret has nothing to do with the router, unfortunately my Apple MacBookPro (rev2) has a 802
##11n wifi card that has severe limitations
##My old G4 Powerbook with a 802
##11g wifi card is much faster (and has benefitted from the new "n" router)
##Bummer
##Anyway, I do recommend this product
[t] Great Router.
##I've had this router for quite sometime now and I have had no problems since it has been set up
##I initially had some issues with setup but that was more my doing than the router having problems
speed[@]##I have my PS3 in my bedroom connected wirelessly and it doesn't suffer from lag or slow dl speed
##I love the invisibility option for wireless settings
##This might be a staple for routers, but this was my first router so I appreciate being able to keep my network private
##In the end it's a great product
[t] Works Great
##Installed with no problem
port[@][u]##I added a linksys 5  switch, added a Dlink Print Server
##Everything seems to be working fine
##Very happy
[t] Easy to setup and use
##I got this router for my father who just brought a new laptop with 802
##11n support
##His previous computer was plugged directly into the cable modem
##The entire setup process was very easy though I couldn't get the setup wizard CD to come up
##Maybe it's because the laptop was running Vista, but I didn't spend too much time trying to figure that part out
security[@]##The security feature also worked faultlessly
security[@]##I believe I tried the most security version first(WAP2?) and the laptop wouldn't connect
##Then I tried the next most secure option(WAP1?) and the laptop connected right up
##I moved the laptop around his two story house and there was no signal integrity issues
##It been up for a month or so now and he hasn't called me for any assistance
##I never ran a throughput test on this setup, so I can't comment on its performance
##But I suspect it's at least as fast as the ISP connection and that's fast enough for him
[t] Overall great router
##I swapped my old blitz router out with this one in a manner of minutes
##There are several different advanced options that are included with the router
##I have a wireless N ready laptop and it would not connect to the router at N speeds but for what I do, it doesn't make much difference
##I also purchased the cardbus wireless adapter which I was connecting at 100Mbps at 20 feet with 2 walls in between my computer and the router
##Overall I would recommend this router
##You can get a feel for the layout at http
[t] Great product
##This router was used to replace a Belkin, that didn't seem to have the range to get the job done
##Installation was quick and easy, set up was just as easy, and it works pretty good
##My laptop found it with no effort at all, and my daughter's desktop found after a little tweaking on her settings
software[@]##The enclosed software is better than average,Overall, I pretty happy
[t] no problems so far
##Performs as advertised
##Not using the "N" capabilities yet so can't comment on those
[t] Another Great D-Link product
##My family has been buying D-Link products for several years now
##We have wired and wireless ethernet cards, routers, adapters and not a single one has ever been a disappointment
##This router is no exception
##I think the N-Draft technology is still a little pricey, but overall, this item lives up to the expectations I had for it
##We got it out of the box, loaded the software, hooked it up, adjusted the settings, and our network was up and running
##We are running all XP, by the way
##No VISTA in this house
port[@][u]##I also like the fact that this router has a USB 
##If you like to put peripherals on a network with a flash drive, that feature is very handy
##I once spent 3 hours on the phone with D-Link customer support because of my own ignorance at the time, and I have only good things to say about them from that experience
##This router gives pretty good speeds, and now that I have put two Draft-N adapters on the network, I am realizing speeds ranging from 121 to 162
##That is much better than 54, which I was consistently achieving with my old router and adapters
##The integrity of the signal is much better also
##I have not yet carried my laptop to the other end of the house, but if I did, I am sure I would have a much better signal than I had with my old router
##In conclusion, I recommend this product to anyone who enjoys consistent connectivity and having good range with good speeds
##Its ease of use is a bonus
[t] Wireless Router
##This =link wireless router was easy to install and works very well
##I am very pleased with it
##Good choice
[t] I like it and easy to hook up and recoment it to anyone look for a good router
price[@]##works like it said good price and I love it
##Need a good router buy this one and you won't be sorry
[t] Flawless performance so far
##So far so good
##Bought to replace an ancient linksys
##Needed both wireless and wired and so far this seems to be getting the job done
[t] So Far So Good
##Just now replacing a 10 year old NetGear which was working fine
##But I just have too much wireless STUFF in the house now a days
##Haven't had any issues with this one yet
[t] One of the best router that the money can buy
##I purchase this router to my home
##It works flawlessly all the time
##The administration system have plenty of options
##Great product
[t] Works great
##This router works great
##It was super easy to set up, and never drops the signal
##I would have given it 5 stars if it would automatically update the firmware, which i had to figure out how to do the other day
##I don't know if it was important to do, but it was way out of date, and had the original firmware that it shipped with
##I would highly recommend this product
[t] Wireless system
internet[@]##Better item than what the internet company had and the cost was half of whatthey were selling
##Directions were easy to understand and covers the area I need
[t] Great Router, easy to install and set up.
security[@]##Easy to set security password, do not install without password protecting wireless
##Could be used by anyone if not protected and will make it very slow
[t] dead on arrival
##Purchased this item and attempted to install
##Could not link up after many attempts
##Called the help line and jumped thru many hoops only to be told that the product was defective and I would need to return
##Went with a different brand
[t] Best ever!
##Unit works very well
##Not one problem yet
##Product came well recommended by a tech for a cable company
##Price was also very reasonable
[t] Great Thru-put, easy to set up!!!
##Router was easy to set up (I didn't install any of the sw that came with it)
##Pretty much out of the box greatness
##I game online, and am pleased with the QOS options as well as the GigE interfaces
[t] Good and Bad
##I bought this router to support a new 802
##11N laptop that I ordered
##I used it to replace my very old Netgear router in my current wired network
##To test it out I tried a wireless connection with my Palm TX
##The bad is that it would only work if I got inches away from the router in the all modes configuration
[t] So Far So Good!.....
##Bought this router a couple of weeks ago and have had nothing but success out of it
speed[@][u]##Set up was fairly easy (always have a few minor problems), range was increased, and  was vastly increased! I have read reviews of people having trouble with Network Magic and this router but I myself luckily have had no problems and it works fine
##Network Magic just makes everything easy to maintain which is the only reason I use it
##Over all the DIR-655 is worth the upgrade if your looking for increased speed, range and no mysterious connection drops
[t] excellent, solid product
##I ordered this router after two other failed attempts with other vendors products
security[@]##It performed solidly out of the box and has easy to use wizards and other tools to properly configure security and the like
##I opted out of the wizards and used the manual configuration tools and was impressed by the variety of choices I can make
##I hooked up my 4 different wirless devices that operate on various channels (b,g and n) and all of them worked perfectly
speed[@]##Wirless speed (especially on the n) is excellent from my Dell 9400 running an embedded Intel wireless card
##An update of the firmware from D-Link's site only added new features and functionality
[t] A high Quality Product
##The D-Link DIR-655 is an excellent product that has performed flawlessly for me
##The setup instructions were excellent and easily understood
##I do not know the range limits of this device because it simply works anywhere I want to use my laptop computer in my home which is well over 2000 square feet
##This device has my highest recommendations
[t] Excellent wireless router
software[@]##Easy to install and with the enclosed software a breeze to connect a local network
[t] Works as Advertised
##Works fantastic
##We hooked it up right away with good instructions
##Now, more of our family can enjoy their own selections
##at the same time
[t] Performs well start up not so good.
##Performs very well now that it is installed
installation[@]##CD installation instructions would not work on my hard wired PC
installation[@][u]##A call to DLINK tech support was able to talk me through  without trouble after a 10 minute hold
security[@]##Performs really well once installed on my PC and my two wireless laptops and one wireless printer are able to access with no problems when the security password is enabled on them
##Through put and continuity of connections are excellent for all machines
[t] Did not work as expected
##We noticed when we received this router it had already been opened
##It was possibly a returned item because it didn't work because it didn't work for us
##We tried several times to set it up correctly, and every time there were problems
##After about three resets and no wireless connection ability, we disconnected it and connected our old G router
[t] paying for antennas
##I purchased this because I need a good WiFi connection
##This router wasn't any better than the NETGEAR Wireless Router-N300 (WNR2000) that it replaced
##I set it up on top of a wooden book shelf away from other electronics and the signal isn't any stronger than it was on top of a desk
speed[@]##I enabled the WiFi on several different devices to see what the strength and speed was and was unimpressed
speed[@]##The signal and speed dropped by almost half within 20 feet from the router
##My pc is about 15 feet away and gets 65mbps and the signal is at 92% which is pretty good, but it's been up and down (more down)
##I thought a router that boasted "14x faster speeds* and 6x farther range" would do better than the Netgear router I had before and it didn't
speed[@]##While the Wifi speed did go up significantly from the 55mbps I got with the Netgear router to 65mbps, it wasn't consistent enough for it to be useful
antennas[@]##I don't get any signal in the bedrooms (the antennas are pointed in that direction)
##It's pretty, has multiple antennas, and is wall mountable but isn't any better than any other router I've had before
##I'll be returning this immediately
[t] Works Great
##I have never installed a wireless router before
software[@][u]##I used the wizard on the  CD and it installed very easy, I am using the Vista Ultimate 64 byte OS which is updated
speed[@]##My cable modem [Motorola Surfboard sbv5222] with phone service, download speed is 10 Mbps
##It getting 130mbps to the USB adapter on the XP computer upstairs
##I would highly recommend to friend
##I am very pleased with this DIR-655 N router it performs as claimed
[t] D-Link DIR 655 Extreme N router
software[@]##Easy setup using the DLink software
##Wireless download and upload speeds were noticeably faster even without the Wireless N Adapter
##Once you add on a wireless N adapter (recommend using D-Link for compatibility issues) everything is great
software[@]##The enclosed Network Magic software allows you to easily setup a home network, and allows you to share folders on other computers without using the Windows built in version of network setup
[t] Took About A Year To Set Up
##Okay, maybe not that long
##But it did take me a good hour and a half to two hours to set this thing up
##However, after setting up, it hasn't stopped working on me yet (over the past 4 days) which is a plus, because the router I bought before this (Linksys G w/ speedbooster) sucked, and would stop working every 5 minutes
##So, all in all, I like this router
speed[@][u]##Can't really comment on any  enhancements or anything, however
speed[@]##(E) As far as speed, I'm usually working on 2 bars, which gives me about the same speed as my old ethernet connection
speed[@]##When I move around/have more bars, the speed is pretty blazing fast actually
[t] Performs well
##After trying to get different linksys working, this one works with no problems at all
##One of the previous issues that I was being able to support large amounts of bandwidth through the previous routers
##This router works without any issues
##There are a lot of configuration options for the device which makes the device configurable
##I have had this device for a while now and I haven't had to reboot it once
##I have been very happy with the device and would buy another one without giving it another thought
##This is the one to get if you are looking for a device with good range and configuration options
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##This product was easy to install and works excellently, however what was not easy was the registering the product with Verizon the cable company
##I spent about 4 hours trying to work with them to get the system up and running
[t] Rock Solid
##This router works right out of the box and I have not had a single problem from day one
##I have a xbox 360 and a macbook that were constantly dropping connections
speed[@]##Every wireless device can now stream at the same time with blazing speed
##This router has very similar firmware than its more expensive and flashy cousin (I believe that actual switch may be the major difference)
##IMO, If you need a wireless router today this is the most bang for the buck
[t] 5 Star Product - Worth Its Praises/Raves!!!
internet[@]##I was originally hesitant on purchasing such an expensive router for my multimedia needs around the house, but after setting this router up, I am glad I purchased this!!! I am still astounded by its reliability, range, speed, ease of installation, user interface, and configuration options!!!I had originally purchased a Linksys WRT160N Router and I had to return it after two days primarily because it kept dropping the wireless signal around the house every 4-6 hours not to mention it screwed up my internet connections the first time I had set-up the router which prompted me to call Linksys Tech Support for "manual" installation!Well, with this router, I have yet to encounter such problems!!! My laptop is a HP Pavilion dv6780se which comes with a a/b/g/n network card factory installed
##When the Linksys WRT160N Router did work, my laptop had speeds around (70-120)Mbps at about 20 feet away from the router with usually around 4 to 3 bars or signal strength
##Well, with this D-Link DIR-655, not only is my laptop being used at the same distance, but the speeds are now a CONSISTENT 130Mbps hovering at around 5 bars signal strength!!! In addition, I have another desktop PC in the master bedroom which is about 25 feet away using a Linksys Compact Wireless-G USB Adapter which got 54Mbps with the Linksys WRT160N at around 60-70% signal strength
##Now with the D-LINK DIR-655, not only is it getting 54Mbps, but it has a consistent 90% signal strength!!!Another thing I found great about this particular router is that its user interface (installation screen and self-configuration menu) is user friendly compared to those of my experiences with Linksys and Belkin
##Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this particular product/model due to its speed, range, ease of installation, reliability and a bevy of other features
price[@]##The only drawback to this was the exuberant price
##However, if you want something solid that should be future proof, THIS IS IT!!! I am definitely a D-Link customer now and do not even think of Linksys anymore!!!
[t] Right on the money...
##Just a promised
##Delivers a strong connection without any hassle
##If you are looking for an N router for a great price, you need not look any further
##Just buy it
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router.
##Thus far, this router has been fantastic
##Its small enough to hide out of the way, and has enough range to cover our 2000 square foot house
##The set-up for the router was easy, actual settings are somewhat daunting but the directions and customer service made tweaking all the settings to my liking a breeze
##If your looking for a router to replace your broken one, or simply to update with the times then look no further
[t] Good Router - But problems setting up
##Took me a while to get the router to work
##There's a problem with Surfboard cable modems made by Motorola
##It would not acquire the IP address
##After googling I discovered that there is a problem with the firmware version 1
##10
##Needed to upgrade to 1
##11
##The cable modem also has to be turned off for a least 5 minutes before you connect and turn on the router
##After I did this it worked fine
##It seems that I've had a few wireless disconnects, but I haven't had to recycle the power like I had to do with my old Linksys
[t] D-link is d-lightful
##Easy set up
##Excellent reception
##5 stars
##I am not a computer geek, but I had no problems with install
[t] Router
##works great,Next cents router works great have no problems that needed and it works on all my gadgets
##Would know what to do without it for my wireless connections
[t] Fast and Includes many features
##I was able to turn my regular usb printer into a wireless printer
speed[@]##Has fast speed but has a mind of its own
[t] 100% functional right out of the box!!!
##100% Fully functional as described
##Slightly stronger than my older N300 (FastE) router
##A 100~240VAC adapter would be appreciated though cheap 12VDC, 2A aftermarket adapters can be sold easily
[t] Great router.
##I've had this router a grand total of 2 days and it's already way way better than my last router
##Not to knock the last one; but this is far superior
[t] Good, but consider Airplay
##This is a great router
##but i might have considered something from apple that is compatible with their Airplay system, so i could setup wireless computer speakers
[t] Nightmare!
##My daughter loves her D-Link and recommended the brand to me
##Upon installation, my Windows 7 64 bit desk top computer never recognized it, although it passed the setup tests
##Even though it's a wireless computer, it required an ethernet connection to be on line with this D-Link DIR 655 wireless router
##I called up customer support and was on hold for close to an hour
##When someone finally got to me they didn't have any answers and said I should call HP, since they could not help
##Like I'm going to call HP and be charged for troubleshooting for this gadget that doesn't work! I don't think so
##I uninstalled it and packed it up to send back to Amazon, only to realize my second computer no longer had access the internet, because of D-Links shareport utility
##So I tried to uninstall that, but because it's always running in the background, the uninstall was halted
##My second computer still can't go online unless I remove the cable from the first computer and plug it into the second computer
##So now I'll have to buy an uninstall utility to get rid of the garbage left by D-Link on my computer before I do anything else
##Bottom line
[t] I am sending back a twice RMA'ed router that died three times.
##I can't understand how this router is considered usable
##I was lucky that i got to get a refund on this because after trying to get RMA hardware on this new purchase, I could not get one that would stay online for more than a week
##It took me two tries to get this done and I had to throw in the towel because I can't get a refund after so much time passes with Amazon
##I am voting with my wallet on this one
[t] a good upgrade
##This router seems to work fine
##I have better signal strength but may still need a repeater
##I have my desktop in the basement and get coverage to about 60% of the house
[t] Great Router
##Has great range and a lot of features
##Would recommend this router to anyone that wants a home network and use a wireless printer
[t] D-Link Router
##Excellent product
##Very easy to set up and get running
##No problems what so ever
##Exceptional range, can be anywhere in the house and outside, outstanding
##Very statisfied
[t] Wanted to Like it, but....
##I've used 4 other D-links all with good success
##Decided to try "N" to help stream HD video from my upstairs PC's that I cannot reach with Cat6
##This router was a snap to set up
##I set it up as a WAP only for N
##leaving my older DGL-4300 dedicated to G
##I was up and running in no time, one PC showing 270, the other showing 300mbs
##Then after 3 days, it just quit working
##So, in trying to restart it, I noted that it would not save settings
##Not even the time, date, password
##Factory resets did no good
##Nor would it accept a firmware upgrade (this was a V4 running the 1
##21 firmware)
##A few days fooling with D-link support is what turned me off
##I did not expect much from them
##But this was pathetic
##They blamed my PC, my O/S, my Browser
##but would not come close to saying they had bad hardware or firmware
##They were clueless
##yet if you search D-link forums, you find many people having the same issue as me
##router not saving settings
##I decided life is too short to put up with this, so I sent it back to Amazon
##Thank Them for great return policy! I have no doubt this router works well for many
##Perhaps it is just the recent Hardware version 4 and the firmware
##But, it is time for me to try another brand
##I'll cross my fingers and hope I get lucky
##I know that all of them seem to have their share of issues
##By the way
##When it comes to web surfing, N is only an eyeblink faster than G
streaming[@][u]##I was just about to benchmark  video on N, when the router failed
[t] Great product but customer service is horrible.
port[@]##After a lot of research got this router mainly because it had a USB port on the router and have an external hard drive from Toshiba so thought could connect it to the router and have access to all music, movies and pictures on the hard drive
##Overall satisfied with the ease of setup, the speed, and the looks of the router
##Called customer support to get the hard drive to connect, very rude and looks like every thing I asked for was my problem and they could not do anything about it
##If anyone know about how to set this up or a link where I can find instructions to set up the hard drive I would appreciate that
price[@][u],port[@]##If this does not work I rather get a regular N router without the USB port for about half the 
[t] A Great Improvement
##I recently installed this D-Link router in my home
##We were having problems with our three year old "g" router and we had to try something new
##Someone with much more expertise than I have recommended an N router and it really has done the trick
##Set up was a bit complicated, but not impossible
##The signal is much, much stronger than it had been in the house
##The signal does not suddenly "drop off" when you get farther away from the source
##Overall, I am very happy
internet[@]##My entire family has noticed the improvement--from itouch users to internet radio users
##It was worth the expense
[t] Solved my dropped connections on my Frankenstein system
##My PC is homebuilt, over 5 years old, has a hodge podge of old and new parts and accessories attached and in use
##My old router was an ancient Linksys wireless N model
##After adding a bluetooth receiver to the deskttop pc via usb and networking two wireless laptops to my home network and having both 900MHz and 2
##4GHz cordless phones in the house, the linksys just couldn't handle all the signals and would drop often enough that it frusrated my cheap ass to buy a new modern G router
##I bought this model because of reviews [
##]
installation[@]##It was straight plug and play (I use XP professional) and have not had a signal loss since its installation (6 months ago)
##In my book that's a great value and I could kick myself for not doing it much sooner
[t] Solved my wireless connectivity problems
##I bought one of the early Belkin Pre-N routers which at the time was the only router that I could find that could offer reliable connections throughout my house
##A month ago it died
##I wasn't too worried since I knew that now the full-fledged "N" routers were cheap and easy to find
port[@]##Having had a good experience with Belkin, I first tried the Belkin N+ router with the USB port
[t] Very happy with DIR-655 + Roku HD
##I purchased this item as part of an upgrade to my home wireless system
##With my old router, tethered to one end of my house by a cable port, I could barely receive a wireless signal on my laptop while seated at the other end of my medium-sized house
##Not only did I want to improve upon the range, my plans included installing a wireless HD Roku device to stream movies
##I bought a new router (Motorola SB6120 SURFboard) to replace my rented Comcast modem and connected it to the D-Link DIR-655
##Installation took maybe an hour altogether, including 25 minutes on the phone with Comcast as they reset my modem
##Now my wireless signal is much stronger and more reliable
##I have the Roku device installed on side of my home opposite from the router and it streams HD-quality movies with no problem
##Besides the Roku, I run a Dell laptop with Windows XP, two iPhones and an Ooma VOIP phone system - all of which have transitioned to the new router seamlessly and with improved coverage
##I don't understand what the other reviewer is talking about with the unit getting hot
##I've been running mine for about two weeks now, and it's cool to the touch all day long
##Perhaps he failed to remove the thin, clear plastic wrap that cover the vents?
[t] Works as advertised
##Purchased this about 6 months ago to replace an older wired router
##This was my first wireless router and setup couldn't have been easier
price[@]##The range is good and price was reasonable
##Absolutely no problems so far
[t] so far so good
##I read the negative reviews, but I had none of the issues listed in the negative reviews
##This router has a lot of features, which can make it take longer to set up than one with few features, but the interface seems decent enough
software[@]##Also, the CD lacks any set up software for the MAC
speed[@]##I get great reception and great speed on my 10M cable modem
##Also, I have not had any dropped connections or had any need to reboot the router
##I use this for 2 laptops (dell and macbook pro) and one PC using cable
[t] Excellent Router - Just be careful if you have Actiontec M1000
speed[@]##This is an excellent router that has a great speed and range
##The setup is easy as well, except that - this is no fault of DIR-655 - my Actiontec M1000 model for Qwest DSL did not like the presence of DIR-655 and threw up a tantrum, which added layers of trouble to get them to work together
##If it had not been for M1000, the setup would have taken five minutes
##So be careful if you have the same modem
##There are lots written about M1000 not getting along with routers, not just D-Link's but other manufacturers' also, so Google if you use one
##The USB SharePort feature is very nice, and allows sharing of our printer that is not Wi-Fi
##It is true that while one PC is connected to the SharePort other PCs on the same network have to wait for the first PC to get off the connection
##However, as a user of a rather simple home network, this is not at all a problem to our household
##It's a great something extra that I did not even know came with DIR-655 when we bought one
##A pleasant surprise it has turned out to be
##I would buy a DIR-655 again
##It is a great value, in my opinion
[t] For Windows Vista just truble !!
##After 6 hours try installing on my computer (HP 3800 Athlon dual core, windows Vista) was imposible to run this router, spend three hours with d-link support and a trip to return this item, I will rate this product less one star, D-link support was rude, not a good experience, I got this router because the feedback this product have, maybe the same thing you do right now, but guess what? the router finally work like a champ was linksys WRT300N, this router don't have a really good feedback but work great on windows Vista, i take the time to write this review to save time to you, was terrible spend 6 hours trying to install this router!!
[t] Except for minor quirks, works great
##I originally replaced my 3 bridgedBuffalo Technology Wireless-G High Power Router and Access Point with High Gain Antenna WHR-HP-G54routers with 3 of Buffalo'sBuffalo Technology Nfiniti Wireless-N Essential High Power Router & Access Point WHR-HP-G300Nrouters, since I was so happy with the WHR-HP-G54s
##The new routers worked fine, except they absolutely refused to maintain a wireless bridge connection encrypted with WPA2/AES
##It would work for a few minutes, then it would drop, and the client router would have to be power-cycled
##I returned those routers and replaced them with this one, plus twoD-Link DAP-1522 Xtreme 4-Port GigaBit Selectable Dual Band Draft 802
##11n N Duo Wireless Bridge/Access Points
##They work great, and the signal strength, for whatever reason, is much better using these than I had with the Buffalos in the same place
##It seemed silly to me to buy one router and two different devices that ONLY do bridging, but, since that's the setup I needed, I didn't care that much, as long as it worked, and as long as I could secure the wireless bridge with WPA2/AES
##My setup is working great - my main router is in an upstairs office in the middle of the house; one bridge is downstairs on the left side of the house; the other is upstairs at the other end of the house
##There are just a few minor quirks that you should know about before getting this router
[t] Only made it 2 years
##Got kicked off a lot
##Had to call customer service to update it within a year
##Took forever
##Look elsewhere
##Not recommended
[t] If you're a layman this router and this company is not for you
software[@]##Okay, I admit it, I am better with writing code than making hardware work (I am a software developer with a local company)
##At my place of employment when something goes wrong, I call the hardware guys and let them play with the hardware
##But I can't do that at home
##I am the driver at the wheel
##So I looked for something that was supposed to be fairly easy to install
##That turned out to be this router
##I ran through the install routine provided and got no Internet connection
##I called the company's help desk and the several persons with whom I worked, all of whom had language issues (sorry, but that's the truth, unpleasant as it is to hear) set me through twelve grueling hours of "do this, turn that off, reset the other thingie, disconnect and reconnect"
##and so on
##Finally after the twelfth hour and partial success, I was told that the hardware was defective
##DLink provided me with a processing number and so kindly informed me that it was my responsibility to pay for the shipment of the defective part back to them while they shipped a new piece of hardware to me and the fates help me if I didn't ship the defective piece back to them!I received the part today and spent another three hours on the phone with those DLink help desks with the wonderful American accents ("When did you buy it?/The day after Thanksgiving/July first, then?"
##ah, but I digress)
##Finally I was told that the hardware wouldn't connect with the Internet because of some issues with my ISP
##Never mind that the first piece did finally connect with the Internet
##its problems were in other areas
##So I dutifully called up my ISP (Hughesnet for those who care) and was told that no, the problem was somewhere else
##I have better things to do with my time than spend 15 hours getting a router up and running
##DLink's help desk stinks and their policies toward their customers aren't much better
##If you are a hardware master then this box will probably serve you well
software[@]##If you are like me and prefer software mastery to hardware mystery, give this product a wide berth
[t] Not a good performer
##This router's wireless capability is poor
##I replaced a Linksys wireless router in the same spot and signal strength is half or less
##LAN performance is slow
##It also has in interface that makes this router difficult to configure
[t] Worked sort of
##The USB was hit and miss when it would work but the unit kept dropping "N" so when I turned "N" off it would work but then what's the point of this unit?D-Link customer support was good even though English is not their first language, communicating with them was easy and helpful
##I returned the unit to Amazon and the process was painless and handled very well by them, they are a great company to to business with, I give Amazon 5 stars
[t] Great product - some shortcomings
##There appears to be an issue using NetTalk Duo with this router
internet[@]##There are no issues with the other devices in our house (ipods, laptop, PCs, BluRay Player), but I have been losing my phone connection with NetTalk, when my cable internet connection is cycled
##I probably shouldn't blame this product except that there are others to choose from while that is not the case with NetTalk
[t] Share-port works with my multifunction
##I have had this router for only 3 days or so, but I am very pleased with it
##The share-port feature works with my MFC for printing as well as for scanning
##Overall I am happy with my choice, no complaints whatsoever (so far)
[t] Depenable wireless connection for all our computers
##We have a ranch style home that is spread out including a full basement - coverage is excellent
##We own both PC and Mac systems and both have great/dependable wireless connection using this wireless router
##Delivered on time and would recommend this supplier
[t] Product actually works well but support is beyond horrible.
speed[@]##I purchased this product to replace another dlink router simply because of the faster "N" wifi speed
internet[@]##Upon installing it didn't detect my Verizon FiOS internet connection
##I know Verizon uses DHCP so the connection should be detected by the router as soon as you plug it in, so after I verified there was nothing wrong that I did, I called dlink support
##After several hours of very annoying questions that were designed for someone with no technical experience, they finally told me the router had a problem and asked me to reflash the firmware (basically means to reinstall it's operating system)
##I did as they said and still had the same problem, so they told me to replace the router
##Amazon was happy to send me a replacement and even shipped it the fastest way possible, but the new one had the same problem
##I then did a google search for "Dlink dir 655 Verizon FiOS" and got thousands of hits
##The first one I opened had the same problem and the simple solution as follows
##Reinstall old router and click "release DHCP", the install new router
##It was that simple and it worked!!!Basically, in case you don't understand this it means that Verizon detected my old router and would only allow connections to it (probably to stop someone from stealing my internet), so by releasing the settings, it allowed my new router to accept the connection
##The point is that dlink SHOULD have fixed this within the first 30 seconds of support, and I logged over 3hours of phone time on Christmas day and the following day and ultimately told me to replace the router
##So now I have a working router, but more problems
internet[@]##I used the same settings as my old router had, same WEP encryption settings, IP addresses and all the other custom settings and all my computers had internet
##Among these were 3 laptops
##Two of them had 802
##11g wireless adapters and one had 802
speed[@]##11n wireless (faster), but all three were connected with the router at "g" speeds, NOT the "n" speed which was the whole reason for buying the router
##The first support person I called told me that I had a single band router and it wasn't capable of making "n" connections
##I argued that the product specs claim that it does and I was very angry to do all this to only be told their "n" router can't do "n" connections
##I ended up quoting from their own web page, then was put on hold and disconnected
##The following day their support was unavailable due to techincal problems, but I finally got a support person the following day who also did a lot of testing and finally referred me to senior level support where they told me I had to change my band settings from 20ghz to auto20/40ghz and it would fix the problem, but it did not
##The call time between support and holding was over 2 hours that day
##I finally went back to google and found that the wireless 802
speed[@]##11n standard didn't support WEP encryption, so as soon as I changed the encryption from WEP to WPA the "n" laptop connected at "n" speed
##Ironically, I had planned on upgrading my encryption to WPA anyway, but it's "usually" not wise to make more then one change at a time
##I wanted to get one thing working before changing the second
##Thats usually very good advice, but not in this case
##However for dlink support AND senior level support to have missed this is unforgivable
##In my opinion the product wasn't bad at all, but I've never seen support this bad and I've been building computers since about 1990
##So, at this point I'm not even sure if I'm going to keep this unit because every morning when I wake up the wifi is offline and not transmitting and I have to unplug/replug the router to get it working
##I don't know if any of the issues I reported already are related to that problem or not, so I'm going to give it a few more days before I decide
##I rarely take the time to report things here, but I felt for all the time they wasted of mine and the total inability to diagnose extremely simple problems warranted spending even more time to warn fellow users about the kind of support to expect if you buy this product
##Also, on an unrelated dlink issue I purchased two dlink Wifi "n" cards for my other laptops here at amazon
##They arrived brand new in their boxes and when I was on hold for support, I looked them up on the dlink website to read about them, only to find they were discontinued on september 2009 and NO LONGER ON SALE in the USA
##Well wtf did I just buy them if they aren't on sale? I asked if they would replace them with models that are supported and they refused
##How a company is allowed to suddenly cancel the warranty of a product without giving a buyer any way of telling by looking at the product should be illegal
##There is no expiration date on the product, so this makes me believe dlink does business on the ancient principle of Caveat emptor (let the buyer beware)
##For those interested, the cards I mention are dlink DWA-642http
[t] Works just as advertised
##I bought this router to replace a failing linksys router that had stopped functioning properly
##This was a breeze to set up and works great
[t] Researcher
##I have been searching router for many different kinds of brand
##Extreme N is currently most useful for wireless condition
##Comparing to other series of D-link product, DIR-655 is relatively acceptable price, although it is still a bit expansive
##I use DIR-655 for 1 month already; the wireless range works pretty well because I live in a studio apartment
##However, I will move to two floors house tomorrow, and it would be interesting whether the router will work fine or not
##The Wi-Fi works for whoever needs to use wi-fi, which is good to have it
port[@]##The usb port supports to use public harddrives, printers, etc
##DIR-655 includes most of funtion I need
##Hope you will find this helpful
[t] Powerful versatile wireless router
##I was using the Extreme Gaming Router DGL-4500D-Link DGL-4500 Xtreme N Selectable Dual Band Draft 802
security[@],streaming[@]##11n Gaming Router, and it worked great until I started streaming HD media plus with with several wireless security cameras, it began to freeze
##This router not only has a more powerful processor, but it's simultaneous dual-band wireless allows me to stream several HD media streams wirelesly or over the Gigabit network
security[@]##Great security features, overall excellent product
[t] Had trouble with this one.
##First off, I like D-Link products and have been using them for years
##I've probably owned 15 of their devices, including wireless routers, without any failures
##However, I've just gone through two different DIR-655s with the same problem
##Both DIR-655 routers in a small office had reliability issues
[t] unreliable usb port
port[@]##Just as I read in many other reviews, the usb/printer port either doesn't work or is unreliable
##After finally getting it to work I was happy but not for long
##It may work for a while then you have to play around with it then it's okay for a while again
##I finally just disconnected the printer and said to hell with it
port[@]##If I had to do it over I would get the model under it with out the usb port or get the comparable ASUS unit
[t] Got what I paid for
##Very happy with the unit
##Was changing an older Linksys that runs like an oven
##This thing is great, and really helps me get on with my work rather than working on supporting it
[t] Pleased with router
##I was a little confused during set up but finally 'got it'
##I get a strong signal
speed[@]##I was expecting higher speed than 54 mbps, but that is all I get
##Somewhat pricier than other products, but reliability is the main thing
[t] Great SOHO device
##I bought this router to work with a IP PBX VOIP server
##Technical support has been great so far and they helped me to configure it to accommodate voice applications
##It is now a couple of months and no issues
##At least for soho voip deployment I think I made the right choice
[t] Super Easy to Setup & It Works Like a Charm
##I had used a very reliable Linksys modem for years, but needed to update
##Upon in-depth research on many sites, I came across the D-Link modem which had very positive customer reviews on Amazon and decided to make the switch - a great deal helped the decision as well
[t] Worked awesome until . . .
##I loved this router for nearly 13 months
##Then suddenly for no reason ever 10 seconds i would lose connectivity , I tried everything I reset, updated the firmware installed some hacked firmware
##Still nothing, I did the setup like a dozen times all to no avail
port[@]##The router eventually went as far as not connecting when my router was plugged to an Ethernet port
##Then for some reason i got the idea to restart and do the basic setup
##Somehow that worked for me? Still not really sure as to why
##It still is finicky and it will soon be replaced i think as i'm not willing to suffer much longer
##So I guess I can break it down to pro's and con'sPro's-When it was running very fast-setup was simple and there are so many features-Does a great job of prioritizing packets even when downloading torrents I never had a problem with my VOIP on 5mb internet- handle quiet a bit of load without any real slowdownsCon's-Less then help d-link search site-Average range and only 1 frequency-Slow usb access to my portable hd drive-short life with no explainable reason for hardware failure or restore
##-at the time of purchase it was expensive
[t] Difficult Setup
##I bought the DIR-655 thinking that set-up would be a snap
##I used the set-up CD provided, however I could not get past the Router's login screen (you don't need a logon and password to get past the login screen if none has been set-up) I tried the IP address access on my other 2 pc's with no luck
##I called DLINK support who offered suggestions which did not work
##I was about to give up when I connected my work laptop to the router and finally got to the setup menu
##My prior router a DLINK-604, never had this issue
##If you do a Google search on this problem you'll find many users with the same experience
##Configuring the Wireless side of the router also proved problematic and was worth a call to DLINK support
##Overall the reception in my 2 story house is very good, even with the router in the basement
##I would not recommend this router due to the unsolvable issue with accessing the router's setup
[t] Great For Streaming Video, Set-Up Difficult
##After nearly two-years my old Netgear G router died, so seeing that this D-Link N router was relatively inexpensive and, from the reviews, very popular, I ordered it
streaming[@][u]##On my old router,  Netflix through my PS3 was slow, and could take probably 15 seconds to start, but this D-Link does it in no more than 3 seconds
installation[@][u]##I did hit a little snag on initial 
software[@],installation[@]##The accompanying CD installation software failed to set-up the router automatically, and the screen instructed me to do a manual set-up
##I'm not very tech-savvy, but I did manage on my own to get it working after a couple of hours
installation[@]##After three-weeks of use I'm very happy with it, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a router, but with a warning to the novice that installation can be difficult, though, once it's up and running it's fast
[t] Great Wireless Router
##I have been using this router for about a month now and it has been fantastic
##The set-up was super easy
##Connectivity is great and have not had any issues
##I have two computers, two iphones, ps3, wireless printer, and the USB Shareport with two hard drives and another printer connected through a USB hub and everything has worked fine
##It took a little work to get the Shareport to work, but now it is working great
##I have not had to use many of the advanced features so I can't really comment on those
##For a home router, this one seems to be one of the best
##I give it 5 stars!
[t] It's a great router
##I've been using this for over a year now, no problems whatsoever
##The router is on the second floor, I have my gaming PC wired into it, and on the first floor is my PS3 (Netflix), my TV (Amazon VoD), and my Vudu box (awesome hi def movies, pandora, and more)
##Anyone who knows about Vudu knows that you need a good connection if you want to stream their top HD format, and that hasn't been a problem
##Looking at the negative reviews, I can't help but think that those people simply didn't set it up right, didn't follow directions, or something along those lines
##My wireless signal is going through a wall/floor at a direct distance of around 25 feet, and the signal is strong
##I can talk on my cell phone, use my laptop, do anything and nothing interferes with the signal
##An earlier comment mentioned disconnects, but I seriously doubt a router would cause a disconnect by itself unless it was resetting for some reason
##I also don't believe the router gets overly hot
##Mine has been on for over a year, and it's still going strong, no lag in intensive games and no disconnects due to the router
##Disconnects are mainly going to be caused by a cable connection issue, or by the laptop itself
##Read the directions on how to set this thing up, they aren't hard, but if you don't do them correctly or just decide to wing it on your own, then any problems are likely your fault and not the machine's
##As a bit of history, I've been using routers since about 2000
##I've gone through a few Linksys routers in that time, and this time I really needed wireless and wanted to make sure I had the fastest signal possible in wireless
##This router fit the bill, and I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever in getting it
software[@]##I was a little leery at first because I had always used Linksys, but this Dlink router is even better, and came with a really handy software utility called Network Magic
##Everything about the router exceeded my expectations
##Again, follow the instructions on setting it up
##Don't play with other settings unless you know what you're doing and/or have already established that the unit is working
##This was my first wireless router and that's all I did at first, and I got everything set up and working wirelessly with the router within an hour (TV, PS3, Vudu, Laptop)
##And I'm serious, no problems at all with the system since day 1
##it's been close to a year and a half, iirc
##Anyone that has a problem with this router will probably have a problem with any router
##Unfortunately, I can't comment on their customer service because I haven't needed any
##It's a great product
##If you need a wireless router, this is the one to get unless they have a newer model out
[t] Great router - everything works flawlessly, easy setup, good price
##I initially purchased a more expensive Belkin router (Play MAX) but promptly returned it after spending hours trying to get it to recognize my printer on the network
##Then I opted for this less expensive D-Link model and got everything up and running in no time
##Highly recommended
[t] Nice Router - Big improvement
internet[@]##I bought this router to upgrade from the lousy Netgear router provided by my cable internet provider
##This thing is a big improvement with solid reception, high speed, and ease of set-up
security[@]##My prior router only supported WEP security, so I appreciate the WPA security provided
##All-in-all a strong unit and easy to setup
[t] Don't waste your money if you want to transfer large video files between PC and NAS
speed[@]##I bought this product expect to improve the transfer speed between the PC and the NAS DNS321
speed[@]##It turns out that the transfer speed wasn't that great (800~900MB / min)
##Also, it isn't 100% compatible with the NAS since it doesn't support jumbo frame
price[@][u]##For the  of $65, I keep it anyway to help the economy
[t] Great router, but USB share port utility very lame
##I really like the router, but one of the main reasons I purchased it was because I wanted to share a printer on our network through the USB shareport utility
##It did occasionally work, but in general, using it just leads to frustration
##It will detect the printer, but not connect you to it without rebooting the router and offering sacrifices of burnt ram chips to the DLINK gods
##I finally just reconnected the printer to my computer and share it on the network
##Much less of a headache, much more dependable
##Other than that, its great! I especially like that it has a "guest" network that allows you to give visitors a password to a network totally separate from your home network
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme
port[@]##Conflicts when using with Linksys wireless connected to D-Link port
##Linksys sync's right up and D-Link will not
##Customer service pushed it for off for me to contact Linksys, so next time I buy Linksys
[t] Very pleased with this router
##I've always had problems with my NetGear router dropping and hanging, and had been getting much worse lately, so finally decided to replace it
##Glad I did! I've had the D-Link DIR-655 installed for around 4 weeks, and so far it hasn't dropped once
##We typically have 1 computer connected via ethernet and 3-4 via wireless, plus a network printer
security[@]##Speed is fantastic, security appears very robust, and has tons of features like the USB attachment
##I setup the USB attachment to a Seagate external drive, and with the D-Link SharePort provided software, within around 30 minutes I had 3 computers able to use the drive attached to the router's USB - very convenient! Setup also worked fine, just followed the quick install guide software, it did pretty much everything, was very intuitive
##Very happy with this router!
[t] It was great for about 1.5 years.
##I bought this router from amazon in the beginning of 2009
##Here I am in October of 2010 and now I get disconnected every day, sometimes several times a day, and I have to manually reboot it
##I don't like the lack of key features, like monitoring and managing broadband usage of individuals on the network
##The warranty is for only 1 year
##The problem is that the router worked for 1
##5 years
##I thought I was paying up to future-proof etc
##I ended up throwing money down the drain! I'll never buy D-link products again!
[t] Love IT!
##Fantastic Product! The Instructions SHOULD Say Hook Laptop To Internet Using OLD Router THEN Follow Directions!!! That Fact Seemed Unclear Until I Figgered It OUT! LOL!
[t] Too much for the average user
##I used to be computer techie kind of person; I've built computers, fixed computers, installed networks -- but it's been awhile and I don't have any interest in getting that technical anymore
##That being said, I handle most computer related tasks pretty well and I found this router fairly challenging on some of the advanced issues
##It's much more than the average home user needs
##I originally bought it thinking we were going to switch our phone service to VoIP, and I liked the hard drive sharing option
security[@]##The WPA security features ended up interfering with a lot of the stuff we have hooked up to wireless, so DLink's answer was just to switch it to WEP mode
##We still have things that used to work on our old router that don't work with this one
software[@]##The SecureSpot software built into the router is really annoying and I disabled that too
##For what I'm using the router for, a more basic model would have done the job
[t] Dropped WAN and LAN connections.
##I have been using this router for about 9 months
##I purchased it to replace an older Linksys
##I keep losing time, dropping WAN and LAN connections
##I have taken the same equipment directly to the modem without any dropped connections
##I have called and spoken to Tech support about a dozen times without any real help! They merely keep saying upload the firmware again
##D-link also offered to look at my router if I would pay the costs and could not give me any temporary replacement or time they would need to debug my router
##I am going to replace the router very soon!
[t] What Crap
##This is ANOTHER great router that the manufacturer has dumbed down in order to sell their newer more expensive products
##If you get a hardware version A3 or earlier you'll have one of the great ones
##If you get an A4, which is what they're making now, well, stick with your old router
[t] d-link owes me headache meds
##level
[t] Does everything I wanted
##This is my first experience with a wireless router, and it does everything I wanted it to
internet[@]##I can access the internet on my laptop from the other side of my house, and my son has his XBox 360 connected to it (also from the other side of the house), and there's no interference between the gaming system and the computer
##Very nice!
[t] D_Link DIR-655
##I Really wanted one of these routers to replace my old Linksys BEFW11S4 but I was never able to get it to recognize my ethernet ports
##All it would say it that there is no ethernet connection
##I bought it used and thought it was faulty and so I bought a new unit from Amazon
##Same story, it would not see my ethernet ports on my computer
##D-Link technical support could not do anything for me so I returned the router and bought a Linksys WRT600N which arrived on Friday the 13th
##It immediately recognized my ethernet connection and I was soon set up and running 130mbps at 5' from the router and 270mbps down on the first floor kitchen table
##I am happy with what I've got but am a little disappointed that I couln't get the D-Link DIR-655 to operate with my system
[t] Works fne
##I bought this to replace a Netgear unit that failed in less than a year
##It was easy to install and so far works perfectly, but it's only a month old
##Signal is good throughout my house (2 story)
##I bought this specific unit because I have a few Gigabit wired ethernet computers
##Gigabit seems to work fine but I haven't acutally timed it
##Incidentally, a (non-computer-literate) friend of mine happened to buy the same unit and managed to install it without a problem (i
##e
##without having to call me!!)So, so far it gets 5 stars
[t] Best WiFi router
##I bought this router at Bestbuy after reading comments about it
##I will not say anything about any other router, even though I had a Netgear and a Linksys, but this baby is the best
##The pictures don't do justice to it
##It is much better looking sitting on a table with those blue LED contrasting with the white color of the router
##One thing I need to add is that you don't need to install anything in your computer, as a matter of fact, I don't care what is on those DVDs, every WiFi router I get, I don't even open the DVD, you don't need to install more crap in your computer
##Just open your browser, point it to 192
##168

##1(Linksys is 192
##168

##1), and bingo! You are in the router
##This router don't require password the first time, of course, you need to change it right away
##From here you can change anything you want assuming you know what you are doing
##Leave most of the setting the way they come
security[@]##Usually my Wifi is set to filtered MAC addresses, and not to broadcast the SSID, that's it! That is correct, don't enable the security feature unless you are a paranoid dude, this slow down your connection
##Happy WiFing!Alex Form Los Angeles
[t] D- link router
##Performing beautifully, at present two laptops (wireless)and two desktops (wired)and have my printer connected (wireless) (D-link USB utility)setup was easy and clear
##Would recommend
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
[t] Thumbs Up
##Installed without any problems
##It replaced my Linksys Wireless G network and it's extra range is very good
[t] Good router
##I have always used DLink Router
##Started with DI-624, then DIR 615 and the DIR-655 after the older units exhibited problems that it's not worth repairing
##It served mePROS
[t] Home network speed is great
internet[@],speed[@]##This product is good especially if you are looking for a speed home network wireless router otherwise internet is okay compared to others
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##It works, the support staff / forums could be better
##by lots and lots
port[@]##I have been soured from dealing with D-Link over this product, at first they were mis advertising the USB port on the back and a whole host of other marketing 'bait and switches'
##but in the end I got it to do what I wanted it to do (from the start) so
##it works
##to bad there is no support behind it
[t] Great D-Link Router
##The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router is the best router I have ever owned
##1
[t] Nice Router
##I have owned Linksys routers over the last 10 years, and I finally broke ranks and decided to purchase this one based on the reviews from this site
##I must say, that this is a very good product
##Installation for me was very simple
software[@][u]##I manually configured it, and did not use the set-up  that comes with it
##I have had this router for two weeks now, without any issues
##As far as range goes, I live in a 5,0000 square foot two story home
##The signal is good thruout my entire house, even though the router is in the basement!!!!! I have to say, that the signal is not as strong as my linksys router which was attached to an old linksys wireless signal booster
##Now I know why these boosters were deemed illegal by the FCC
##Although this is not an issue form me, I will try to figure out how to hook the booster up to this router
##Booster has two antenna connections, router has three
##If anyone knows how to do this, I would greatly appreciate the help
[t] D-Link N-wireless router
##The product arrived in good condition but was defective
##Two Microsoft engineers worked with me for several hours over two days to get this router to work in my network
##No luck
##We returned the router and purchased a new Netgear N-router
##It was installed in 10 minutes and works perfectly
[t] Extreme Wireless Router is good
##This router is easy to set up, and works great
##It comes with a set up disk with a set up wizard
##Also a brief guide for manual set up
##Security is also provided, but is a little more obscure in the set up
[t] Works Great
##Fast easy set-up, no problems so far have had it 2 months
##Would highly recoommend
price[@]##Great price at Amazon got an extra 30 dollars off with Amazon visa
[t] Rich set of features, short life span
##I purchased this router April 2009 and replaced it February 2011 a few months after it it became flakey and required occasional restarts by disconnecting the power
##The router lived it's short life connected to a line conditioned UPS
##The NAS, cable modem, network switch and other peripherals that shared the same UPS in the cool basement are still in operation today (Nov 2011), therefore this router's life was short in comparison
##The router does have a rich set of features not always offered by competitors and setup is on the easier side for a router with this rich set of features
##I gave 3 stars due to the short life span, not the features
##Had the router lived longer, I could give it a solid 5 stars
[t] Needed to do more research
internet[@]##This product is ok but I am constantly having problems with it dropping my internet connection and causing a problem with my computer configuration for internet settings
##I researched for weeks and thought this would be great but maybe I should have looked harder and longer
[t] Look elsewhere...
##I have an older DLink router that works great, but it was time to upgrade to something faster and with more range
##The DIR-655 is faster, and range is slightly improved over my old model, but there are lots of bugs with the DIR-655
##First, it locks up frequently when navagating the setup menus
##The logs don't work, and when I check to see what is connected to the wireless it always shows nothing
##even when I have several systems using it
##I can't see my wireless printer anymore
##WEP doesn't work, but WPA seems to (unfortunately not all of systems support WPA)
##I bought another DLInk because my older model was flawless
##but the firmware in this new model is terrible
##Buyer beware
[t] Needs re-booted every other day
##When this router works it is fine
##The problem is that I have to unplug the router and let it rebootabout every other day, a real pain in the %$#
##Do not buy this item
[t] Good for about 5mo then down hill to finally dead
##I purchased this product on 2/25/11
##It worked great initially
##I upgraded from a wireless g to the n so I could get a better picture on my Roku
##It worked great
##for about 5 months, then I started having problems
##It got to the point where I had to reset the router every time I wanted to watch a show on my Roku
##After a lot of messing around, I attributed it to possible interference so I got up into my attic an ran CAT6 cable from my office to my living room in my home approx 3 wks ago
##It has been working okay since with a re-boot approx every 1-2 days on the router, then tonight it finally gave out
internet[@]##I can't get the dang thing to connect to the internet to save my life
##After messing with my computer (it took me a little while to realize it was the router that died) I finally traced the problem to the router
internet[@]##My firmware is up to date, I've re-started it 50+ times, my internet is working fine (I'm on it now thanks to my old router), I just cannot get the router to connect to the internet
internet[@]##I pulled out my old Linksys wireless g router and the internet is working fine
##Don't know what more to do that try to warranty this thing
##It is outside of my time that I can return it to Amazon (which sucks
##) so I'll see how the D-Link customer service is
##My recommendation is to stay away and try a different product
##I just cannot reccomend a product that dies like this one did
##I should have seen the signs when I started having problems with my Roku
##I don't know if it was cheaply made or what the issue is
##I'll try to get it replaced, but I still plan to buy a new router anyway because I'm sure it will take a few weeks to get this replaced under warranty
##I gave it 2 stars because it was good until it started its slow death
[t] Crapshoot
##Even though the first one would not set up at all, the second managed to work for almost FIVE months before it died
##I went to a Linksys 3200 dual-band and had even bigger problems once I FINALLY got IT working
##Linksys insists on a 192
##168
##1
##1 router setting which plays havoc with wireless Blu-ray players, wireless TVs, iPhones, etc
##So now I'm going back to the D-Link DIR-655, even though I'll have to buy a couple every year
[t] Will not entirely work with Windows 7 - Tech Support Horrible
port[@]##USB port will not work with Windows 7
##D-Link tech support is horrible
##I've been trying to get my printer set up with the usb in the router, without success
##I've now gone through five tech calls, each offering nonsense solutions, like reboot, or turn off anti virus
##On my sixth call, I spoke with someone who said he was a tech supervisor
port[@]##He said that the usb port will not work with Windows 7
##He said many other people have reported this issue, and that I should search the various support boards and listservs about this
##This router is soon to be returned
[t] Easy to set up and very good performance
##After reading the several negative reviews I was a bit reluctant but decided to give it a try
port[@][u]##I needed to  an new cable modem into my existing home network (existing phone line DSL, Netgear router gigabit cat 6 plus wireless)
##Setup was very easy
##I dont usually use the setup CD but gave it a shot and it found the new (and somewhat fussy) cable modem easily and negotiated connection without the usual entry of all the data
##I mounted it above the network wiring to give it a clear shot
##The results are very good
##Speed on full load of wired and wireless is excellent
##Easily works hand in hand with the NetGear about 3 feet away from it running different network configurations and channel allocations
##I noticed D-Link has a very noticable message on the router to remove the protective plastic sheets covering the plastic finis- could that be why some users report overheating? Anyway, wall mounted, completely cool to the touch
##My only comment is that the ethernet ports are right there next to the 3 antennae and are bound to have coupling which would distort the pattern and maybe the impedence
##I use cat6 shielded for everything so there is a lot of grounded shield nearby
##I may try the external antenna to decouple it and see if it improves performance even further
##I usually dont advocate external antennae as the tiny coax supplied with them is very lossy at microwave frequencies
##Unless it really gets it out in the clear stick with onboard antenna if you can
##I have had lots of D-link products and find them generally easy to use, and reliable
##I use their gigabit switch for the main network
##At 22Mbs down and 4 Mbs up for the wired and nearly 12Mbs measured on an ipad wireless at 40 feet through several walls and floors its a great improvement
##I am really thinking of tossing the phone DSL and just use one hookup to the D-link and cable modem
##I think its worth the price, I've paid more for some routers and gotten much less
[t] Great Wireless router once I got the settings right
##At first all of the Macs in my house were having trouble connecting to this, and when they did connect the speeds weren't very good
##Also I would have to reload the device once or twice a week
##I knew something was up though because my Android phone and a PC laptop weren't having the issue
##I played around with various settings, and finally got it right when I changed the channel width from the default setting of 20Ghz to 20-40Ghz
##Instantly my macs starting getting five bars, great speeds, no problems
##Ever since then I have not had a single issue, and have not had to reload the device once
##I would recommend the device with that caveat
##Note
[t] no more D-Link for me
##I am a long time D-Link customer(owned 3 different D-link routers), the last two all failed in one year
##When I bought the third one, I thought I can give D-link one more try, but now I regret my decision
##The router failed today(completely dead), when I need to work from home due to heavy snow! Should have bought the Linksys routers, no more D-link for me
[t] D-Link 655
price[@]##Great price and fast delivery
##Somewhat of a problem with maintainig my printers set up on the network
##After dropping ip I had to re-configure a couple of times so far
##Not a big deal buy anoying
[t] D-Link replaces Buffalo
##I ordered this router to replace my Buffalo WHR-HP-G54, which needed to be restarted 3-4 X a day after 3 months in service
##This occurred the day after the electric company installed a Smart Meter on my gas and electric service
##If I was anywhere near the gas meter with a wireless connection it locked up the network daily
##I ordered the DIR-655 from Amazon
##It was defective out of the box and looked repackaged
##I did not try setting it up for about 6 weeks after receiving it, but Amazon customer service replaced it for free as a defective return
##awesome! The second router was obviously packaged differently and was easy to set up
##PG&E; is paying for the new router to resolve the issue with the Smart Meter
##The Share Port is a joke and worked poorly for printing
software[@]##The software worked on my XP laptop but did not work with my Windows 7 Dell laptop
##The DIR-655 would not recognize my LAN printer as the Buffalo had easily done
port[@]##I had to set up my printer as a dedicated DHCP port in the router and configure my printer with DHCP disabled and give it an IP address within the router range
software[@]##I was then able to install my printer software to scan, print or fax
##That works great now
software[@]##I downloaded the MAC software on the D Link website for the crummy Share Port which installed in my wife's MAC but did not work at all
##I contacted D Link customer support and asked about the MAC to which I received no response whatsoever
##I also asked their support guys how to further secure my wireless router CNFG beyond MAC filtering, to which I got an idiotic response
##Their support was a bad experience
speed[@]##This router does not have the range of the Buffalo, but the speed through the D Link is faster than the Buffalo
##I have not dropped a connection at 2
##4 ghz with this router in 3 weeks, which kills the Buffalo
speed[@]##My download speed went up significantly with the D Link, the range is good and I am pleased with it overall
[t] Great New Router - Especially if All Your Neighbors have Wireless!
##TheD-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Routerhas all of the features that I need
##I just replaced a 5 year old wireless router with this beauty
##I bought the D-Link to ensure that I would have faster connections with my two HP laptops, a Dell laptop, my HTC Eris and my Blackberry
##I have been using the router for a couple of weeks and must admit that it is much better than my old router
##Granted, the old router was 5 years old
##However, I always want to use the best technology available
##This router works! I routinely link with over 1GPS connections on my laptops
##StrengthsIt has enough channels to handle high traffic neighborhoods
##It offers gigabit connections
##It is very easy to set up
##It uses both SPI & NAT technology to protect your intranet
##WeaknessesIt has some limitations on the firewall, but most homeowners won't notice
##For the money, the DIR-655 is an excellent choice
##Now, I don't need to restart the router to reset the channels
[t] fast and great range
##Much faster with significantly greater range than the old Microsoft wireless router this replaced
##Only complaint is that the install CD is Windows only and I had to use the web install instructions to make this work on the Mac
software[@]##Then had to go to D-Link site to get the Mac SharePort software
##Other than that, install was very smooth even for a non-techie and the usb SharePort is a nice feature
[t] Best router I've experienced in a long time.
##I know its weird to love inanimate objects, but this router has worked when nothing else would
##I've had numerous issues with Linksys, Belkin and Netgear
##I also own a dlink gig-e switchD-Link DGS-2205 5-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop Switch, which might be the greatest thing since sliced bread
##When I bought the DIR-655, I had already been reading the forums and found NOT to upgrade the firmware
##It had a huge list of known problems, including the wireless not working at all
##My experience with the Belkin had me reading forums first, not after I bought expensive gear and had problems
##A new firmware has been pushed out to fix those problems, and I have upgraded to it
##No issues yet, and its been about 30 days
##The GUI is easy to use, and you can play with it on Dlink's website before you buy
##I didn't use the install CD it came with, but used the web page at 192
##168
##0
##1
##My only complaint
[t] Good apart from the annoying SecureSpot "feature"
##Worked great until the new firmware that installs SecureSpot
##When the SecureSpot free trial finishes, they ask you to buy it and when you don't, it stops working well
##Even when you disable SecureSpot completely, it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it isn't and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized
##After 20 rounds of that over the last year I gave up and ordered a router from another company
##You may ask why not go back to the old firmware
##You can't, that "upgrade" is irreversible
##D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable
[t] Best, Much Better Than Linksys
##I have a 3,000 sf house
##I have 6 desktops (4 wireless) and 2 laptops (wireless)
##I tried the Linksys N160 router
##It didn't work for me
##I tried everything for 4 days
##I got really frustrated
##So I tried this D-Link based on all the great reviews
##I used the CD-based set up
##It was extremely easy to follow
internet[@]##I had to reset my Modem because initially the D-Link could not detect the internet
##But after reseting my modem, it worked
##Now my wired connection is 1 Gbps and my wireless-N connection is 300 Mbps!!!No issues with heat or anything
[t] Good Performance, But Reliability Issues Linger W/ Vista (possible solutions included)
##This was my first wireless router
##I've had my laptop for several months, but it wasn't until my neighbor password protected his WiFi out of the blue that I would need a router of my own
##I'd never bought a router before
##The other one I'd been using was a non-wireless dinosaur of a router that'd been given to me - but it worked so I went with it
##My standards for the new router as I saw it were
[t] Excellent router for home use and good value for money!
##I had put in a lot of research before I bought this router
##Although I am not an expert on routers, I searched for anything and everything related to routers right from people's blogs to the detailed specs from different manufacturers
speed[@]##I switched from an old D-Link DI-514 to this router and there was a huge improvement in the connectivity and speed
##The old router gave me a hard time in its last days and had issues with wireless connection getting disconnected every now and then
##I have checked wireless download and upload speeds through this router and the router has so far performed impeccably
##I have a 5 mbps connection and I never get anything less than that on the test
##My computer is not equipped with an 802
##11n device but I am eager to see what the performance would be on a computer equipped with one
##Over all it is a fantastic buy for home use and certainly worth the buck
[t] Very good Wi-Fi router
##This is the second wireless router that I have purchased, about the 8th I have worked with and I really do like it a lot
##My previous router was a Linksys, and while it performed well, I found it to be a bit buggy at times
##Even programming it with a static IP address didn't seem to remedy it's penchant for losing connectivity and requiring a re-boot
security[@]##The D-Link was very easy to configure, and security setup was a breeze
##It works great with my Windows 7 machine and so far I have not experienced an issue with connectivity (About 3 weeks)
##The unit has not gotten hot for me so far, but I do have it in an open air environment, as you should always try to do
##Speed is superior to my Linksys 54G, but that unit is a little dated as the D-Link utilizes wireless-N and the Linksys utilized wireless G protocol
##So the comparison is a bit unfair
##Appearance wise, I have to agree with one reviewer that stated the led's are very bright
##They are, but I don't use my PC in the dark, so it really isn't an issue for me
##In all, a very good router for the money, easy setup and works with WIndows 7
speed[@]##Very good speed
[t] D-link
##Really liked the product
##Very fast when it comes to downloading movies/videos
##Good reception throughout the house (2,500 sq
##ft & all walls dividing rooms are of concrete)
##Very pleased with this purchase
##Would do it all over again
[t] drops signals frequently, not reliable
##I have owned this for a couple of years
##Before this, I owned a Netgear router that was working great, until I bought new vista computers, and Netgear decided not to upgrade their firmware to be vista-compliant
##They want to force you to spend more money to buy a new one
##Of course, I decided not to buy Netgear anymore
##When I bought this, it was working fine for a while
##Then 6 months ago, it started dropping signals
##For the first few months, I didn't know it was the router
##I thought it was the DSL
##It became so bad that I switched over to cable broadband services
##And it was still dropping signals
##I digged a little deeper and found the computer that's hard wired to the router is always fine, but the other computers, iPhone, Droid, would drop the connections frequently
##Imagine how I felt after that realization
installation[@]##Cable is much more expensive than DSL, plus the installation fees
##The search is on for the next router
##Maybe I just need to buy the Apple one, they seem to be the only one that make an effort to produce a good product
[t] I like it
##It shipped on time and works great with are lap tops and computers
##Much better than our last one
[t] Terrible experience....poor connectivity
##I got this unit after doing lot of research, reading reviews, tech specs, etc on various websites including Amazon, C-Net, etc and was very excited when I got it
##My expectation was to boost the Wi-Fi connectivity in my apartment to be able to stream HD media through web and storage device (shared folders/external hard drive etc)
##Feeling very confident about my purchase based on the great feedback and reviews, I named my wireless connection as "Blazing Bytes"
##But, unfortunately it came out to be anything but "blazing"
##Rather I should have named it "Crawling Connectivity"
##Installation and set-up was very easy as I followed the supplied instructions
##However, the connectivity was very poor
##even slower than my current Belkin router from 2005
internet[@],speed[@]##To validate the connectivity issues, I checked the network speed using the internet provider's speed test link and also using speedtest
##org
##The so-called 802
##11 N effect was nowhere applicable
##(I wondered whether N stands for negligible in this new standard)My laptops are not 802
speed[@]##11 N equipped but I should be able to get as much speed as I was getting through 802
##11 a/b/g router
speed[@]##Moreover, there should not be any drop in the connection speed if I connect the LAN cable to laptop using the new router vs
##directly from modem
##Frustrated, I called the tech support and the things they asked me to do (reboot, reset, check some options in the router settings etc), I had already done in my own troubleshooting capacity
##Then they asked me guided me to upgrade the firmware
##And afetr the upgrade, re-installation, re-setup the network (a painful process)
##behold
##none of my PC/laptops could even connect to the wi-fi
##Tech support was equally helpless
##and couldn't guide me any more
##Frustrated, I hung up and decided to return the router to Amazon
[t] Garbage installer and docs
##Installer crashed twice
##Did not recognize my cable modem
##Poor user interface for configuring and weak documentation
[t] Great Item.
##I really like this item
##I am pleased that it keeps the porn off my new apple
security[@]##The cost is well worth the security for my family
##God BlessD-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
[t] Sucks for Xbox 360
##Bought this router for my Xbox 360 and so others in my house could get wireless
##While their wireless was fine I am having a pain trying to configure it with my xbox
##I have contacted customer support only to get a "well thats weird" from them
##Don't buy for a 360
[t] Did I get a lemon?
##It looks nice and sets up pretty easy, however, the one I got started giving me problems
##I have had it for a few months and now the wireless connectivity will fail to initialize
##I had a D-Link before this one and it always worked great and after several years I wanted to upgrade it
##But the DIR-655 did not work as well and now only the wired ports work, the wireless will not work longer than 60 seconds or so before it fails again
##I am very dissappointed in a product this expensive that performs so terrible
##Perhaps it is just a lemon, but since it is over 30 days it runs beyond its return policy! There goes a Benjamin Franklin that just got burned
[t] Impossible to Configure
##This router was nearly impossible to configure
##I couldn't get it to work with any of my wireless peripherals, from a Slingbox device to a wireless repeater to a powerline adaptor
##Nor could anyone I know get their laptop to join the router's wireless network
##I don't know what the problem was, but once I re-installed my old Linksys router, everything worked again
##Routers seem unnecessarily complicated to operate and configure
##They are basically the most consumer-unfriendly devices being sold
##Next I will purchase an Apple router, hopefully they've come up with an easier solution
[t] D-Link D 655
##Works great
##This is my second D-Link
##They both are worth the money
[t] Great Product!
##I've had the D-Link DIR-655 up and running my two computer network, one wired desktop and one wireless laptop, for 45 days now, with no issues what-so-ever
##It was easy to set-up and is working flawlessly with excellent range coverage
software[@]##I elected to do the easy manual set-up as opposed to the Network Magic software installation, but that's up to you
##I would definitely recommend this product
[t] Awesome product!
##My husband was the one that did the research and found out that this was the best wireless router to get
##So of course I ordered it from Amazon since I trust that if there were any problems that I wouldn't have any problems returning it
##We got the router a day earlier than we had expected so we decided to install everything that night
##I was nervous thinking it would take hours to set up
##It took us 25 minutes! Not kidding! It was so easy to install and we were online with our new laptop in 30 minutes! The CD that came with the router was so helpful with installing the router
speed[@]##This is a must buy! The speed of getting online and viewing pages are just awsome
[t] Excellent range but keeps dropping wireless connection.
##Overall, the DIR-655 has a much better wireless range than my old DI-634M but the DIR-655 keeps dropping my wireless connection after about 5 mins for about 2 to 5 seconds
##I researched the net and tried every tip I could find but was only able to get it to keep a connection for at most 30 mins
##I don't have any interference and live on a 2 acre plot
##Since I use the slingbox on my laptop a lot, the disconnects were unacceptable to me
##I eventually had to return the DIR-655 back to Amazon and I have just received the TrendNet TEW-633GR instead
##This model is almost identical to the DIR-655 and so far after 2 hours, I have not had a connection drop with the TEW-633
##I'll update if I notice any changes
[t] Works Great
##I regret trying the "Easy setup" wizards
##Once I went the manual route, things went smoothly
##I wasted at least an hour trying to do it the "recommended" way
##Since then, it's been operating very well
speed[@]##I use VOIP and WebEx and high speed cable
##This unit outperforms my previous router, which was about 8 years old
[t] Very pleased thus far
port[@]##Chose this product over an Airport Extreme due to the extra hard-wire port plus got it for about $50 cheaper
##(and I'm an Apple diehard)
##Set up was a snap
##Connecting 2 eeePC's, 1 Wii, and 1 MacBookPro wirelessly
##Hardwire connections to a Dell desktop and a Mac G5
##It's been hit pretty heavy by everyone for the entire day and I haven't encountered the heat issue that some have mentioned
##This replaces a previous D-Link router (which I'll keep just in case for a backup)
##Would heartily recommend this product to others
[t] router
##This unit replaced a Netopia wireless modem
##This unit is faster and has greater wireless capacity ( range- distance )
[t] lasted for about a week
##The DIR-655 was easy to intall, but the wireless portion of the router died a week later
##Tech support recommended that it be returned and gave me a case number
[t] dLINK ROUTER
##Although my old D-Link router was just one year old and seemingly not working well, I decided to try another D-Link, the DIR-655
##It set up easily and got my system(wired and wireless) working really well
##The little blue lights are not annoying and if they were I could turn the router so that I wouldn't see them
##I definitely would stick with D-Link because I found their support also helpful
##HLJR
[t] DLDIR655
##As the previous products of D-link very easy to install/connect
##Excellent range of response for the wireless part
port[@][u]##The only down side is that the share USB  does not work; the same happened in the previous model
##Technical support assistant from D-Link people and/or web site poor to non existant
##I have contact them through e-mail 3 times they haven't even bother to response or acknoledge my inquire
[t] D-Link Rocks
##I had a problem setting it up but I called the help line and they had me up and running in no time
##Great service
[t] Great router
##I'm new to the whole wireless router world and decided to take the plunge
##After doing extensive research and getting a lot of advice from my tecchie friends, I decided to purchase the DIR 655
##Although I'm somewhat of a tecchie myself, the wireless router world was new to me, so I was a little nervous about getting the right router that would work in all my rooms
price[@]##After getting the best price around on Amazon, I received it a few days later
##Setup was a breeze! I was up and running in no time and hooked up all my wireless gadgets easily
##I had an issue setting up the encryption properly, so I called the help desk
##My experience with them was fine
##The guy who helped me sounded a little high strung, but certainly, I understood his instructions and was all sorted out within a few minutes
##For those that say setup is really complicated, it's actually not
##It does take a little effort in terms of getting the encryption setup correctly if you're not wireless router savvy, but the helpdesk was helpful and only took a few minutes
##All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase
##I've only gotten a couple of quick dropouts which corrected within a second or two and have had no issues over the last month
##And it works beautifully with my Netflix Roku box in my living room
streaming[@][u]##No issues at all when  movies
##After all my research, I'm glad I chose this wireless router
[t] Easy to install, easy to customize
##Totally recommend this item
##I have installed netgear and belkins in the past, for friends and family, and this D-link router is just as easy as any other
##Following the quickstart instructions is just enough
##I personally purchased this router because it had the shareport USB utility which allowed me to connect a USB external hard drive, that I can access anywhere from home, and it works fine
##The only downside is that the hard drive is only accessible from one laptop at a time, which is fine for me at this moment
##I hope D-link will improve this in the future
##I live in a 1600 ft2 apartment and the signal is strong all the way to the last corner, at least 3 bars (out of 5)
antennas[@]##Make sure you follow the recommendations for the antennas and how to arrange them
##It really makes a difference
##Setting up a WEP-encrypted password is easier than other routers I had to work with
##In conclusion this is a great product and I totally recommend it
[t] good performance but vista issues
speed[@]##the speed is good but vista doesn't seem to like it even tho it says it "works with vista" on a logo
##keeps dropping the connection and have to reboot to fix it but thats the experience with two toshiba's i tried
##the dell laptop seems to have been ok with it but i haven't used it much so not sure
[t] Great value and Easy install
##I can hardly believe what a deal this is
price[@]##Excellent capability and price
installation[@]##The installation was easy and the performance flawless
##Highly recommend
[t] Works like a Charm
##I bought this about a month ago
##Works great with both windows and mac computers
##It is speedy and reliable
##It is definitely worth the money
[t] Promise not met
##This is the second one of this specific item (D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router) we've ordered that we've not been able to get to work with our system
##Neither my son nor I could get either of the first or second one that we ordered to connect with our DSL after multiple attempts with both
##Our previous router is DLink and I've been a fan of the brand, but this version didn't work for us
[t] Think "outside and inside" the box
##Great router except for the asthetics
##For those of you that love this router but are bothered by the bright blue LED's, here's a quick 10 minute fix
##The white plastic top of the router is held in place by two small screws located underneath the rubber feet on the bottom rear of the router
##Remove these screws and dab one drop of red finger nail polish on the top half of each LED
##Replace the top and screws, and voila, the LED's are still blue, but only half as bright as before
##If you have always wished DLink would offer this model in black and you are willing to invest another 10 minutes, now's the time to have it your way
##While the top is off spray it with Black Satin paint that is made for plastic
##Mask the LED light bar that seperates the top from the bottom with tape, and spray the remaining white of the botton case that shows
##I didn't worry about doing the full bottom of the case since it is not visable
##You now have one of the best, cost effective, routers available, with unobtrusive indicator LED's, and it doesn't look like an Apple TV!
[t] D-Link Wireless Router -- fantastic.
##The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router product I got a couple of weeks ago works fantastically well
speed[@]##Installation was a breeze, and the speed is noticeably faster than the previous wireless router it replaces (the older one "broke")
##No glitches whatsoever
##What else can I say? I am smiling
[t] Very impressive range
##I recently moved into an office without on-site Internet access
##I had to walk over the another building (about 200 feet away) to use the local network
##I was thinking about setting up a wireless bridge to extend the wifi signal to my office building
##But thanks to the DIR-655 and its extended range, I don't need to
##To my surprise, my laptop detected a wireless signal and could connect near my window
##I set up a D-Link range extender in that window, the office now has wifi coverage
speed[@]##I'm getting throughput equal to about 80% of the company's T1 line speed
##The DIR-655 is in another building, over 200 feet away, in a closed cabinet away from windows! The range of this router eliminated the need for additional hardware
##Edit
[t] Satisfied customer
##This was my first time setting up a wireless network and the D-link Dir 655 Estreme N Wireless Router was easy to setup
##It is working fine and the signal strength is very strong in my house
##I am using three (3) computers with this network
##It is not cheap, but I would recommend it for the overall proformance to value ratio
[t] Bad product no support incompetent technology
##Dlink DIR655 extreme N router doesn't work as advertised
##Tech supportis uninformed, naive, and unfamiliar with technology
##DMZ doesn't work
##Firewall is undefeatable
##Packets on DMZ placed IP node are filtered
##UDMP multicasting discovery protocols will not work properly on the LAN,even with routers multicasting switches enabled
##I'm suspecting that theBelkin product may be a better bet
##It's fast, but tech support on this product is about on the level of Linksys
##which is to say
##Godawful
##K
[t] Very Disappointing
##I bought this product yesterday and it was supposed to install in 10 minutes but it took over three hours calling the tech support and talking with someone who could hardly speak English!
##I am very dissatisfied with this product because instead of automatically being installed I had to change all the IP Address, Sub Net etc manually
##I think a $20 router would do better
##I also had an older version of D-Link that stopped working within 6 months
##So I am all done with D-Link and would never even look at their products
[t] D-LINK Xtreme versus NETGEAR RangeMax
##A low tech guy's comparison of two high tech wireless routers
##***********************************************No dropouts on either router
##If you're getting dropouts, you or your neighbor may have a 2
##4 Ghz cordless phone or a microwave oven thats interferring with the router's signal

[t] Extremly bad UI
##My first router back in 2003 was D-Link and I hated and again 7 years later I'm hating it still
##it seems like the whole UI is speaking foreign language to me
##I tried to set up for 3 days and couldn't get it to work properly (schedules, USB HD, PRinter
##), so it went back
##If you could speak D-Link language, it seem like it's capable of lots of neat things, but I don't have time
##Now I got myself Netgear N300 and finished setting up within couple of hours
[t] Couldn't setup, need new firmware update
##I recently purchased this item due to great reviews in Amazon and a recommendation from a tech friend
##The end result was a return of this item
##Why? First, the ease of setup is not so easy at all
##Yes, the setup dvd disk should take me to wireless freedom in no time (but its not compatible with a Mac), in my case I have a PC (I did try) and a Mac Laptop
##Anyways, I called their tech support, which after 2 calls and 45 mins later, they diagnosed it as "need firmware update"
##Great, this issue should be fixed in no time, however, the tech support never send me the firmware update file
##After waiting for 2 days I called again, spoke with another support guy
##"Yes, I'll send you the firmware update to your email account," said he
##I waited for two more days
##No firmware, I did check my junk folder and no emails from D-link
##That was it, I return this router back to Amazon the next day
##I am afraid this particular item either needs a necessary firmware, which maybe an excuse from DLink or simply it is a defective router sold by this retail company
##I hope my bad experience helped you
##Cheers! Oscar
[t] Are you kidding
##This router is a joke
##The firmware ruined it
##do the research
##learn the facts
##I got screwed
##don't get screwed as well
[t] Duped by Amazon
##Amazon sends out older version of the hardware
##It's v4 now, but Amazon sends out v3
##I guess Amazon becomese a surplus dumping ground
[t] works just as it should
##I can't help but laugh every time i read a review of a tech product by someone that has no business trying to do what they are trying to do
##This is, for all intents and purposes, a router! with all of the big boy features that a router should have, BUT yes, in a consumer product, and Amazon will and does sell it to anyone with the cashe to purchase it
##Unfortunately there is no aptitude test to keep most of you from buying it
##So, "caveat emptor" but NOT because this is a bad - or even potentially bad - product, but because it does a lot of stuff that the average joe blow computer user hasn't a clue how to use or why
##I cannot comment on the dlink customer support, but can only imagine it is probably as bad as all the complainers have said, maybe worse
##again, you are talking about a piece of technology that companies offer full blown college courses and credentials to learn how to configure properly, and trying to explain these concepts over the phone to an obliviate can be somewhat taxing if not impossible
##and yes, i can see where a support person would just eventually get fed up with you
##in dlink's defense, they have tried - best they can - to develop a "plug and play" solution to get this configured for you
##but here is the bottom line for those that have written something like "it works with Vista!" or some other such moronic thing
##a router doth not care what operating system you have, and you doth not need to install ANYTHING on your computer to make this thing work! it's a router!, it simply routes packets from point a to point b
##if your computer isn't configured properly, you may have problems, but don't blame the router
##it's more than likely doing EXACTLY what you told it to do!that said - [stepping down off the milk crate] - i bought this router because i was thoroughly pissed off at linksys/cisco for making a competing product that truly does NOT work, but that is a different story
##once i got this router, i have NEVER had a bad thing to say about it
##i run anywhere from 4 to 7 computers through it, both wired and wireless, running Vista 32 and 64, XP, Windows 2003 server, Linux, open BSD and yes, even a flippin' Mac on rare occasions when i really need a hair-cut and i simply don't have the time, so I figure I'll just pull my hair out one strand at a time for a few hours while struggling to find the right mouse button
##Anyway, this thing is rock solid, has great wireless range, and is easy to configure (when you know what you are doing, or at least have some technical aptitude
security[@],port[@]##) I won't say you must be a tech geek, but SOME aptitude will greatly help you during your travels through wireless security options, port forwarding, and firewall settings
##This or any other product like it, simply isn't made to be "plug and play" those that have given this anything less that 4 stars either got a bad one - not out of the realm of possibility - or simply have no business trying to do this themselves
##This is a prefect opportunity to hire the geek squad if you don't know what you are doing, but don't blame the product if you have trouble
##In the immortal words from the movie, Mr
##Mom, "You're doing it wrong

[t] Misleading Info on Box.
##The box states that this router has 1 usb 2
port[@]##0 port
port[@]##What they don't say on the box is that the function of this port has been limited by them only to the use a flash drive to install network settings
##I would think if you state you have a usb 2
port[@]##0 port then you should be able to connect to another device with a simular port as per the specifications outlined for this type of port
##What would you think of a car that advertised it had an automatic transmission only to find out after you bought it that the automatic part was only from first to second gear? The only thing extreme about this router is the amount of B
##S
##that d-link expects us to lap up
[t] Did not work!
##Bought it and it did not work right!! Keeps doing a DNS error that never happens with my other router! This is junk! Don't Buy!
[t] Serious frequent connection droping problems
##I bought this router to replace my Actiontec router
##Actiontec router supports only wifi g type connections but is very stable
speed[@]##To improve the speed I bought Dlink DIR-655 router about a month ago and since then I am having very frequent connection droping problems
##I have tried almost every option and configuration suggested but this problem seems to be in the basic design of this product
##This router is fast but only when it works
##I am going back to my old Actiontec router
[t] Best router we have ever purchased!!
##The D-Link DIR 655 is the best router we have tried! It replaces a Belkin Pre-N wireless router that had frequent signal loss
##Installation on the DIR 655 was so easy, I was amazed
software[@][u]##We followed the directions exactly and had the easiest set-up ever! The included  Network Magic is working like a charm
##One computer is running Windows XP, the other Windows Vista
installation[@]##There were no installation issues at all
##File sharing, printer sharing, all set up quickly
##Internet speeds on the laptop are noticeably faster -- and we are using the built in network adapter on the laptop (a Dell Inspiron 1720)
##We aren't even running the Extreme N Notebook adapter
installation[@]##We owned the DIR 655 for over a month before we installed it, dreading the possible problems normally associated with networking and installation of new hardware
##Now we wish we had installed it immediately!!
[t] Not backwards compatible with some G platforms
##The N wireless function did install and work very well on my Vista Unltimate laptop, and wife's Vista Home Premium
##Would not work with our Lexmark X9350
##Nor backwards compatible
##Sfter spending hours on phone with support from Lexmark and D-Link, comfirmed not compatible
##Returned back to Amazona for a effortless refund
##That's why I will continue to make purchases from Amazon
##com
[t] Total solution for any home or small business
##This Router does it all
antennas[@]##All 4 wireless bands, 3 powerful antennas covers the house
##All 3 detach so that the 10db Antennas can be used for a wider coverage area or areas
##No matter the cost, this one does it all!
[t] Installation can be tough, but it works perfectly
security[@]##Don't be frustrated if the router and its security settings are difficult or confusing to configure
##If you stick with with it, this Wireless N router works phenomenally
speed[@]##I get amazing speed and signal in every corner of my house
##Two troubleshooting tips
[t] Incredible Performance, Simple Setup
##I've had this for about 3 months now and I've been astounded by the performance and range of this wireless router
speed[@][u]##Having a compatible N series receiver makes a big difference, but even with b & g, the  has been really, really impressive
[t] Dang Good Router
##I've been using this for about a month now
##No problms at all
##Easy to set up
##My wireless computers (all G) get just as fast of a connection wired or wireless (based on speedtests, using 10MB Roadrunner)
##I don't have any N devices to test so I can't comment on those
##I never expected it to work this well
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##I purchased this router after my Netgear Router WNR854T that was less than 12 months old stopped working and all I got was the dreaded green light
##I decided to review routers before I settled on a new purchase
installation[@][u]##The D-Link DIR-655 was rated very well for use and ease of 
##So far I haven't been disappointed
##It installed very easily and works fine since I purchased it 2 months ago
##It came with a trial copy of Network Magic and that allowed me to set up other computers in my house very easily and secure them
##That alone was worth alot to me
##I would highly recommend this router to anyone looking to purchase one
price[@]##The price was reasonable and I received it very quickly
[t] overall solid performer except problem brought by ZoneAlarm
installation[@]##The experience so far is positive although there is a major episode during the initial installation which almost led me to return this product, thinking it may be defective
##This episode eventually turned out not to be this router's fault, but something else, which I'd detail below
##You may find it useful as well if you have similar problem
software[@]##I used the software CD which comes with the router to setup first
##Everything worked fine until the last step
##It fails to verify connectivity
##I double checked every setting on router and my DSL modem
##I repeated the process
##Same issue at end
##I got bit frustrated
##But I did not give up and started to use its Web based configuration which provides a lot more flexibility
##But it did not turn out to be very successful as well
##I tried various setting on router and the DSL modem, including standard dhcp mode and PPPoE mode
##They only worked sometimes
##The next morning things started falling apart and I could not connect anywhere
##This finally drove me nuts
##After almost a week of frustration, I finally figured out the DNS is the culprit here
##I can always connect to Internet using ip address, but if I used hostname, it could not resolve the hostname (always hangs)
##Now I have narrowed down the issue, but I had no clue why DNS would fail
##I tried even to put DNS server setting directly on my Windows setup (overriding default ones) and it has limited success
##Connection is still sporadic
##And I may have to reboot router/modem/Windows from time to time
security[@][u],software[@]##Before I thought this product is c**p and decided to return it, I had a last try to remove any  software on my Windows
##After I removed ZoneAlarm, things finally start working seemlessly! Yeah, ZoneAlarm is the culprit here which causes DNS resolution to fail
##Why it does so? I don't know
##But without ZoneAlarm, things work perfectly
##I hope ZoneAlarm can fix their problems in the future since it is a major hassle (considering how many people may use the similar setups)
##All in all, I am happy with the product now
speed[@]##It is reliable (I have not rebooted it since then) and connection speed is fine (up to max DSL speed)
[t] C.
##I concur with other reviews that this router is a solid performer
##So far it produces a faster rate than the Xtreme N router - I own both
[t] Great product, but you may need some experience to install
##Very please with this product
##Provides plenty of configuration options and independent access control for each computer on the network
internet[@],software[@],installation[@]##Be aware that the installation software assumes that you currently have a PC connected directly to the internet and not via a router of proxy server
internet[@]##If you already have a router or proxy, you will need to have some basic knowledge of how your system works and connects to the internet so that you can manually configure your new router
##Once set-up, it works great
[t] Mmmpgh...
##My first experience with home networking or Wi-Fi
##So I thought I'd get a top-o-za-line unit
##Worked immediately with my XP machine and continues to work flawlessly there, but not my gf's Vista box
##She's gone through weeks of trying different drivers, blue-screen crashes,
##ugh! Also, on a good day my work laptop works fine, on others I'll lose Internet for no apparent reason every hour or so
##Don't know what's to blame for that
##Wireless signal is VERY strong - just stops accessing the outside world
##I have not attempted to contact the manufacturer
[t] Excellent router
##The D-Link DIR-655 router is great
##I've had it for over a month so far and I haven't had to touch it or do anything to it at all
##It has had no problems
internet[@]##Since setting it up my internet connection has been much faster than with my previous router (Netgear) which was a G connection (and noticeably slower) and frequently stopped working
##I highly recommend this
[t] Solid router
##This is a very solid router
##It was reasonably easy to set up and has been a solid performer
##The reason for only 4 stars is the administrative interface
##It is somewhat jumbled and it is not always clear where you need to go for some of the settings
##Netgear is much better on this front as far as I'm concerned, but this D-Link has been a lot more reliable than the Netgear offerings
[t] I love this Router
##I bought this router to replace a Linksys WRT300N and I must say this router blows it away
##Not only is it smaller and better looking, it provides a much longer range and fewer dropped connections (as of this review, none)
##I've been using it for about two months now and use it in mixed G/N mode without any problems
##It works perfectly with a wired desktop, 2 wireless desktops, 2 wireless laptops, a wireless PlayStation 3, a wireless Xbox 360 and a wireless Wii
##I have not had any problems with heat or interference
##I would definitely recommend this router
[t] D-Linkk 655 Extreme N
##This product has expanded the functionability of my laptop I now have the freedom to move within the house and around the area with receiption
[t] Love this router!
##I was using a linksys router before and I had so much trouble with it from day one
##Now since I got this new router it is amazing
internet[@]##My internet connection is faster than ever and I have no interuptions
##Also my laptop is usually connected before my computer is done booting all programs
##It is stylish and sits great on top of the desk
##The setup was incredibly easy and I was online in 15 minutes
##Great router and I reccomend it to anyone
[t] good router
##The router so far is working good
##We had some trouble with the set up,had to call for tech advice
##But once that hurdle was passed it works fine
##Just wish it wasn't white
[t] Great Simple inexpensive fast router
##Very simple wireless router to set up
price[@]##Good sale price even better with Amazon coupons
##Works very well
software[@]##Like the netgear software to manage computers on the network and easy to monitor kids activities
##Good range throughout our house
##Options to encrypt the network to prevent unauthorized use
##5 stars!! Would Definitely purchase again given a choice
##I researched many different routers for about 2 months before making this purchase
[t] Great for Mac users!
##This router is Excellent for Mac users
##Works like a dream
installation[@]##easy set up and installation
[t] Worthless router; waste of money!
##I purchased the DIR-655 thinking it would be an upgrade from the DIR-615
##I had been using the 615 for something like 2 years and it worked flawlessly
##The main reason I was upgrading was to extend my wireless range
##While the 655 is just as easy to set up as the 615 (the interface if virtually identical), the 655 has never worked correctly
speed[@]##While is consistently measured my download speed at 10-11Mbps on the 615, I never had a test higher than 3Mbps with the 655
##Everything takes much longer to load and I receive time-out errors many times when trying to watch video
security[@]##Perhaps the worst issue is the 655 seems like it may have created some kind of security issues with my on-line banking
##Immediately after installing the router, I started having issues with not being able to log-in to my on-line banking, then the site would say it didn't recognize me
security[@]##Rather than asking the typical challenge questions, I was being asked to provide all of my personal info (name, ssn, dob, ATM card number, ATM pin, ATM security code, DL number, and so forth)
##While I can not say with 100% certainty that this is tied to the router, I know it happened immediately after the router was installed
##I will say this
[t] Great when it works, but not reliable at all (even with firmware updates)
##Pros (they don't outweigh the cons, but here they are)
[t] dlink dir-655
##I am very satisfied with the router as far as signal strength and ease of use
##The only draw back I see is having to reset it every 2-3 days,aside from that I find it a solid router
[t] Great Product!
##This router is very user friendly
##If you know how to read and follow directions
##the setting up of this wireless router will be a breeze! It took less than ten minutes
##You don't need to be an IT Guru for this product
##I will update my post in a month or so; I believe this product is going to be very reliable
##Great quality product!
[t] Works great.
##Item installed easy
##Worked right away will all my componants
##Works on both floors will great connectivity
##I would recomend
[t] D-link dir-655 wireless router
software[@]##Works well and software and instructions made it easy to set up
##I'm not sure if signal is better or worst than any other, but this is working very well at my house
[t] Definitely one to get
##I haven't yet explored the dual-band routers
##but, i used a variety of Wireless-N routers
##I have a Netgear and a TP-Link along with this
##Out of all, I would definitely part with Netgear Rangemax
##My experience with a few of them has been that they are difficult to setup and maintain and have intermittent issues
##TP-Link has been great, but is limited to 150MBps
##That leaves this router to shine
##Goods
[t] I'm Pleased
##An I
##T
##professional recommended this wireless router
##It works great and it was easy to get it up and running
##I live in an apartment and I have no trouble keeping a wireless connection between rooms
internet[@],speed[@]##This router works very well, but keep in mind you must have a good internet speed
##I recommend this product
##It even comes with a small black stand so the router can stand vertically
##(Takes up less space!)
[t] Works great until someone turns on that microwave oven
##Works pretty good until you or your neighbor get that microwave oven going, then signal's gone even if the router is within 10 feet from you
##I would've expected N bandwidth to work better than that
[t] Was Hoping for No Dropped Connections - Success!
##Been using it for about two weeks now
##In the first week, I had to restart the router 3 times
##I replaced my Belkin G hoping to alleviate the dropped connection issue
##UPDATE
[t] Amazing Router!!
##Great router!It replaces my old netgear router which was absolutely horrible since the day i bought it
##It would constantly crash on me on a daily basis and choke badly under heavy use *(gaming)With the D-link, its been more than a week and i've yet to reset it
##Speeds have almost doubled and the signal strength has increased drastically
##To add, i have this router sitting under my tv right next to my cordless phone
[t] Wireless drops several times daily.
##No improvement in range over my old router
##While router has to be reset several times a day for wireless to connect
##I have tried all the fixes suggested by the D-Link forums to help with the problem and nothing has helped
##I have given up and have ordered a Cisco-Linksys router
[t] No improvement over 5 year old Linksys router
##I bought this in an attempt to increase the wifi range of my router
##I recently moved my modem location to the far end of my home, and my old Linksys b/g router couldn't throw a signal to the other end of the house
##I figured a brand new "n" router would do the trick
##Note I also upgraded my cable modem to something top of the line
##While I have no complaints about setup or the ability to connect, the signal strength is not one bit better than my old router
##Not sure why it advertises "6 times the range!"If you need a router, sure, but if you are trying to upgrade, don't waste your money
[t] GREAT! Worth every penny!
##This router was so much better then my previous Linksys router! My previous router kept on disconnecting because of my intensive gaming and it was a irritant to me! But when I received this router, it was perfect for me to play Battlefield 3 on my PS3 while my siblings use the computer! No disconnection and pure smooth gaming! No lag or what nonsense! Great for gamers and pc users alike! The performance of it is superb and I really recommend this for everyone! From gamers to just normal browsing of the internet! Great product! 5 STARS!
[t] One Fast Motha'
speed[@][u]##Works great! It's so nice to finally have wireless n connectivity with high  cable internet! My roommate and I use several wireless devices at one time with no  issues
##I have a small place so the connection doesn't have to reach too far
##I installed it on my hallway wall towards the ceiling for a great central location! I'd recommend it
[t] guest router
security[@]##Solved a real problem of security with this router and made my office staff happy at the same time
##Will use this company again
[t] Great router
##I have been using the router for a month
##Works great for my 1000 sq ft apartment
##The signal strength is good all throughout apartment
##I had to restart it once after 20 days other than that it has been pretty good
[t] Good router
##This router has a lot of features and configuration options
##If you want to get the maximum of it you need to have a wireless card with the same technology, set it to use only wireless N, put it in a good location and play with it's configurations (Transmission Rate and channel)
##With some transmission rates you will get more speed, but you range of action will be shorter and vice versa
##I can watch HD videos (720p) smoothly, but do not expect to stream fullhd with it
##For that you really need the old and good cable
[t] Great value and speed doubled!
speed[@]##When installed in place of my Trendnet, speed went from 10 to 15 mps to 30 to 35 mps
##Well worth the cost of the upgrade
##Next to upgrade is provider supplied Surfboard modem
[t] Good Product
##I've been very pleased with this router
##I set up my wifi on it about 3 months ago and it's been going strong ever since
##It remains at around 54 mbs and streams well to my T-mobile G2X
##It works good to my TV downstairs as I have the unit in my office upstairs
##I would recommend this product to anyone
[t] Great Little Router
##This is really great value for your money
##As many have stated, wireless routers vary greatly in their performance from home to home; whether due to house layout, geographic location, or what have you
##I can tell you that we have a small one bedroom house in the hills of Los Angeles
##With that in mind, the signal is always full and NEVER cuts out; including in our garden and patio
security[@]##The security options are top notch and the the physical aesthetics of the router itself are quite pleasing
##(Someone described it as bulky, they must have been trying to fit it into a mouse hole)
##The only performance drawback is the lack of dual band signals, but for most people this is hardly a setback
streaming[@]##I've never had problems or lag of any sort with video streaming (including netflix streaming) or game playing
##Admittedly I went from an ISP provided router which cut out every 20 min, so this router naturally seems god-sent in comparison
price[@]##But it truly is a great router for the price
##Would highly recommend to anyone who just wants a quality router that will not lose its signal
##Note
[t] Excelente Router
##tengo este router al final de mi casa, conecto 2 blackberrys, 2 laptops y un playstation 3, la se&ntilde;al llega perfecto, el playstation 3 esta al otro extremo de la casa y la se&ntilde;al llega en un 80% 75% promedio, me parece excelente!Se&ntilde;al
[t] Value! Power! Signal!
##I recently purchased this router, and man am I impressed
##I had a Wireless G Router and it had bad reception on the bottom floor of my 3 story townhouse
##This router has excellent signal strength to any part of my home, and the speeds are stable
##The one little bit of criticism I have is that when using the CD, my computer would not recognize the router
##If that happens to you just type in 192
##168
##0
##1 in your web browser when you have it connected correctly and do the manual setup
##Definitely would recommend this to anyone who has a large home, multiple stories, or is an avid gamer as the QOS engine helps keep signals stable
##Best value and quality when it comes to a wireless router
[t] Best router I have owned. Period.
##This is a great router
##Previously owned a Belkin router and seemingly we had to reset the router several times a week
##This router keeps chugging along with no problems, even after the power went out one time
[t] great device
##I am not tech savvy but this router was easy to set up
##My 10" netbook, kindle and 7" tablet "read" this new router easily
##My 2 10" tablets did not
##I finally decided to call tech support before sending the unit back and am I happy I did
##My tech person, Jennifer, was extremely helpful and had all my devices up and running in just a matter of minutes
##Not sure yet how strong this router is or if I will get reception on my front deck
##Do not know the range for it as yet but am hoping that I will be getting better reception than I did from my old Belkin "g" router
##Will update when necessary
##Also, in reference to those who indicated that this router becomes very hot
##I have not found this to be true and I do not use the included stand
##Perhaps they did not receive the stand or did not try using it??Update
[t] Awesome Router with Long Range
##To start off I bought this item because of the previous reviews I read about it
##I have a 3500 square foot two-story house and I owned a Netgear Dual Band N router but was getting really bad reception upstairs
##The best I ever got was like 50% signal strength with the average being around 25-30%
##Once I installed this router I can get a full signal strength almost anywhere in the house to include all the room upstairs
##This router is setup right outside the den office near the front of the house
##The setup instructions was straight forward but it did take a while for my modem to synchronize and recognize it, but once it did it has been working like a charm
##Ignore all the bad press this unit has, as you can never please everyone all the time
##It is like anything else, there will be some bad apples in the bunch
##I am happy with this item and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it due to its range capabilities!!!
[t] Have had for several years - 5-star
##I have had this model for several years
##It has worked fabulously! I was scrolling through the 100 sellers in electronics and saw 'my' wireless router
##I concur it's functionality and quality is as good as it sales rating
[t] Poor quality control
##I got this router to replace my linksys that just keeled over
##I hadn't had very much with the linksys so I decided to try a different brand
##The first one I received would not power on and I had to return it (no issues there - Amazon made it super easy to return
antennas[@][u]##) The second one powered on with no problem but one of the connectors for the  is broken
##I can't wait another week for the return process so I'm just using it as-is
##It seems to work ok, but I would not recommend it due to these quality control issues
[t] Eaaasssyyyyy & fast!
##I had a Linksys G Wireless router which came with my Tmobile land line
##The land line was cut off about 6 months ago, but I kept using the router
speed[@]##My average speed used to be between 3-5 mbps
##Found this router on amazon and ordered it
speed[@]##Setup was literally 15 mins or less maybe and now the speed is between 20-25 mbps
speed[@][u]##5x increase in 
##Now i'm wondering why I did not order this earlier
[t] 2 XBox 360s, 1 PC runs fast
##I'm very pleased that when I play Call of Duty Black Ops my NAT type is open on both XBoxes! and I work from home my PC can't be faster
##If you're a gamer and can't afford Dual-Band look no further this is the one
[t] It's OK
##I bought this router when I switched from Verizon DSL to Comcast (20/Mbps)
##Had everything set-up and running in less than 15 minutes
##Speedtest'ed the wired connection @ 23+Mbps, my room about 50ft away @ 14+Mbps
##One drawback of this router was trying to get the SharePort to work with my USB printer
##I spent many fruitless hours lurking on DLink forums
##tried two external hard-drives to no avail
##I had this router for about 3 months and was fairly pleased with it, when we had a intense thunder storm
##it was bricked on the spot
##Stagnely enough the other devices plugged into the same surge protector held up fine(including the cable modem)
##I ended up returning this and buying ASUS (RT-N16) instead and i couldn't be happier
##it has two USB ports which instantly recognized my devices
##full-featured web GUI makes set-up a breeze
##just make sure to upgrade to the latest firmware
speed[@]##Range and speed are the same if not a little better than the DIR-655
internet[@]##Also if your considering upgrading from a G Network to an N Network i would say the difference is negligible unless you have a fast internet connection
##I was getting speeds of 3Mbps in my room where as now i'm getting 14+
[t] Good 'Ol Reliable - I have 2
##OK, I've skimmed the 2000ish reviews on this N300 router and short story - just BUY IT
##Long story
[t] Worst Home Or Business Router Ever
##I got this router to replace one by another brand, because this was said to be the best for gaming or small business routers
internet[@],streaming[@]##I tried it out at home, and even doing regular things, such as streaming video or surfing the internet would cause the router to drop connections
##The router also tries to manage network with it's QOS system that completely fails, and it ends up making it much worse
##The router will try and assess the network's connection speed, leaving the router to just be out for 5 minutes or so for a single disconnect
##I tried using this exact same router to manage a small business network, and it would do the exact same thing
##The router would lose connection for 1 second and be down for 5 minutes and then do the same thing over and over all day long
##I tried to change every setting there was
##I turned off the QOS system, I turned off the router firewalls, I looked at all the troubleshooting pages, and nothing helped
##IF you are considering to buy it, search for troubleshooting data for the router and the amount of information that is out there on the net should lead you to not buy it
##I got a Netgear router, plugged it in, and it just worked
##Pros
[t] Headed for the Trash
##I bought this unit in Nov '11 to replace a Netgear WRG614, which up until then, had been performing yeoman-like service
##You see I had bought a Samsung Blu-ray player and I wanted to hook it up to Hulu and some other video download sites
antennas[@][u]##I thought it the Netgear was a bit slow and I needed a faster unit and the D-Link with its 3  looked promising
##Well it's been nothing but a problem
##It doesn't seem to reach as far in my home as the Netgear
internet[@]##Every time I fire the Blu-ray player up it has forgotten how to locate the internet
##The instructions are confusing & I'm tired of having Samsung, D-Liink and my ISP all point their finger at the other guys
##Who needs it
##It's trash
[t] High Tech Garbage
##This appeared to be a great router at first
##It works very well, when it works that is
##Tons of people have disconnecting problems with this router and the only fix online and in the many tech forums to fix these problems is to just buy a different router than this one
##Unless you enjoy continuously dropping connection from your router
##I've heard that the firmware may be the problem so if you do end up buying this you better not update the firmware because once you do you cannot go back to the older version
##I disconnected mine and hooked up my old router that I originally bought this thing to replace
##Bad router and bad customer support from manufacturer
[t] Not worth it for the price.
##I bought this to replace my $40 Belkin after it crapped out on me
##When I got it I attempted to install it using the driver it came with
##And of course, it didn't work
##So I had to call up D-link and after about 30mins or so got it working
##The customer service was nice, and I'm not complaining, but there's no reason I should have to call them to get the thing working
##I get off the phone and don't even bother checking the Wifi which was a mistake
software[@]##I was getting about 26Mbps! I couldn't even download updates for my anti-virus software
##Even my labtops which have great built in wireless cards were getting low Mbps
##I was getting 54Mpbs+ with my Belkin, and I have to be right next to the D-Link to get that
##The only reason why I give it 2 stars is because I paid $30 and not $70 for it
[t] Works great, super fast.
##Strong signal, does get a little warm, just keep it elevated and everything is fine
##I've had this router for over two years now and it has worked flawlessly
[t] Replaced an older router
##This is a great product
##I called Century Link first to make sure it was comatible with their modem, and their tech staff recommended D-Link
internet[@]##Since we installed it our internet has not bogged down or froze up even once
##With our old one, we were re-booting it once per week
##We have our Actntec Modem full and 3 units plugged into the D-Link 655
##Never thought it could be this easy
[t] Good Product
##After reading the reviews I was a little hesitant in ordering this product, but it works great!!! I have gone from a Belkin (which my iPhone will never automatically pick up) to this unit
streaming[@]##Great range, I have 4 iPhones and an Ipad and they always choose my signal first (unlike with the belkin) I also have 2 Google boxes and I'm very pleased with the HD streaming
##The lites are bright, but I don't sleep in my office and the unit does NOT overheat
[t] Flawless and Fast
##I bought this router in conjunction with a DLINK 520B ADSL Modem
##My older configuration used an older Zyxel 660 gateway and my ISP is CenturyLink (formerly Embarq)
##The Zyxel was consistently under-performing and not delivering anything close to the bandwidth I was paying for
speed[@]##Probably because it was a G speed wireless router
##In addition, I suspected that the gateway was hanging up when I was doing some big file transfers over my home network
##The DLINK 655 appears to be flawless and is giving me close to the 10mb/s
antennas[@][u]##Wireless performance can vary greatly and the DLINK comes with three 
##One thing thing to note concerning Centurylink is that you must configure the modem properly
##What DLINK calls MER (MAC encapsulation routing) is what CenturyLink refers to DHCP
##That documentation difference caused me a few extra minutes on the phone and research to solve
##The router's blue lights are pretty bright so if its on your nightstand it may matter to you
[t] Bad Firmware turns one of the best to one of the worst
##It used to be one of the best networking product I had owned -- for almost two years, and then I followed the advice of router's 'Firmware Update Check' feature and upgraded to version 1
##3x (1
##31 and then 1
##32)
##Lo and behold, it made the networking device into a nightmare
##I cannot go a few hours before the router goes into a deadlock
##LAN doesn't work, Internet doesn't work, wired or wireless connections don't work, Router's admin page doesn't come up
##You have to power cycle the router to get it to respond again
##Worse yet, the router confuses the client computers with invalid DNS addresses and slows them down before eventually dying itself
##You can go to the DIR-655 page on dlink forums and see thread after thread complaining about these issues for firmware 1
##3x
##Unfortunately for all of us, the firmware cannot be rolled back to an earlier version, so if you are one of the unlucky ones, you have no option but to buy another router, until Dlink fixes it
##To make matters worse, Dlink has acknowledged the problem but claims to not be able to reproduce it in their labs and is not offering any workarounds or estimates of when this will get fixed
##I liked Dlink, and I still do, but if you buy a new DIR-655, chances are you will get stuck with firmware 1
##3x, so it's up to you to take you chances
##When it did work, it was one of the best
##Sad to see insufficient QA work ruin a good product and a good company
[t] Works great and yes I used a mac to set it up.
##Works great and I used my mac to set it up
##You do not need the included cd to set this router up
##just plug it in one of the 4 data ports and type the routers url into safari (http
[t] Second One Worked After A Lot of Frustration
##I received the first wireless routerD-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Routerand had a lot of trouble installing it
##The install disk did not work, but I was able to get it working once I contacted D-Link for help
internet[@]##However, it only worked for an hour and then I had no internet connection
##I spent a lot of time with Comcast thinking it was the modem, but hooking up a second computer showed that Comcast was OK
##I then tried D-Link, but got a surley tech who decided that all I could do was fix my computer
##I then tried CyberPower (my computer vendor) and got a very helpful tech who had me reinstall the network drivers (which took some time since my primary computer could not talk to the internet) and got it working again
internet[@]##With a good internet commection I was able to see that the D-Link router was not working (and somehow had corrupted my drivers)
##I used Amazon's replacement option and when the second one arrived I was able to use the install disk OK
##I give everyone but D-Link an A+ for their support
##With D-Link the first time I got someone who helped
##The second time I got someone who decided not to help
##Also, when you use the install disk it tries to install an additional cost program to manage the network
##Since I didn't want this, I had to go to the manual and find out how to install without this additional cost program
##But it works
##I sure would recommend trying another vendor other that D-Link however
##Bill
[t] Super easy to set up!!!!!
##Considering that i am a super super super low tech person
##This router is way too easy to set up
##I am a MAC user so the set up CD is useless for me
##Anyway, the manual setting at the back of manual sheet is really helpful
##Just do whatever they say step by step and then in less than 3 mins your house will turn to be a wireless spot
##yeah! it's that easy
##The signal range is perfect
##I don't have any problem at all even in i-thought-it-is blind spot
##I highly recommended!!!!
[t] Never More Disconnected
##Since I bought this wireless router I have never ever more experienced sudden disconnections
##I am truly happy with it
##The set up is easy but is better if you know a little of the stuff of instalation, since you will get better performance of your dlink router
##Do not hesitate, go and get it!
[t] Nice Features - Poor Support
##I recently purchased this wireless router due to the positive reviews and I NEEDED the QoS support
##I own a iMac G5
##It took hours (over 5) of playing to get this working and their phone support people were of no help (after 30 minutes of walking me through the basic config they told me that the product was defective and for me to return it)
##What is VERY INTERESTING is that the router can see the iMac mac address but not the IP address
##Also (from my work PC running Windows XP Pro) I can ping my work PC and my ISP from the router but I cannot ping my iMac
##From my iMac I can ping my work PC and my ISP but not the router (I get the following message; ping sendto
[t] Good upgrade, usb printer works
##I just received this and got it up and running
##Setup was straightforward and easy
##I'm replacing an old 150 ft D Link version with this to get more range, features etc
##After I got wireless up and running and pw protected home network connected to my 5 wireless things, (laptop, work laptop, android, ROKU, Kindle), I put the setup disk back in and installed the "share port" utility
##It loads with windows and yes I printed wireless successfully to my non-wireless printer w/o much hassle
##Plugged printer USB into back of router was about it
##So far I am pleased with the router
##Oh, and in case you are wondering, (I was) my new DIR-655 has HW version B1, FW version 2
##10 NA
##So it is the B version, not the older one
##I use Windows 7 on my primary laptop
[t] N>G
##I bought this router to upgrade an old linksys G router
speed[@]##I wanted the extended range and speed of N to cover my entire home
##I also wanted gigabit connections for my wired network so I could stream HD over the house
##Range
[t] The best wireless router
##I do network engineering for a living so I deal with a lot of networking issues and enterprise grade hardware
##For home use, this is what I have had in my house for more than 5 years!In my opinion this is the best home wireless router
##The version I have is quite a bit older and probably doesn't even have all the features of this version, but it has most of them and the basic unit has stayed the same
security[@]##It has a lot of features for WiFi setup and security settings, but is also easy to keep simple and it just works and keeps your network secure
##The best things about the wireless are it is very fast, good interoperability with different devices, and has super range
speed[@]##Another benefit is if you are looking for additional wireless endpoints, PCI cards, media bridge, USB adapters or whatnot, you practically guarantee great speed by using other D-Link products
##Some people complained about heat or the lights being too bright
##Hmm - well it does get hot and the lights are bright
security[@]##What can I say - if you are looking for great wireless signal and security then buy this
##I also see there is a newer version of this device that is completely different
##In my opinion I would buy this one instead and not the newer one
##The DIR-655 is a solid wireless router that will do everything you need
[t] My Tech Producer Had Me Order This
##We're a web design company, and we needed a robust, reliable router
internet[@]##We offer coworking workshops, and the internet _has to work_
##I wasn't sure about D-Link - I'm more familiar with Cisco and Belkin routers; have a Belkin at home
##But this sucker is fast and reliable
##We use it with Grande cable service
##Would order it again
##Good value!
[t] D-Link Router
##Great improvement over my previous router
##I'm very pleased with it and glad I purchased it
##Would highly recommend it
[t] USB Storage does not work
##The unit operates like the last three WAP's I have owned
##It does seem faster, but this is my first N
##The USB storage feature does not work
##The box says
[t] Its ok now
##when i first got this i just had to mess around with it because the default settings that came with the disc setup was just randomly disconnecting me with the most upgraded firmware
##After researching and setting it up manually i havn't had a issue yet so far but i know my day will come when it will cut off soon or later
[t] Like, like, like
##Super easy set up, took all of 10 minuets
##Looks good, reception and signal seem strong
speed[@]##Didn't notice a huge speed increase, but I'm sure that has more to do with my ISP (internet service provider)
port[@]##I used the USB port to add a network hard drive
##My only frustration is that in order to do so you need to run a program provided by D-link to access the drive
##It works great but It's one more program I have to keep up and running
##Also have to reestablish the "link" every time I resume from standby on my netbook
[t] Best router I've owned
##I've had this router for 2 or 3 years now, and it's fantastic
##I really don't have much else to say - I wish I'd bought it first instead of going through crappy Netgear and Linksys routers that stop working after a few months
[t] Decent Wireless Router
internet[@]##I purchased this router from Amazon when I switched over to Charter HS internet
##I previously had AT&T with an integrated DSL modem and wireless router
security[@]##Setup was very easy and security was easy to setup as well
##I have had no problems with this router so far
port[@]##I like the USB port on the router and have an external hard drive hooked to it
port[@]##I will say the Share Port utility which allows computers to access that port has a little to be desired
##It works and connects to the device fine
##It takes a long time for my computer to recognize the drive however
##My laptop is a new windows 7 laptop and plenty of memory and CPU so I know its not the computer
##If the recognition time was quicker I would be happy with that part of the router
##The signal of this router is good as well
##I didn't give it a 5 star based on the wireless bars on the computer is not as good as my old DSL router
##The signal is strong enough however that I can take my laptop anywhere in the house as well as outside by the pool and have plenty of signal
##I have never had to reboot the router since I have had it (about a month) and has worked as expected
##I have as many as 4 computers connecting wireless as well as my DVR connected and have not noticed any degradation in signal or response time
price[@]##Overall a good router at a fair price
[t] Unexpectedly awesome
##I wasn't really expecting too much from this router, by which I mean I was expecting it to be like every other router I've ever had, slowish and likely to need a hard reset every once in a while
streaming[@][u]##I was looking to upgrade from G to N for a bit of wireless 1080p video  and this router seems to be well reviewed, so I went with it
##Needless to say, the thing blew me away
##It was quick and easy to set up
##Streaming does what it is supposed to do
speed[@]##I did run into a little problem in that N+G mode resulted in reduced speed
##I would go with N mode exclusively, but I've got a legacy iPod Touch that doesn't play nice with N
##My solution has been to take my old G router and turn it into a wireless G access point, and keep the new router as N only
##That turned out to be amazingly simple
software[@][u]##I assume the simplicity is a result of the Tomato  I installed on the old G router, thus not really part of this review, but if you have legacy devices, I highly recommend going down the repurposing road, if you can
##Now, ordinarily if a device only meets my expectations, I only give 4 stars
##I'm giving this router 5 stars because I'm convinced it helps load pages faster
##I did nothing to our modem
##And big downloads aren't especially faster
##But the small burst speeds seem to be exponentially better
##I'm thinking this router has a really nice effect on latency times, though I don't game, so I have no real way of testing that
##Anyway, of all the routers I've purchased in my life, the easily the best
[t] D-Link DIR-655 is extremely easy to set up and to use
security[@]##The D-Link DIR-655 is so easy to set up, espcially the way the wizard coaches me how to set up the security feature with pass code
##It works very well so far for us
##The wireless range is work fine in our house arrangement
##I'm quite happy with this unit as this is the 1st time I got D-Link brand, and the 3rd time buying a wrieless router box
[t] Great Product
##I am so pleased with this Router
##I have had no problems and it has really made running four computers in one house at lot more reliable
##Buy it!!!
[t] Awesome product.
speed[@]##I had an old D-link g router that I wanted to upgrade to get better speed
##I went with D-link because I liked the old router I had
##This one set up and was running within 15 minutes of sitting down to install it
##I have pretty good ethernet connection through phone company and with the old D-link G router I was getting 54mbps on all 4 of the laptops in the house
##3 of those have G cards on board and 1 has an N card
##All 3 with on board G stayed at 54MBPS ( which they should) the one with built in N went up to 133MBPS
##When working from home with g router I would drop 7-8 times a day, last test with N+ I did not drop any
##Determined to get the best on the old laptops too, I purchased a Belkin USB n+ adaptor
##Once I installed adaptor on my laptop I started getting 133 MBPS with it as well
##Almost 3 times as fast as the old router connection
##Very nice!I would recommend this to any person looking for an N router
[t] Wonderful Router
##The house where I am using this router is VERY big in size and it works perfectly fine
##I connect two computers and both have all signal bars with no interruption
##If you are using PC computers the manual would be effectively easy to handle but not for MAC's computers
##If connecting a MAC like I did the manual wasn't useful at all, but you could find instructions on the WEB to help you connect the router, and it wasnt that difficult
[t] Great product!!
##I plugged it in and did the set up procedures and it is working great! I can even get reception outside in my backyard on my iPhone!!!
[t] Happy with it
##Prior to purchasing this router (2 weeks ago), I had another D-Link router that I've used for almost 6 years
internet[@][u],speed[@][u]##I wanted a router with better range and, with luck, a little more  (though I know the  of my  service is the determinant factor)
##I also didn't want to spend more than $100
##So far, I am very pleased with the device
##The range is improved (no surprise with N; prior router did not broadcast in N)
##I've also noticed that the web performance of my connected devices appears to be improved
##My PS3 (I do online gaming) signs into the PS network much faster
streaming[@]##Haven't tried Netflix on it since I bought it yet, but I'm hoping it will make the streaming experience a little better
##Set up wasn't too bad
##Anyone should be able to follow the instructions that come on the CD
##If you don't currently have an N router and want to "upgrade" for a decent price, this is a good product to look at
##I paid $70 and I'm pretty happy with it
[t] Awesome QoS! Able to play streaming video and not get kicked off of XBOX LIVE!
##I first got the D-Link DGL-4100 but that didn't seem to resolve my issues of getting kicked off of XBOX LIVE whenever my wife would stream videos
##It seemed that whenever a video was steaming I couldn't even connect! I then returned that D-Link DGL-4100 and got this one
##Ran through the initial disk setup with the defaults and am able to d/l 400 kbps torrents or stream video without getting kicked from XBOX LIVE! Awesome! I'm glad I picked up this router and I got it for around $85 shipped
##Also am glad that I didn't spend double the money to get one of the higher priced gaming routers
[t] Excellent router
##This thing is fantastic
##Lightning fast, utterly reliable, just rock solid
##I love it so much I'd marry it if the state of Virginia would allow it
##Set up was a pain, and I did have to call tech support
##I was on hold for 10 minutes, then got told it was another 20 minutes to talk to someone or they could call me back
##Frustration level was at a 10
##Call me back, I said
##Well, they did
##I was on the phone changing settings and typing in this and that for 10 minutes, and then it all worked
##Tech support did a great job
##This thing never drops a signal, works all over the house, and is lightning fast
##I'm very happy
##Best $72 I've spent in a good long while
##BTW, no issues with over-heating or anything like that, but it is in a basement that stays around 62 degrees
[t] Absolutely Blew Me Away!
##Hi
[t] Just found cheaper at walmart
##Good product but its sold cheaper at walmart
##I just figured it would be cheaper at amazon as they are usually cheaper
[t] V. Good wireless router
speed[@]##Our old router seemed to slowly loose speed and range as the years went by
##And my wifes iPhone just wouldn't link to it
##Easy to install - well, my son did it! All computers, wired and wireless now working much better
[t] Perfect router with a great QoS engine
##I tried a few different routers and finally settled with this D-LINK DIR-655
##The advanced models of D-LINK routers all have their great QoS engine, which is the best QoS among all the consumer router brands, I tried linksys, netgear, trendnet etc
##Non comes close to the advanced functionality of this router
##I think for 99% of home users, this router is the perfect choice right now
##update 5/5/2011 - after using this router for 5 month, it suddenly started to drop wifi every morning, around the same time
##Wierd
##I had to set up a scheduled job to reboot the router every morning to avoid this problem
##Otherwise everything else is still working great
##update 5/25/2011 - changing my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star
##After the wifi problem a few weeks ago, now the router is simply slow, when I play online games, I've gotten pings of 7200+, extremely laggy, nothing seems to help
##I've given up and bought a new ASUS router
##This router was good until it started to crap out
##So reliability is really iffy, though performance was good while it worked
[t] working fine so far!!
##It is working fine in a small place
##easy to get started
##and I like the brand, I`ve had a D-Link for 4 yrs, and I just had to change now as the old one was beggining to fail, although it still works most of the times!!!
[t] Works well
internet[@][u]##I found the unit easy to install once I got the correct IP address for my computer from my  provider
##The tech support that helped me diagnosis the wrong IP address was very good
##My wife and I are very pleased
##Now she can use her laptop anywhere in the house with more than 50% signal

[t] Good Router for all Purpose
##This is my second router from after using Dlink 624 for pretty long time
##This router is worth of buck as the signal strength is too stronger with no interference especially to watch HD stuff
internet[@],streaming[@][u]##I watch tv shows over internet TV and the  is good so far
##The reliability factor is huge on Dlink
##The setup was just 10 min job and I need not run through the manual at all
##The design of device should have been better with BuiltIn Antenna
[t] Latest Model works great and is feature rich!
##I am not a techie but had no trouble replacing my old Linksys G router with this new D-Link DIR-655
##My reasons for change were two
[t] Totally worth each cent you paid!
##This is an amazing product! I bought it a few weeks ago
##We had a new cable line installed, and the cable folks provided us with the standard cable modem
##There are around 4 ~ 5 people at home at any given moment, each with their own laptop, and thus, we got this for our wireless needs
##I must say this was one of my best investments
##The setup took hardly a few minutes
##Everything was well explained
##I use a mac, and I set up using the "manual method"
##For windows users, it has a disc which does it for you
##It was super easy to get it connected, almost like "plug-n-play" The user interface for the device configuration is pretty straightforward, owing to which we had secured wireless in the house in under 5 minutes
##We live on the third floor of an apartment complex
internet[@]##The other day I tried to access the internet when I was out on the street, right outside my apartment
##Guess what? My mobile device showed me a full signal for the wireless
##And this is not even placed by the window
##My friend whose room is two rooms and a passage away from the router gets full connectivity
##It has awesome signal strength and it makes the most out of your cable connection
##LAN gaming is like a charm with this router
##No network related lags, disconnections or such
##I am highly impressed
##We used to have a Motorola SURFboard Gateway SBG901 DOCSIS 2
##0 Wireless Cable Modem, and it was one of the most pathetic modems that I had used
##I don't know about the others, but we faced severe network lags and frequent disconnections and restarts while gaming
##However, the D-Link is a total charm
##If you are reading this review then probably you are considering "actually" buying a router
##I suggest go for it, as you will be searching more and coming back to this very page!
[t] I reboot this router daily to maintain reliability
##I've had this router for about a year and a half
##Early on, it would randomly lock up such that attached computers would not have access to the internet, and external computers couldn't access the router
##I would manually reboot the router which would resolve the issue 100% of the time
##This would happen about once a month for about a year
##About 6 months ago it started occurring more frequently, about once a week
##This became very intolerable as I have inbound functionality as well
##Until I decide to buy a new router, I put in one of those very cheap power timers and turn power off to the router for 15 minutes every night to effectively reboot it
##I think there are random hardware issues with this router
##That in combined with the reported D-Link customer service experience, makes this a hard buy
##I'll be looking for a better more reliable router
[t] GREAT UNIT
##I have a network of macs and windows pcs and had problems setting up a Net Gear wireless router
##So I read some reviews and opted for this D-Link unit
security[@]##It connected in seconds, the interface was very intuitive and user friendly, setting up security and my various computers was a breeze and its range and power surpasses my previous Linksys router, which performed well with my hardwired computers but lost connectivity many times for all my wireless laptops
##Furthermore it was an outdated wireless-B unit
##Therefore, I am very pleased with this router and highly recommend it
[t] Easy setup, works well
##I'm not a computer novice, but configuring this kind of device intimidates me
##Happily, it took no time at all to set it up, connect it, and the configuration was pretty much automatic
##The instructions said not to put it near a computer but, duh, it has to be hooked up to it, so I had no choice
##And signal comes through just fine despite that
##It was a rare pleasure to buy something and have it up and running so quickly and easily
[t] excellent
##This is the 5th router I have owned and by far the best
##Easy to setup
##excellent configurable options and most of all it performs extremely well
##My only wish is to have the ability to turn off the lights
[t] Works well so far.
##I have been using this for about two months now
##I am not using any advanced features just the basics
##It is about 3-4 times faster than my previous G router
##Range is OK
##Setup was basic
##Has not dropped connection yet
##Satisfied so far
[t] Best wireless router I've owned
##Over the last decade, I've owned 4 wireless routers (1 Dell, 2 Netgears and 1 DLink) and the DIR-655, which I've used for more than 2 years now, is by far the best one I've had
internet[@]##Very easy to setup, lots of features (I personally love its guest-zone feature, which I use by making invisible the main SSID that provides access to my NAS, and still provide a guest SSID with an access-key that I feel comfortable providing to people visiting my place and wanting to connect to the internet via my wireless router)
##I had problems in the past with its USB-share-port feature (to share a printer) in previous firmwares, but it has worked flawlessly since firmware 34
speed[@]##Wireless speed and connectivity are excellent too
##Highly recommended
[t] Highly Recommended Router
##I have some notes at the end, for specific topics if any are interested
##The THAT IS SO WIZARD
[t] Stability problems.
##This has been my latest waste of money in a long line of 802
##11n routers that just don't work
##Some overheat and crash, others (inexplicably) don't support UPnP, and then there's the DIR-655
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##I was very intimidated with setting this up
##You know, for a non-tecki, you worry about breaking something and not being able to fix it
##One of the reasons I bought this was the prompt reply form tech support to my e-mail, less than 10 minutes, this was before I bought the DIR-655
##I pluged it into the power, pluged into the compuer, turned every thing on and everything configured it self so fast I was afraid I had broke something
##I am using Win 7, and it did everything for me
##Everything worked including the 2 Kindles and the 2 laptops
##I never used the disk that came with the DIR 655
##I was worried that I had not done everything right because it was so quick
##I called tech support to be reassured, (its tough to be old and don't know any thing about this new fangled stuff) but the tech support guy assured me it was all done and to not worry about it anymore
##And I haven't
##It works great
[t] There are better routers than this, weak signal
##I have been using a Cisco-Linksys WRT54G wireless router with fairly good success
##It is in the basement of an 1800 SqFt house
##The router is 7 yrs old and figured while upgrading a completed home theater system maybe it was time to upgrade the wireless router
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router signal strength was no more than half the linksys signal
##Also, connections were lost in rooms upstairs directly above the router
##I re-installed the Linksys and not one connection has been dropped for over a month now
##This DLink router was a waste of $80
##Maybe Ebay will help me recover half
[t] Simple and stable
##I purchased this router after my previous wireless router was dropping wireless connections and had to be rebooted several times per week
##After four months of use, I've not had a single problem with this router
##Simple to setup and use
##I have a large 2-story house and was somewhat concerned if it would have sufficient range, but it reaches the far corners of our house just fine
##As another reviewer said, the blue lights are pretty bright, but mine is in a closet so it's not an issue for me
[t] Stoped working after 3 months
##Long story short
##The unit failed to work after only 3 months
##The replacement sent was used, filthy, and also does not work
##I am in the process of getting a different model as dlink does not issue refunds
[t] Bad unit, bad customer support
##There was a problem with set up
##I called Customer Service and spent 10 minutes with a guy trying to give me "free" stuff for $11
##95 cause I was the 100th caller
##I kept asking if this was D-Link's customer service and was assured that it was
##I kept saying I didn't want the "free" stuff, just answers to a set up problem and he kept telling me he would get to it as soon as his computer booted the info and then continued to try to get me to take the "free" stuff
##After hanging up I called back and got the same
##"congratulations, you're the 100th caller, etc
##" Finally just returned the router to D-Link
[t] A Good Buy
##The wireless router was easy for a non technical person to set up and has been working great since it was set up a month ago
##A great value for home wireless
##My TV, Satellite, Blu-Ray and even my phone work great with this
[t] QOS Engine not compatible with all ISPs
##Initally, this router worked fine
##But after several weeks the modem (SB6120) kept locking-up and requiring a power reset to get it working again
##This happened almost every 1-2 days
internet[@]##I went in circles between the ISP (Cox Comm) and Motorola (modem) in attempts to find the cause of the internet loss
##With no luck, I just systematically turned on all non-essential services on this router until the modem no longer locks-up
##It turns out that the Dlink QOS engine was the culprit
internet[@]##So, with QOS disabled, I have no more problems with the internet drops
[t] Great Product
##Bought this router about 8 months ago
##It installed easily and was up and running in minutes
##I have 2 Macs, a linux server, and 2 windows pc's with a mix of 1gbs and 100mbs lan access rates
##All connected quickly and easily
##I set up 2 wireless networks on the router
##One for my computers and 1 for guests
##Internet access is through cox
speed[@]##net using a motorola surfboard sb6120 high speed cable modem
##Performance is much better than the G router it replaced
##Reliability has been excellent
[t] A little more power a little more price
##I bought this router in an effort to improve my throughput in my home
##Actually I see no difference in performance, other than being a little prettier
##If you can settle for your current router, do it
##Don't waste the money on something that may not really improve your performance
##Wait until Draft O comes out in a couple years
[t] Wireless Nirvana
##As a PC / Network technician by day and an avid gamer by night, setting up routers is nothing new to me
##I honestly did not try any of the built in Wizards in the DIR-655 and went straight for the manual setup, since I knew what I wanted and needed
##Bottom line
[t] Works well with MacBook
##I replaced my old LinkSys wireless router with this one
##Compared to the LinkSys, D-Link has a much better management menu and online support
##It was simple to set up
##As a Mac user, I had read several comments in Apple's discussion forum advising NOT to use the Setup Wizard CD that it comes with
##so I didn't
##I had also reviewed just about all of the 80211n wireless routers, and found this one to be the best value for Mac
##Upgrading the firmware can be tricky and kind of a pain -- be sure you use a WIRED connection (not wireless) when you install firmware, and DON'T use any saved configurations
##The signal very rarely pops out on me
##The signal strength isn't always perfect, but that's probably because I set up the system inside a TV console -- not the most open area
##The icons for the various settings are small and hard to see
##I had to use an online reference
##Also, I had read that the all-blue lights drove some users crazy, and they are bright
##But I just turned the device so the lights don't face out and it's fine
##It looks kinda cool too
[t] Very good router
##I've been a Linksys owner for nearly 7 years, and I always enjoyed their products
##But that time, I looked for a Gb router + N wireless
##Then there is not much of a choice
##Also it looks like the Linksys quality drops since they've been acquired, so I decided to buy my first D-link
##The overall experience so far is very positive
##Very easy to setup via the web interface (although some menus might look a bit confusing), it worked out-of-the-box
##I liked some minor features like binding an IP to a MAC address (very usefull if you want to share a printer among several OS, including old Windows 2000, who are not too good at detecting printers on the network) makes managing your home office network easy
##I notice that in mix mode (N+A/B/G), windows 2000 will freeze or crash
##No issue for windows XP, Vista, and Mac
##Meaning, if you want to take advantage of the N-wireless, better to update your OS's
##There are plenty of customization that gamers will love, where you can prioritize network ressources to specific application
##No use for me, but worth mentionning
##I strongly recommend that product!
[t] Used to rely on Linksys, the DIR-655 makes me a D-Link fan!
##Bought the DIR-655 in March 2007 and have never had a problem with it
##It runs 24/7 and I use 2 wireless laptops and a desktop, have home VoIP, and do some online gaming
##I added a wireless printer (Lexmark) and also never had any issues
##The Firmware was always easy to upgrade, and the same to save and restore your settings
##I would highly recommend the DLink 11n devices since several other views comparing Linksys to DLink shares my impressions
##Linksys got lazy, and D-Link has made up big time for previous issues
[t] A Seamless Upgrade!
##I expect my wireless network to provide a high level of service with a broad range (so I can take wireless PC's outside in various places, etc
##), and had been very disappointed with the old 802
##11G product (also D-Link) I had been using
##The DIR-655 plugged in and my network (8 machines plus network storage) was up in minutes - and ALL of my complaints about range and signal strength are gone
##It is simply the best home networking product I've ever purchased
##Highly recommended!
[t] I didn't even know...
##that changing a router could make such a huge difference in my connection speeds
##From my old router to this D-Link, my Internet pages load *noticeably* faster
##I was clicking random links and purposely went to sites loaded with images, cuz I couldn't believe it at first
##I play online games and there's no more lag
internet[@]##I thought I just had a bad internet connection, but nope it was just my old router!There were no drivers to install, literally just plug and play
##If you've ever used any router before, you can use this one without looking at the Quick Setup guide or using the CD
##The configuration page that opens in your web browser offers a lot of options, but it's divided into Basic and Advanced, so if you don't know what all those options mean, just ignore them
security[@]##The only thing is, I couldn't figure out how to set up WEP security (I didn't really try too hard), so now I'm just on WAP2
##That means I can't connect to it using my Nintendo DS, but that's no big deal
##I'm definitely gonna look into getting the corresponding wireless adapter
##I've never used D-Link before, and I think I might be a convert
[t] New generation of wireless router
##The router works great for my home network with very stable connections for my VOiP phone and mutiple wireless laptops
[t] Great Router
##Although not the cheapest router and probably not as good as the Apple version, I have been very happy
##I have 2 macs and a PC and they all connected with little effort
##The professional reviews which state that this is difficult to use are nuts
[t] Great Router
speed[@]##This router has excellent range and excellent speed
##I had a linksys G router before this and this one gets about twice the range and downloads about 1
##5 times faster than my previous router
##I would recommend this router to anyone who is interested in buying a new router
[t] worked for a year
##worked great for a year
##shortly after the warranty expired the wireless conections started dropping
##the wireless drops got worse - multiple times an hour - even when sitting in the same room as the router
##i did all the appropriate troubleshooting (i'm a network administrator, not a noob)
##now i'm replacing it
price[@]##was very happy with it when it worked, just wish it had a life longer than one year, espeically for the price
[t] Reliable and easy to setup
##This was my first router
##It was easy to setup and has been reliable since connecting
##The router is in the lower level of house (in a cabinet) of a two story house
##I have had no issues with using a desktop, two laptops, and Wii
##Amazon (Beach Camera) delivered on time
##No issues
##I researched the best routers for the money and was looking at Linksys
price[@]##However, I was swayed by price of this router along with consumer reviews
##I read a ton of reviews from various sites before purchasing on line and my research paid off with this router
##Good product!
[t] 2nd purchase of exact same product
##I purchased this product about two years ago to make a PS3 wireless
##I now use it for my laptop and BlackBerry as well
##I was always taking my PS3 to my Uncle's, and he finally decided to get one
##He didn't want to run wires all the way to the PS3, especially considering his computer was mainly used for games anyway
##I knew that the router would not intefere with his computer, and my Aunt was thinking about getting a laptop
##I also wanted to be able to get on my laptop and PSP when I went to his house, and because this product has been so good to me, I decided to get him the exact same one
##The signal has always been excellent, I have never had a problem with mine, and because of this, I got the exact same router for my Uncle
##He has now had it in his house for a month-in-a-half
##Initially he was skeptical of it and thought it might let others into his computer, but I explained I put a password on it, even though he lives on 10 acres and his nearest neighbor is 200 yards away
##His signal does go very far
##I can sit at the end of his driveway and still get a good signal
price[@][u],speed[@]##The  is high, but considering you never have to worry about a bad signal, the product is a quality product, set-up is straight forward, and the speed is very fast, I would recommend this router to everyone
[t] D-Link Wireless N DIR-655
##When our D-Link Gigabit Router Wireless N DIR-655 arived, my first impression was, this thing is to complicated
##But after reviewing my router tecknology, and the D-Link docs, we found that setting it up for use was easy
##The thing we are happy to have is the increase in netwok proformance, and also the improvements in video speeds,uploads and downloads of large files across the network
##This is a Good Router for the price, so I will give itan "OK"
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless RouterThe DIR-655 Router works well on all features
##There are 4 aspects to be improved
[t] So far so good
##I got the router delivered to me yesterday and set up last night
##The first test I did was to transfer a 3GB file and I have to say it was pretty fast
security[@]##I have to admit that setting up the wireless security wasn't too intuitive
##The latency was pretty good while playing PS3/PC games without making any adjustments in the router
##I'm looking forward to tweaking the router
##There are too many features to handle in one sitting and without thinking it through
##This is definitely not recommended for noobs but more towards intermediate to expert people familiar with networking
[t] OK for sharing an internet connection, but...
##I purchased this wireless router to replace an ethernet (wired) firewall router coupled with a 802
speed[@]##11g wireless access point, which couldn't handle the recently upgraded speed offered by my ISP
internet[@],speed[@]##Although it improved my network connection speed to the internet (permitting the full 20MB/sec download speed), it severely crippled the ability to share printers on my network
software[@],port[@]##My old network was capable of printer sharing that was nearly instantaneous; with this D-Link DIR-655, a single page text-only document now takes more than ten minutes to print over the network! Three phone calls to D-Link technical support finally revealed that aside from the USB port sharing capability on the router, there is no solution addressing the ability to truly share printers efficiently across the network as of 08/22/2009, and no estimated date for a software or firmware update
##I am unimpressed by both the product and the D-Link technical support
##Fortunately, it appears that amazon
##com will accept this router as a return for refund
[t] Works well
##After going through a couple of flaky Linksys routers of similar functionality, it was nice to find a router that just works
##This one was easy to set up, I just went through the menus and set things up as Comcast needed them (MAC address), turned off Qos and WISH (I may come back to them at some point), configured the wireless (WPA2/AES), and so on
##Then plugged it into the cable modem, reset the cable modem, and everything just worked
##Wonderful
internet[@]##Keeps up with Comcast internet no problem, and the Gb
##hard-wired ports are great
##The wireless covers the house
##We have 2 hard-wired computers, Windows XP and Windows Vista, plus a Windows XP laptop and a Windows Vista laptop, everything just works, all at the same time, too, no reboots needed, a nice change from Linksys
##Works well, all I can ask a router to do
##ADDED
[t] Great Router.
##I had a Netgear router, connection was dropping every time
##I needed to replace it with this router
##The router Admin has a ton of features
##Even you can make router to sleep from midnight to 6 AM
##I get around 17 Mbps on LAN and around 7 MBPS on wireless
##I was getting half on my previous G router
[t] User friendly for the technically challenged
##I can't discuss the technical viewpoints for the DIR 655, but I know it has worked without a hitch for me
##I was able to follow instructions without help and set up my wired pc and wireless laptop to it and I am online whenever I want
##I have not had any instance of it being hot to the touch or putting off heat like a previous user experienced
##I recommend it
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
[t] Great Router
##Works great
##We have it on the third floor of our house and you can get great speeds from anywhere
##Even in my garage
##I recommend
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Xtreme N wireless router
##I replaced a Linksys Wireless G router which was just not getting the job done
##My home network is on two different floor levels and at opposite ends of a fairly large house
##The D-Link DIR-655 signal is making the trip with no problems
##Installation was quick, simple and actually worked the first time
price[@]##I would highly recommend with the caveat to shop around for the best price available
##got mine from Amazon
[t] Not bad....
##The directions could have been clearer
software[@]##on the disk it indicates that you must install the enclosed software on any computer that will use your Wireless N Router
##not true
##Also, they don't mention that even after you successfully set up the router, you will need to reboot a few times to have it connect wirelessly
##Once set up was complete, it works well
[t] Better range than my old Linksys
##I bought this hoping that I could get a little better range than my Linksys WRT546GS
##I've had that router for a couple years now, and it was great for that time, but I figure that's long enough for a router, so I thought I'd try the DLink
##Works great
##Easy setup (as I experienced with Netgear, but not necessarily with Linksys, as I recall)
##I don't know about the N standard, have no devices that use it, but I do know that my B and G devices are showing faster and stronger connection speeds with this router than the Linksys
##It's located, btw, upstairs in a two-story house, behind a closed door
##All the computers are downstairs
##I'll need to check online if anything can be effectively hooked up to the USB port, because a big harddrive would be nice
[t] Best Solution Thus Far
##For almost a year I battled with a Linksys Wireless-G Broadband Router model WRT54G
##I thought there was something wrong with my laptop's wireless card because it wouldn't connect to this wireless router even when it was right next to it
##On occasion my PC, which was hooked to the router, would bomb as well
##I read some reviews that said the D-Link DIR-655 was a good buy
##I picked one up and have been impressed with its quality ever since
##Install took me about 10 minutes using the disk and instructions provided
##After setting up my PC I set up my laptop
##My laptop's card immediately found the D-Link router
##I linked the two together and have had no problems since then
##In fact, I'm receiving a strong signal throughout the entire house (and the backyard)
streaming[@]##I'm able to watch streaming videos in the living room without a hint of delay
##A week ago I purchase a PS3
##It reported my router as outputting a signal of 97% strength
##Set up was easy
##Now I'm able to connect to both the laptop and the Playstation 3 with ease
##Nothing is perfect, but so far I've been pretty happy with this router
##I'm impressed
##It's quick, it's got a strong signal, and it reaches every room in my house
[t] Hate messing with networks? Then buy this router!
##Long story short
[t] Great performance, great price
##I ordered what was advertised as an open-box product from Amazon Warehouse (around $20 less than the regular discounted price)
##It arrived promptly and in perfect condition, with no sign that it wasn't brand new
##The included CD has Network Magic, which makes the setup very easy
##The router quickly found all my wired and wireless connections, although it did not find an Internet connection
##I called D-Link technical service and the rep walked me though the manual setup menu, which is accessed by typing the router's IP address in the browser window
##It was easy enough that I probably should have figured it out myself, but the call took only around 10-15 minutes, including a hold time of only a minute or two
##Performance has been terrific
##I get a strong signal all though the house and on my back patio, through three walls, even though the router is located under my desk, on top of the CPU
##(The manual suggests placing it away from the computer, above furniture)
##I also have cordless 2
##4 GHz telephones in the house, and there have been no problems with interference
[t] Works great once configured right
##2 days after getting the router, it works as a charm
internet[@],speed[@]##The only major problem I ran into was that my cable internet connection speed dropped 80% or more when the router was first plugged in
##It took me a day to figure out the real problem
[t] Awesome Wireless router
##I have only had the wireless router for 3 months now and had not had a problem with it
speed[@]##the speed is fast
##make sure that you do go out and get the update firmware
##I noticed that right off the bat that is seem to perform better than without
##This router is a plug and play just by running the disc that comes with it
software[@][u]##You just need to make sure that your  firwall is not blocking the ports that you need to access when setting up
##The one thing that I think is nice is the advanced features for when you want to do video streaming, mp3 to wireless speakers in the house and if you decide use a media extender the DIR-655 will be able to support it
installation[@]##The downside it does not come with written manual you have to get it from the installation disc
##I would recommend going out and purchasing
##This router is backward compatible to B,G wireless cards
##I do not know if I will go and buy a PCI N card for my laptop as of yet
##I did three months of research on this router before I bought it and I am glad I did
[t] Great Product
##The performance and setup of the D-Link DIR-655 are wonderful
software[@]##I agree with other posts that you don't need to install the software that comes with the router; a user with moderate software experience can have everything working in less than an hour
[t] Great Router
##Bought this same model about 5 years ago for $129 and it worked great but started having issue with losing signal
price[@]##When researching for a replacement, this one still had great reviews and the price ($67) was reasonable for the feature set
##Like having features like MAC filtering and QoS for using a VOIP phone (Ooma)
##The new one has the same name but the firmware was 2
##x vs
##1
##x
##User interface and the lights on the face panel are slightly different but so far it works great and get reliable signal over 100 feet away from base
[t] Great on paper, not so much in the field.
##About myself
[t] Not deserve the price.
##Too expensive if you buy it at a normal price, I will prefer ASUS RT-N16 or even E3000 from Linksys
##But DIR-655 has a nice base to let the device standing vertically which the latter lack
[t] Don't buy this router!!!
##Don't buy this router
##It's very unstable and offer poor performances
##After a week I can't figure what the problem is
##My Blu-Ray player can see the network and the day after it can't
##Files transfer can take hours
##I think I will throw it in the garbage and go purchase an other brand at Best Buy!
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme
##This router is used for a small office network and is used as a wired router
##It is easy to set up and data is fast
[t] Great router

##I had to put tape over them as the room looked like a disco at night
[t] Extreme-ly Satisfied
##Unit replaced older D524 and worked perfectly out of the box
##Admin settings wizard a breeze and within a few minutes I had locked out the neighbor and enable the wired and wireless devices throughout the house - including two game systems
##Excellent reception through three levels and no traffic jams
##Recommended
[t] completely satisfied
##This was easy to set up; I had no trouble and I am not a computer whiz
##I am extremely pleased with how well it works
##This is the first router I have ever purchased and set up and highly recommend it to anyone
[t] So many bars, I'm feeling tipsy!
##I thought I was going to have to hardwire my new house and buying this router was the last attempt before throwing in the towel
##I had tried two routers before buying this one and couldn't get more than 1 bar in other rooms, now I have 5 throughout
##Highly recommend
[t] Good product, very satisfied
##This is a quality product
##It works well throughout the house - nice strong signal
##I use it with my Roku box and it works great
[t] Great While it was Still Working
##The Set up was relatively easy
##Seemed pretty fast as well, but it died the week after the warranty expired, Plus to call for Tech Support you have to pay a fee after 1 year
##Pretty frustrating
##I've heard these are usually pretty reliable, guess I got a Lemon and no help from D-Link
[t] Doesn't have good range
##I have AT&T; uVerse with the 2wire gateway/router
##The 2wire only has 802
##11g and I wanted to update my wireless to 802
##11nPurchased this router with the intention of shutting off the 2wire access point and using the dlink as an access point only
##Setup was really easy, took less than 5 minutes to get it configured and running on my network
##The router works pretty good
##I didn't have any issues with the wireless connection as long as there was a signal
##The deal breaker for me was the range
##The dlink has far worse range than the 2wire
##My office is at the front of the house on the first floor while the router/access point is on the second floor inside the master bedroom closet(both the 2wire and dlink are at the same place)
##With the 2wire, at least I can get a signal in my office
##With the dlink, the connection would drop periodically
antennas[@][u]##Re-positioning the  does not seem to help at all
##I really wanted to keep this router
##But with the signal issues in my office, it is going back to amazon
[t] Disappointing router
##I had high expectations for this router based on reviews
##Unfortunately, it doesn't hold a candle to the Linksys I replaced
##It was easy to install but that's where the praise stops
##The signal strength is much lower on all devices being used in the same places throughout the house
streaming[@][u]##Worse yet, the signal is dropped entirely at intermittant times meaning  video is a nightmare to watch
##I wish I hadn't installed my old router at my mothers! Now I will toss this one and buy something other than D-Link new
[t] Terrible Product
##Easy to setup
##However, the router would only work for a few hours at a time before requiring a power cycle to get it working again
##Tried reconfiguration, nothing helped
##I was hoping for better range performance than the Linksys router that I currently have
##No!! During the short working durations, the range was no better at all
##Fortunately Amazon processed my refund quickly
##That was about the only positive thing I can say about this purchase
[t] Nice range increase
antennas[@][u]##Previously, I had an inexpensive router with two internal 
##I was having range problems where devices in another room could no longer connect to the router after being put in a new furniture unit
antennas[@]##This D-Link router with it's three external antennas allows them to connect fine, with a strong signal
##Setup is fairly good, about on par with linksys
port[@][u]##It also has a USB  which seems a much nicer solution to sharing a printer between multiple computers
price[@]##For the price I'd definitely recommend this router
[t] Great Wireless Router
##I had a bit of trouble finding a wireless router that worked for me
##This one is GREAT in all respects
##I had been using a wireless router for several years and it just stopped working
##So that put me on the path of looking for routers at our local stores
##The first router (from Office Depot) I got seemed to work for my wired connections, but the wireless was so slow that it took minutes to bring up web pages
##I took that one back and bought a much more expensive N router from Costco
##That router worked, but the signal was so weak that some of my portable devices would not connect from a room across our home
##Both of those went back and I started looking at all of the reviews on Amazon
##Frankly, I was a bit worried about buying this router after reading some of the reviews
##One person commented that this router had lights so bright you could read by them at night and that it got so hot you couldn't put your hand on it
##I'm not finding that to be the case at all
##I've had this running for several hours now, and it is cool to the touch
##The wireless signal is strong everywhere in the house, and it seems even faster than my original wireless router
##To make things even better, this was the easiest router to set up of all of them
##The CD that came with it leads you through the setup, step by step
##You can configure everything without going into the detailed menus, but those are available too if you feel the need to do more
##I'm impressed with the quality, the speed, the packaging, and even the way it looks
[t] I wish it was better.
##I've had this router for 2 1/2 years and I've been very happy with it for the most part
##It's served my purposes well with very little fuss
##I also get a lot of compliments on the look of it
##The white case with blue LED lights is pretty slick and modern! It looks great next to my Wii
##I do have a few complaints, though
##For one, it isn't put together very well
##The antennae fell off and I've had a heck of a time trying to get them back into the unit with no success
##As a result, my signal isn't as strong as it could be
##I've also had issues with this dropping my connection
##The only way I'm able to fix that is to unplug the router and plug it back in
##Then it carries the signal just fine
##The set-up was also a bit of a pain
##Very confusing and didn't quite work right
##Overall, I like this router and wish more care was put into its construction
[t] Works As Intended
##The router works as stated
installation[@]##The installation disk that comes with the box makes it very simple to setup your wireless router for the entire household (or wherever you're installing it)
security[@]##The disk also ensures that even a beginner at setting up a wireless connection could do so properly with basic security also established
##Unrelated to the mechanics of the router, I thoroughly enjoyed the compact appeal of the router as well
##Though it does tend to generate heat more so than my previous routers that I've installed
[t] Speed and ease of use is wonderful
##This router is being used as a wireless access point in my network at my company
##Configuration was easy and the range on it is good
##Speed is great too
port[@]##I have 3 PCs and this router configured into one D-Link 8 port GB switch
##They work well in tandem
##Speed and range are great too
##I would recommend this item to anyone for home or work use
[t] Comcast guy recommended this router, best I've ever owned..
##Out looking at the competition for this router, and after reading so many horrible reviews for all the latest competitive products (dual band rounters) I've decided to keep this one
##I've owned it since 2008 (!) and it's been the most solid and fast router I've ever had
##I had many before this router, so when the Comcast guy came by to install my cable modem, I asked him what he recommended
##He didn't hesitate to tell me the D-Link router was by far the most successful model he had seen out in the field
##I followed his advice, glad I did
##I think I might have installed new firmware once, but this router stays up for months at a time without touching it
##Let me qualify that
[t] Fast
##My old wireless router is too slow, so I choose this one
##Now I can watch movie and play games online with the new router
[t] Will not connect at N speeds, maxes out at 65 mbps.
##I bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless N speeds
##It would max out at 65 mbps
##When I reset it, like unplugging it and plugging it back in, I would get the N speeds 150 mbps the first time it connected and would transfer files at that speed, then usually next time I connected it would drop back to 65 or 52 mbps and stay at these speeds
##I Googled "d-link dir-655 65 mbps max" and found that a lot of people are having this problem
##Called their support, they didn't have a clue so I returned it and I am looking for something else that will give me 150 mbps
[t] Finally, A router that just works!
##I have a collection of 4 other routers
##All have had continuing problems of mysteriously dropping connections and forcing the whole reconnection process
##I have had this router for over a month and it is working flawlessly
##Easy to install, not a single drop-out
##Hooks up quickly to my wireless devices
##I am finally able to forget about constant reconnecting
##Done
[t] Very please with this new router.
internet[@][u]##We use the  a lot at our house
##We have 3 laptops and one desktop
internet[@]##Plus our HD TV is on WIFI, we use Direct TV Whole home for watching DVR programs in the office, as well as two Direct TV receivers have wired internet connections
internet[@][u]##We can download content to the DVR from the 
##Thus we use a lot of bandwith
##This router is able to handle the loads no problem
security[@]##Since we increased the WIFI security level, the encryption keys are longer, but that is to be expected
##I also like the fact this router shows you what devices are connected
##A very nice feature
##I would recommend this router
[t] Shareport doesn't work... for anybody.
##I purchased this router mainly for its usb shareport ability
##It doesn't work though
##I went online to see what the problem was
##Turns out shareport doesn't work for anybody
software[@]##It worked when it first came out, but an update to the software rendered it extremely un-reliable
##It will connect for about a day, and then you have to reboot the router to get it working again
##Total crap product
##I wouldn't buy this router if you plan to use its shareport functions
##Otherwise, the router works fine
[t] Very disappointed
speed[@]##I bought this router expecting an increase in range and speed compared to my G linksys router
##What a joke, it's actualy slower,looses its signal very frequently
##Its a pain in the butt
##I wasted my money and all I can do is throw it to the garbage
##Do not buy this piece of junk!
[t] The Bomb Diggity!!!!
##D-Link 655 is very easy to set up using the CD it came with, just a caution at the end for this router
##The Item works great
##I have had a D-Link 612 for many years, maybe about 6 years
##It has performed well until all these wireless items started coming out, like printers, Blueray players, Laptops, and Desk top computers
##Maybe in the future the refrigerator will be connected
##I know Thermostats and lighting might be connected or to run the whole home to access the items from outside the home
##With all the extras, my D-Link 615 started to overload and shut down and had to be reset with unplugging the power
##They dont last forever
security[@]##The one thing they should put in the instructions, which security encryption for specific operating systems
##DO NOT USE WPA encription for Windows XP, use WEP
##That was the only problem I had setting D-Link 655 router up
##I highly recommend a D-LINK 655
##I dont know much about newer ones with duel frequency, the only option I would love to have had was guest sign in capabilities
##I didnt need the other
##I give family and friends my code to get into the network anyhow
##D-Link is a trustworthy company, I read many reviews from D-Link, Link SyS (Cisco), and Netgear, seems people have trouble setting up and maybe they are not experienced enough, or too experienced and get into items they shouldnt have
##I am almost a novice and it was easy
##Dont beleve most of the bad reviews
[t] Not the router for me... The search continues for a decent router
##Bought this router last week after seeing all of the positive reviews online
##After a week of using, I will be returning
##I have to reset this router everyday
##I even bought the D-Link ANT24-0230 Xtreme N 2
antennas[@][u]##4GHz Antenna to replace the stock  and nothing
##I'm going to go ahead and fork out $179
##00 for the Apple airport extreme because I'm so done with the router search
##Belkin, D-Link, Netgear
##all junk so far
##Come on Apple!
[t] Bad range
##I had trouble setting up this router
##Only because I followed the easy setup wizard
##The range is worse than my older wireless g router
##But the ratings say it is better
##Whats up with that
##I definitely wouldn't recommend due to range and no wireless bridge capability according to d-link
##Isn't this suppose to be a wireless router
##My old router has wireless bridging capabilities
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router
[t] Very Difficult
##Got this off of a recommendation and had trouble with it from the beginning
##Had to reset it at least once a day and I couldn't print wirelessly
##Bad customer service as well
##Sent it back
##Very disappointed
[t] LOVELY PRODUCT DOES ITS JOB
##D-LINK DIR-655 EXTREME N GIGABIT WIRELESS ROUTERDID THE JOB
##WHAT A STRONGER BOOST FOR HOME RECEPTION AND IT DID THAT
[t] Defective out of the box.
##I bought this along with the DWA-140 wireless adapter and had high hopes for a long range, fast network
##After an hour with tech support, they told me to return it
[t] Totally satisfied
##Set up was extremely easy, router firmware has wizards available for all basic settings
speed[@]##Since I replaced my router with this one I have noticed a marked increase in speed
##When using my phone to test wifi speeds, I was getting approximately 3Mb before changing my router and around 10 after, so
##there you go
[t] Died after 2 months use
##I've used D-Link routers for years and this is the 1st dud
##It worked perfectly until this morning
##I woke up and the the lights were dark
##I plugged it into another power supply, still nothing
##I hooked up my old D-Link 615 and worked like a charm
##I guess I just got a bad unit
##It worked beautifully until this morning, no complaints
##But now, I'm out my $70
[t] Satisfactory until it stopped working
##When I first set this router up it was great, pretty straight forward set-up
##At first it provided awesome speed, great range
##However later onwards, connection would cut out and reconnect every so often
streaming[@]##Annoying when you are streaming something
##Eventually the wireless just stopped working
##Although it still worked through hardwire I was unable to see or ping the router meaning it was only acting as a switch
##After ~45minutes on the phone with D-Link technicians, which included being transfered 4-5 times and explaining your situation that many times they were able to deem my router defective
##My router was still covered under warranty so I selected the option they would send me a new router as I send the defective one back
##The only thing that I didn't like is that they made me pay for the shipping on the unit back to them
##Usually electronics companies pay for shipping both ways for defective products
##I still have yet to receive the replacement router
[t] No problems.
##I've had this router for about 2 months now and I've had no problems with it
##It's perfect for my PS3, everything from Netflix to Vudu runs super fast especially in HD
##I definitely recommend this item to anyone
[t] Works Perfectly
##Received very quickly,it works perfectly,very easy to set up
##This is not my first wireless,the others were all "G"
##"N"is a lot faster,and this product works a lot better at longer distances
##I highly recomend it
##Also a salesperson at a local business supply store said he has had no complaints on this exact same model,and everyone who paid more from them,has been very pleased with it
[t] Trouble and more Trouble
##This thing worked terribly for me
##The web interface often did not work
##Had to push stuff over and over
##My VOIP would not work and I could not forward the necessary ports to get it working
##Performance was also sub par
[t] DO NOT BUY. ZERO RANGE!!!
##I Purchase the D-Link Router
##The range drops off in 25 ft! Not only that the blue lights on this thing are SUPER Bright and will drive you nuts
##Trying to stick it out I bought the Antena and guess what
##it did NOTHING
##ZIP-O
##If you buy this piece of crap you will want to return it in a day
##Netgear is much better for reception
[t] 4 months life..
##I have had 3 other D-links before and they all work fine until this unit
speed[@][u]##I wanted to upgrade my  and decided to go with this with so many rave reviews
##And it is exactly what i experienced in the first 3
##5 months
##The router is fast, with only occasional drop connections
##About 2 weeks ago, everything changed
##The router reboot itself every few minutes, I tried all kinds solutions suggested by the customer service, but no help
##Neither Amazon or D-link is offering a RMA for this piece of garbage
##There goes my 100 bucks
[t] Good router for the money
##I now own 2 of these - one at my house and one at a beach condo
##I bought the second one to replace a Belkin router which was continually dropping connections, etc
##I knew this router was reliable since I already owned it
software[@]##The software has been improved since I bought the first one, and makes set-up quick and painless
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##This MODEL# was the 1st router I've ever bought and configured (I've owned 2 versions)
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##This is my first attempt at using a router
installation[@]##I did the installation on my own
##When I ran into a problem with setting up my laptop, D-Link was very quick & patient with helping me complete the setup
##It's working great!
[t] Solid unit
##I would recommend this product to any one that is looking for a extended range unit, with solid performance
##Security features are good, and the customer service is responses - if one needs help with set-up
[t] wireless router
##I ordered and received the wireless router in a timely fashion
##Easy to hook up
##I have been using the router for about 30 days without any problems
##I would recommend to most people that it would be a good purchase!
[t] Wi Fi improved 100%
##My iPhone and iPad2 kept dropping the connection from my old system in the house
##This new D Link wireless router never drops the signal plus I can use it out in the back yard
##Great signal strength
[t] Very strong signal and fast!
##I bought this router for my 3000 sq ft 2 story house to replace a netgear N router
##Setup should have been easy but for some reason it kept saying I had it hooked up incorrectly
##I had to call tech support and they got me through the rest of the setup
##Customer support was very helpful once he understood what was going on
##So far it works great!
[t] Great Product
##Bougth this product as a replacing for DIR-615
##No more bottlenecks,buffering and slowness
security[@]##Also able to use all security features of Network Magic with DIR-655
[t] The best so far
##This was an easy setup
##I did mine in less then 10 minutes and I did one over the phone for my brother
##I also installed Dlink DWA-131 Wireless N Nano USB 2
##0 Adapter 802
##11b/g/n in my laptop that only has "g" capability
##They work great together
##My brother also installed a DWA-131 and is very please with his setup
speed[@][u]##The distance has greatly improve and the  too
speed[@]##I don't know why, but the quality of the signal and speed does vary at times, but this also happened with my older "g" router
[t] Not for highly populated apartment
##Never had an issue with this item at my old apartment - probably was about 5-10 routers in the area
##Once I moved to a large city, the apartment complex I moved into had about 20 routers showing up on my macbook pro
##Every 30-45 minutes I lost connection or the connection would time out
##Adjusted a ton of settings to see if I could get a change (I work in IT so I knowledgeable on what I was changing) but to no avail
##Recommendation
[t] D-Link 655
##Speed and setup are very good
##I did have some issues that tech support helped me resolve on wireless users not getting a DCHP address
[t] Good product
##This Router works well and was easy to setup the wireless and the wired features
price[@][u]##It was in great condition and was worth the 
##I plan to buy more of them as my business grows
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Review
##The transistion from hard-wired to wirless with the D-Link DIR-655 product and setup instructions went flawlessly
speed[@]##I have a two story home and I setup the DIR-655 in a 2nd floor office, but 1st floor receiption and speed are outstanding
[t] Works well for me
##This router is working well for me so far
##Setup process was fairly simple, considering I use Linux on my home computer
##Since the setup, I haven't really paid any attention to it
##It just works
##One reason why I bought this router is the support for 802
##11n
[t] GREAT Product
##Had this about a month now, was easy to set up
##Bought it for my mother who lives behind us in a park model camper
##I didn't think it would reach her through my drywall, pass the metal roof on the deck by the pool, through a metal shed and into her place
##First time I set it up, went out to check it and have 5 bars for strength
##Works great and has worked ever since
##Only bad weather causes me to have to reset from time to time
[t] Six Months in and its no good
##I purchased this unit 6 months ago after reading a great number of positive reviews for the product here on Amazon as well as a few bad reviews
##I thought that the bad ones were over exaggerating or were novices to networking, however trouble managed to hit home
##At first the router worked well and the only problem I noticed was that it was unable to set the correct time, however I thought this a small matter
##A month in and the wireless network went down
##A simple unplug and replug fixed the matter until a month later when it happened again, and again, and again at that point the router was 6 feet away from my computer and I simply connected using an ethernet cable
##Well the time has come to move my computer and the router and the problem is back
##I have tried a number of hard resets, but am relegated to unplugging and plugging the router back in every day in order to establish a connection
##I even purchased a new cable modem thinking that it could be the cause of the problems however it was/is not
##I have emailed D-Link and they gave me standard instructions on problem areas and I have concluded that none of them helped
##It is utterly frustrating in that the computer is 8 feet away in direct sight of the router and is yet unable to establish a connection
[t] Nice Features and Price, If It Worked
##Wow, are there any really good wireless N routers out there? Maybe one but this isn't it
##I researched thoroughly prior to settling on the DIR-655
speed[@]##I was replacing an existing G router because I wanted the higher wireless speed as well as gigabit ethernet
##After spending nearly two hours trying to set this up, I gave up
##It kept assigning conflicting IP addresses or none at all
##I assumed it was defective and ordered a replacement from Amazon
##Amazon of course has great service and overnighted one to me
##Unfortunately, I had the same exact issue with the replacement
##I spent over an hour on the phone both with my ISP (Time Warner) and D-Link
##D-Link's tech support is horrible and basically worthless unless it's something obvious
##So I ended up returning both units and going with a Netgear N-300
##It set up immediately and has worked great so far
[t] SO close to a 5-star
##This is my favorite wireless router that I have ever owned
##I was using a really old Linksys before and it just wasn't cutting it
##Internet signal was in and out and it was just old
##So, I decided to upgrade it
##I went to Besy Buy and saw there was a great sale going on a Belkin wireless router (don't remember model, but it was the Play + version)
##Belkin gave me the route, the box it game in, a broken cat-cable, and two little credit card like cardboard cards with cartoon drawings of the install on it
##Of course, those drawings were not nearly enough to explain how difficult it was to get this route set up
##Once it was, it sucked
##So, I brought it back to Best Buy and came on here and found this gem
internet[@]##Now, my internet was hooked up upstairs in my office
##I need the wireless for my Xbox which is downstairs
##Unfortunately, most wireless is great horizontally, but vertically it can be difficult
antennas[@]##You have to play with the antennas and get the signal strongest
##Where it was at, the Belkin could reach with a weak signal that had to be reset every day
##I could not receive a signal, so it's definately not as strong as the others I have had, which keeps it from the 5-star rating
antennas[@][u]##I moved the position to my bedroom which is directly above the living room and aimed the  down
##It works great and I have a strong and clear signal
##Has never had to be reset and this is going on 2 weeks
##It's also a lot prettier than the others, if that matters to you
##I do plan to cover the lights with electrical tape just because i like a dark bedroom when I sleep and the LEDs are bright
##Overall, this is an easy to set up and efficient little router
price[@]##Great price for what you get and there are attachments available
##Definately consider buying!
[t] Excellent for a while
##I have this unit 13 months today and the wi-fi quit working
##Up until now it was great
##Fast, reliable, etc
##Wired still works
##Status says it is broadcasting, but SSID is nowhere to be found or shows up briefly with 0% strength
##I can see all my neighbors less powerful routers, but not mine
##After troubleshooting myself for several hours then on the phone with tech support for 2-3 hours, decided it was defective
##BUT they will not replace the product since they only have a 1 yr warranty
##I expect more service from my investment
##I will not be replacing it with another Dlink
[t] Printer problem
##Works fine as a wireless router
##However my Brother MFC cannot operate from the included USB connection (turns 1 page into 4 pages)
##In small print D-link tells you that some types of USB connections will fail so I did not pursue further
[t] Easiest set up so far
##after reading the previous reviews I did not bother with the automatic setup
##just went with the manual and worked fine
##PROS After going through 56L 100 MB and now 300 MB routers this was by far the easiest to set up
speed[@]##speed is fine
##CONS Combined with the 141 USB adapter was hoping this would increase my range significantly from the 100 mb router to my notebook
##No dice
antennas[@][u]##Same distance as the old router which only had two 
port[@]##Had to configure a port manually to allow outgoing faxes
[t] Good purchase
##I bought this product to change a linksys router I was using, expecting to improve coverage
##I tried to get better performance changing the linksys antennas, but never could get good results
antennas[@][u]##My expectation was achieved with this D-Link router, without extra 
##Good coverage and easy setup
[t] Good Router
##I have been using this router for about 2 years now, since October 2008
##It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better
speed[@]##Good range & speed
##I highly recommend
[t] A solid router
##Over all this router works very well
##I dont really know much about routers and from what i saw online this was a very well rated router
##We use this router for a PC and a Mac and it works with both very well
##The set up was very easy except I couldnt get the CD to work on the Mac
streaming[@]##I dont notice normal web surfing being any faster but I have noticed that it improved video streaming
##Downloading videos from you tube works great
##All in all I would say it is a good router and worth buying, but it might be a little over priced
[t] 5 stars says it all
##I thought it only fair to review the DIR-655 after giving the DIR-625 such a bad review
##I am not a network engineer or a computer engineer
##However, I am probably more technical than the average homeowner
##My biggest concerns are for range and reliability
##This prodcut is top notch for both
internet[@]##I have not run any bandwidth/throughput tests, but surfing the internet seems fine
##I highly recommend this product
[t] D link
##works like it says it should
##using it for about a month and half no problems
[t] Works Great
##Set up is a little tricker that D-Link routers of the past but over all it went well and works great
[t] Fantastic
##This thing smokes! I set it up in a couple of minutes, connecting 3 devices, an Xbox 360 and 2 laptops
##I replaced a Linksys router
##My Linksys products (2 routers and one print server) all seem to become unstable after 2-3 years, dropping connections, so I'm replacing them with D-Link products
##Hopefully they'll last longer
[t] D-Link Router 655
##I have been using a Belkin Router F5D6230-3 for years hardwired to several computers and a switch
##It seemed to work ok most of the time but would ocasionally drop out and I would have to unplug it to reset, some times twice a day, others every other day
##I recently replaced it with a D-Link DIR 655 which has been operational with out flaw for several weeks now
##It was a fast and easy set up
##If you are having drop out problems try separating the router from the modem
##I read about this and tried it with the old router after I had ordered the new router and the dropouts with the old router ceased
##The new router is faster
[t] d link extreme n wireless router
##I have been using every since i have purchase online through amazon
##I never have any problem and it work great
##Thank you d--link
[t] D-Link Wireless Router
##Easy to setup even for a low tech guy, takes up limited space, works as advertised
##what more do you want than a fully functional wireless router?
[t] D-Link router
##Help line had me set up quickly
##It works great
##I am very happy with the purchase
##I would definitely recommend it
[t] Dir-655
price[@]##this one of the best routers on the market and one of the best router you could could get your hands on for the price
##why i say that is even though it advertise no dead spot which is correct,the link is a little wweak in some spots so what i advise you to do is just get 3 big 10 dbi or 9dbi booster antenae for this whichever one you like and it averages around at about 19 something dollars
##after that you will notice the link connection get better in those spaces where it was usually low
##ant his has something called qos it prioritize things like video so if you are watching a video and you're connected to this router you might notice that it loads up faster than before
##this is one of the main features i love cause with my old wireless router i could not watch 1080p videos and have them load up in like a quarter of the time it took my other one to load the videos
##i have alot of things connected to this like my roku connected to this and when i watched videos on it it would stop to load but not anymore
##i like this alot,but there can be some improvements like why do i have to use shareport and why can only one thing use it
##improve that and it would make alot of people happy
internet[@]##one thing you could do to make this faster and your internet is by not using your isp's dns
##use googles just search google dns setup on google
[t] Dir-655
##I have recommended this router to 5 friends and to anyone who is looking to upgrade routers! This router is a good investment in that it supports gigabit speeds and works as print server
##It is well-designed and easy to use
##It is one of the best routers on the market and has the reviews to support it
installation[@][u]##If you are knowledgeable with router , I would recommend manual 
[t] great
##Good router I was hoping range would be better
antennas[@][u]##Don't get me wrong its good but with all them  I was expecting it to be better
##I did have a little problem hooking it up call customer service they were very helpful and got me fixed up
[t] D-link
##Had a cheaper router and replaced it with this
##The range is twice as good and gives me faster upload and download speeds
##Very satisfied
[t] Quits Working
##I bought one of these and after about 12 months the wireless quit working
##I was pretty happy up until that point and needed another router so I bought another DIR-655
##After 2 months this new one would lose all connection expectantly (like I would expect it in the first place)
##It would "reset" itself and after a few minutes it would lose all connection again
##I'd unplug and plug it back in, which would get me about 5 minutes of connection time before the router would cr4pped out again
##To be fair, I never tried contacting Customer Support to see if they'd "fix" the problem as I need a working connection right now because my son does home schooling
[t] Took a while, but now it works GREAT.
##Initially the router wasn't functioning correctly but after a week it hasn't crashed
##Now it is working perfectly
speed[@]##The look is very sleek and the speed is phenomenal
[t] D-Link DIR-655 doesn't stand up in short range distance tests
##I pitted this D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N router head-to-head against a Belkin router (theBelkin Wireless N+ 802
##11n Router) when my old D-Link 614+ bit the dust
##The Belkin router won out for three reasons
[t] PRODUCT WORSE THAN I CAN EVER EXPECTED AND NO TECH SUPPORT
##I usually don't bother to write reviews on anything purchased from any website
##but this time I am so angry and frustrated about this product and company
##A drand new router for sure is not working
##It need to be rebooted 3-4 times a day to send wifi signals
##I called tech support three times
##no way to fix the prob
##when i ask for a replacement
##They kick me around like a ball
##it is a real pain even just to replace one
##DO NOT EVER BUY DLINK PRODUCTS!
[t] So far so good
streaming[@]##Just received this router to replace my aging Netgear (which I really liked and have had for a long time) but I was having issues with streaming video (Netflix etc
##) and high bandwidth applications
##I figured it was time to upgrade to wireless N and gigabit LAN
##Installation was a breeze and everything was working within 30 minutes
##I also replaced my aging ethernet switch to gigabit (dlink as well)
internet[@]##I am getting excellent performance, even my typical internet surfing is greatly improved
##I am not having the heat issues (the unit being very warm) as mentioned but the blue lights are really bright
##So far, so good
[t] An excellent choice, easy to setup, and the USB SharePort is great!
##It was easy to setup, but you need to know your connection type
##Call your ISP and ask (or Google it), it makes the process easier
software[@]##The included software says connect the modem to the router but connect the computer and the modem at the same time, it makes your job easier
internet[@]##After you're setup and your router doesn't meltdown your internet should be running smoothly
port[@]##Be sure to install SharePort from the CD to make use of your included USB port on the back of the router! (You'll have to install the program on whatever computer you'll want to use the device via SharePort on
##)
[t] N router
##The D-Link Extreme N router is simple to set up with the CD
speed[@]##Works great and has increased the speed on my desktop and laptop
##More importantly, it allows me to use my laptop without bogging down the desktop
[t] D-Link##This has been a very reliable router
##The signal is very strong and I'm able to easily connect from every spot in my house and yard though the router resides at a back room
##I've been running this router for a few months now where a bunch of house guests have connected to it (if I were more paranoid I would be quite alarmed at the number of individuals having the password to my wireless network!) - and never had any issues connecting and maintainig a connection
##This router has so many feature and customization options as well
installation[@]##It is relatively easy to do installation and configuration
security[@][u]##I'm not a network expert but I was able to set both the wire and wireless connections quite easily with the wizards and documentation and even turn wireless  on in no-time
##Connecting to the wireless network with my laptop proved quite painless and simple - even after trying for the first time connecting to a WPA2 secured wireless network with a WiFi enabled smartphone!
[t] OK, but not the expected range
##The unit set up quickly and all worked once I remembered to power cycle my cable modem
##It is fast, but I am not getting the extended wireless range that I had hoped
##I bought the unit because my cable modem sits in an office at one end of the house and we sit wit iPads and laptops in a living room at the other end
##Reception did improve, but is still marginal
##I need to explore relocation the router as much as possible
##What I really need is a repeater, but have been unable to find one that works
[t] Best router ever
##I am writing this review based on my last one year with this router
##I am coming from WRT54g (moded and unmoded firmware) followed by a Sparklan MIMO unit
##And based on my experience, thi sis th ebest router ever
##In last one year, I never have to reboot my router even though it sees over terabytes of data movement every month
##Zillions of connections over bittorent can not slow it down
##It is well made little router
##My only gripe is the USB port, which is good pretty much nothing
[t] Work's great and was easy to install.
##Installation could not have been any easier and it works reliably with no disconnects
speed[@]##I located this in the center of a large home and I get a good download speed now everywhere within the home
speed[@]##I found a central location was critical in maximizing coverage and download speed
##Also, slight changes can make a difference, especially if you are locating it near a wall
##Beware though of D-Link's tech support should you encounter a problem
##Unfortunately you are talking to people who seem to just have the manuals in front of them and not much more knowledge
[t] wish i didn't toss out my old one!
speed[@]##On my old d-link router I had excellent speed (wired desktop, wireless desktop and 5 laptops), but only one of the ports in the back worked - whenever I'd want to swap to xbox or bluray dvd (neither of which I had the wireless option for) I'd have to swap out the cables
##This got annoying - time to upgrade
##Waste of money
##Yes this was easy to set up, even the least technically inclined person wouldn't have an issue setting this thing up
##But on my old router, everything ran at optimal speed, this thing doesn't even let me watch a movie without constant stopping, its finally stopped so long that I pulled up my laptop and started writing this review
##I think i'm going to have to return it
[t] Updated Hardware
##I needed to add wireless access in a screened porch several walls away from the original (18 months old) DIR-655, and at a high angle
##I also needed wired access for a DVR inside the house, near the same location, so I opted for the DIR-655 again
##The new unit looks exactly the same but works even better
speed[@]##I am happy with the old unit, though it seldom connects at the highest speed of 300 mpbs, even when my notebook machine sits within two feet of the router/access point
##The new unit routinely connects at 270 - 300 mbps through an exterior wall and 25 feet from the PC
##I never need to restart the unit due to bugs
##The one time I had to call tech support with a question, I got a very knowledgeable agent who walked me through the situation
##I'm very happy with the product
[t] Excellent Router
##After a long search for a good wireless router i decided to buy the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##I really don't know why there's so much people who "have average knowledge" on hooking up wireless routers and yet they have a hard time hooking this one up
##From the minute I opened it to the minute i finish installing it, it didn't take me more than 10 minutes
##I believe it took me more time removing the old Linksys than setting up this one
##About the random disconnections
##I have experience them but no more that the old Linksys WRT54GL, maybe once or twice from the date i hooked it up
speed[@]##I noticed a slight bump in speed but not a dramatic one, the thing that i love it the range
##I can get signal in places i didn't with the Linksys
##Excellent router, excellent signal strength, fast delivery
##Love it
[t] Dir-655 is junk
##The Dir-655 is junk, I had two DIR-655's and neither was stable
##both would drop the wan connection after a few days requiring a reset of the router
##Stay away from this one
[t] Dlink 655 is a piece of junk
##When I read the reviews for this router I saw a lot of pretty good comments
##What I didn't notice was an equal amount of negative comments
##I believe that dlink is spamming the reviews to keep them positive
##I have had nothing but trouble with this thing
##When I try to stream music or videos it is constantly freezing
##I wish I had bought it local so I could return it with out all the hassle
[t] should never bought this unit
internet[@]##I purchased this unit and spent hours trying to get it to work correctly, the unit says that it is right, but won't connect to the internet
##I have reset this unit more than 10 times, but it won't work
##I have wasted my money
[t] New 'n' type router shouldn't be listed as being compatible.
##This new 802
##11 router is listed as being -a, -b, -g amd -n mode compatible
##It is not
##Toshiba support directed me to D-Link support because my new laptop worked fine on all other modes except the new 'n' mode
##D-Link's best solution was for me to run my new $125 D-Link router in degraded mode, i
##e
##, any one except 'n'
##My old wireless router does that, so I sent it back for a refund
##No more D-Link for me! Mode 'n' is not yet finalized anyway so it's best to wait until the standard has its final parameters to meet
[t] Consider another
speed[@]##The Dlink DIR-655 had no noticeable improvement in range and speed over the old DI-624
##To be fair we are not set up for Extreme N yet
##The DIR-655 quit after one week and after an hour with Dlink support running diagnostics we were instructed to return the router to Amazon as defective
##Try the TRENDnet TEW-633GR instead
##It is easier to set up, seems to be slightly faster and have a greater range, and cost a few dollars less
##We have been using the TRENDnet for three months and haven't had to reboot it yet
##One review wrote that this router is more suitable for DSL, which is what we are currently using
[t] N doesn't work with Vista
##Advertised to work with Vista, but only works wired, or in G mode
##Only G works in Vista-32 or Vista-64
##Technical service gave up after 2 days on the phones with them
[t] Mac support sucks
##I bought it, read the manual, never took the router out of the box, and returned it
##Although this device says it is compatible with Mac OS 10
installation[@]##4, it does not come with a Mac installation CD
##The instructions in the manual didn't make sense and after several calls to tech support (and elevation to tier 2) , I was finally told not to pay any attention to the specific instructions clearly printed in the manual
##When I persisted in asking for help, the tier 2 tekkie got angry and hung up on me
##Sounds like it might be a great router, but I think I'll stick with the Airport Extreme
[t] Very expensive for a blue light/internet bottleneck.
internet[@]##Slowed my internet down
##Went from 10gigs to 5
##5ish
internet[@]##Even slowed my wired internet down
##The eight year old Linksys B this replaced (due to it needing reboots 4x daily) was faster both in wired and wireless forms
##Apparently it's really sensitive to the type of wire it needs
##Lame
##To remedy this I searched for solutions on the appropriate forums and via technical support
##The forums were helpful but made no progress (and I found evidence of others having similar issues)
##The D-Link customer service was just plain unhelpful
##After a few unhelpful suggestions they suggested I sit and wait a while and call back tomorrow
##Right
[t] Wireless stinks let me explain
##I got this last december when a local office store had it on sale for under 100
##It setup well and I was able to do many things with it
##The place I take issue is this when I had it hooked up at our house I found the wireless would go down every 6 days this was a regular occurrence
##Every six days bloop no wireless
##I reset it rolled back firmware it would not work and stay up when I needed it
##I thought at first it was my dsl modem
##So I changed that, I changed settings did not fix it, I even searched the blogs to see if I could find a solution no dice same dealio
##I finally changed my router to an Apple Airport Extreme no issues anymore
##If I need networking I'll go to Cisco, maybe Belkin, or like I did go to Apple
##I will not use Dlink for critical networks ever again! LEt me make this a quick read Stay away from this router, stay away from DLink save your money and get a Cisco, Belkin, or Apple
[t] Powerful enough to cover a room.
##Pros
[t] Gaming must!!
##I did have the Lynksus wireless router that T-Mobile gave us with our land line but I was constantly having firewall problems
##Tried everything
##Tutorials, customer support for every company in the house(Sony, Microsoft, Comcast)
##I got this D Link to fix all the probs I was having with my wireless gaming network
speed[@]##I can and have several times, run my desktop(wired), PS3 (wireless), Xbox 360 (wireless), and laptop (wireless) all at the same time with lightening speed
##That includes both PCs browsing the net and both gaming systems playing online multiplayer
##Def worth the money I paid for it
##Flawless wireless network
##Highly recommend for gamers like me
[t] Was a 4-star until I upgraded to 1.32NA firmware
##My DIR-655 was working great until I upgraded the firmware to version 1
##32NA
##As long as they are not shipping new units with 1
##3x software, it will be a great home router
##If it comes with 1
##3x firmware, it will be slow and require a reboot about every couple of days
##I would like to have a little more flexibility on filtering access
##It only has one website list, so if you have a mixture of age groups, you have to choose the most pressing needs
##You can't block certain sites for one user and then another group of sites for another user
##Before the upgrade it was fast and reliable, though I kept it set for WPA only and not WPA2 because I seemed to have more issues with connectivity on WPA2, especially with Windows PCs
##If they get their firmware fixed, I would change my rating to a 4-star, but this broken firmware that doesn't allow a downgrade is four months old, so who knows how long I will have make regular trips downstairs to reboot the router
[t] I Am Impressed
##I received the router today and setup took about 10min
##However, the setup wizard program on the CD could not complete the setup for some reason so I setup the router manually
##It was actually pretty easy, same as my Belkin wired router which is replaced
##I have a switch which two PCs connect to and then the switch plugs into the wireless router, along with the cable modem
##As soon as the cable modem was up and running again I simply accessed the router via web browser, locked it down and configured it
##The web interface was as expected and has a ton of features which was very nice
##Coverage is great
##The router is upstairs and the coverage downstairs ranges from Excellent to Very Good which is what I was hoping for
##As for running hot, it's been on for three hours now and isn't even warm
##Reviews reporting it "Hot as an Arizona sidewalk in July" must have received a bad router
##The lights aren't as bright as people claim they are
##All-in-all I'm very satisfied as the router performs as expected
##I would recommend this product to a friend
##Tim
[t] D-Link is d-best
speed[@][u]##Allowed my Mac to fly at N  and finally connect after my previous router would not communicate with machine
##Installation was a breeze and in my opinion looks cool on my desk
##The rave reviews here and elsewhere were great and on the money
[t] Drops Out With Mix of "N", "G" modes on Vista, XP sp2
##When it works it is very good
##I have not be able to get my company XP SP2, "G" to connect for any more then 5 minutes
##I loose my Vista Laptops every 6-7 days
##Windows 7 seems ok
##so far
##When I get my newer laptops online they are very fast for a wireless network system
##My older Microsoft "G" wireless router never dropped out
##I will be moving three of the four laptops to windows 7 in hopes this will solve some of the issues
[t] AVOID Until 1.32NA Fixed!
##After 30 days, the DIR-655 could not pick up a WAN address from Comcast
##I started with FW 1
##21 and tried all the downgradeable FW versions before reluctantly upgrading to 1
##32NA
##There's no change
##Dlink support has strung me along for a week now
##"Please reset, reset, reset"
##My PC connects just fine directly to the (dlink) cable router
##An old Belkin G router connects just fine
##(sigh) Looks like I'm gonna have to buy a Linksys
##No more Dlink for me
[t] Plug and play!
##I bought this router after reading reviews from many industry magazines! Everything I read was true, it was as simple as plug and play
##I had to replace my modem and router at the same time
##The cable modem company told me to just install the modem first and then follow the instructions for installing the router! My last router took me almost 6 months to get setup as a secure connection
##This modem was setup with the first installation! It is much faster than any other router I have ever used
##Setup of periphial equipment with the router was just as easy! If you haven't upgraded to N wireless yet - take a serious look at this router!!! Well worth the investment!!
[t] Excellent, time tested performance!
##I made the decision to purchase this specific model router after reading the product reviews here on Amazon
##Not just for the D-Link DIR 655, but also read reviews for other D-Link and competing wireless routers
##At my time of purchase, the DIR 655 had the best reviews on Amazon
##I needed a new wireless router to replace an older router that from time to time could not be "seen" by my notebook computers (using Wi-Fi)
##I have over the years found this to be a fairly common problem with wireless routers
##I was also willing spend the extra dollars for an "N" router
##The router has been in use now for over 6 months
##The verdict
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Wireless Router
##Not really backward compatable for older computers
##Constantly losing connection to router where you need to unplug router and plug it back in again before they sync up
security[@]##Also bought their access point, but it makes my computer lock up due to security blocks on my business computer
##Overall, very frustrating
##Their customer service is out of East India or some place, so you can forget understanding anyone on the phone
[t] No need to use the installation CD, just follow the written instructions and pictures
installation[@]##I did not find the installation CD helpful so just followed the written instructions and pictures instead
##I got the wireless connection set up in a jiff and am now writing this review on the sofa! Speed is equally fast as when it was wired
[t] The newest firmware version 1.31 is a nightmare
##I purchased the router one and a half months ago
##After upgrading the firmware, the router is very unreliable
port[@]##The port forwarding sometimes works and sometimes doesn't
##My KylinTV connection is buffering all the times
##And now it has difficulty to obtain an IP from my ISP, while my computer can obtain one easily when connected directly to the cable modem
##I hope I could return it now
[t] Please do not buy this product or a Dlink product ever again
##Before you think about buying this or another Dlink product, please click on the 1 star reviews or do a search about firmware and DIR 655
##The firmware update will ruin your router, and there is no fix available
##Dlink knows about the issue, yet still leaves the firmware updates on their website for you to update
##Why would anyone do this? I had not updated the firmware on my router since I purchased it, and I decided to update it, because usually with a router, the firmware updates will improve your product
##I did not believe that any harm would come from a simple update
##I've spent the last 12 hours trying every possible combination of attributes available to get this to work, and for the first time in my 15 year career as an Network Engineer for fortune 100 company's, I am defeated by a $150
##00 consumer router
##Right now I am working my way up Dlink's corporation until I am able to speak with Tony Tsao, Dlinks worldwide CEO
##I just want to talk to the leader of a company that does not care about his customers and see what he has to say
##I will never buy another Dlink product again, and unless you want to just throw your money away, you would be wise to follow suit
[t] Stay away from firmware updates
##All firmware updates from v1
port[@]##21 have caused problems with port forwarding, signal loss, and freeze ups
##D-Link has been slow to repsond to the issue
##If you don't believe me, go to the D-Link forums and see what users are saying about it
[t] a very pleased customer
##I'm fairly new to wireless routers and I bought this to replace a Linksys that I have had problems with since I bought it
internet[@]##After talking with my internet provider and researching his recommendationas as well as other routers, I bought this D-Link and couldn't be more happier! The set up took about 10 minutes
##The set up CD has clear and easy to follow instructions
speed[@]##The speed is amazing
##I highly recommend this router to everyone and will
[t] Read this and you're done
##Why am I writing this, my first product review ever, about a router of all things? Simply because I just was amazed that although I reviewed virtually every single one of the 670 reviews of this product (and plenty of others about other routers), at the end of this process my decision to go with the DIR-655 ended up being a (happily successful) leap of faith
##Here's the bottom line
[t] The ONLY Solid/Reliable Draft-n 2.0 Router
##Having tried the Linksys WRT350N and Netgear WNR854T - two competing gigabit etherner/Draft-N routers - I can truly say that the DIR-655 is by far the most reliable, solid device, that performs as advertised IMHO
##It just worked for me
##I miss the promise of USB Disk connectivity from the Linksys, but it never worked properly anyway (huge reliability issues)
##Plus the D-Link has a fantastic adaptive QoS implementation, ensuring my VoIP device works with almost no configuration
##To be fair, the Netgear device had worked fine but died almost exactly 1 year after purchase, with Netgear refusing to help (it was pretty much cheaper to buy a new router) - poor reliability from the Netgear product!Highly recommended compared with Draft-N routers from the competition
[t] Fanastic Router
##This is my very first router and I am so glad that I choose this one
##I have been looking for a router for quite some time and came across this one during a search
##Although it had only 2 reviews I was sold
##The set up was quick and easy and within minutes I have been up and running ever since
[t] helpful device
##1
##Almost intuitive setup;2
##It serves all my laptop wireless cards from oldest to newest ones;3
##It covers three stories family building;4
##It extends my existing network over expectations;5
price[@]##Reasonable price for the valuable service
[t] Great product at a great value if it fills your needs
price[@]##In shopping for a new wireless router, I tried to make sure to only get the product that gave me what I needed/wanted most at the best price and the rest was bonus
##I always read a lot of reviews from many sites before buying something, and being an IT professional, it was easier for me to weed out the bad reviews for products, and at the end, I was left with the choice of the Dlink DIR 655 or Netgear 3500
price[@]##I like everything I am hearing about the new Netgear 3700, but with the price tag, the delayed order status, and the unproven dual-band technology that gets a lot of bad reviews in other products, I had to stick with only what I needed
[t] "....Not the worst router I ever had......"
##Just wanted to share thoughts on my recent experience with the DLink Xtreme-N Gigabit wireless router
##This is the sixth router I have had to deal with at home the past few years, so I have had experience primarily with Netgear and Linksys wireless router products
##Netgear was ok as far as user friendliness for set-up and performance; however, they seem to "burn-out" after 1
##5 to 2 years
##Linksys was more complex to set-up and seem to be prone to dropping connections; therefore, everyday performance was consistently unreliable
##Reason I bought the DLink DIR-655 was because
##1
##Different vendor, different product features,2
##pre-N claims of more powerful and further distance,3
##my research gave me the feeling that DLink had somewhat better performance, support, reliability, and
##4
##their marketing claims were matched by somewhat positive feedback and reviews by consumers
##My experiences
##1
##Typical wireless set-up where I got confused by myriad of optional settings and configurations
##Documentation was ok
##but not easy for a home user to understand
##Give it a "B-" for this initial step
##2
installation[@]##I got the installation to a point and needed to call DLink support
##I must say the support person that helped was perfect
##He spoke good english, had a good sense of humor, and guide me through the remaining installation/configuration process
##Note
[t] Not like to old DIR^%%
##I replaced my old DIR-655 with a new one because I loved it and it lasted a long time
internet[@]##They must have changed the BIOS somehow because the new traffic log function no longer logs all internet traffic
##This one is NOT as good as the one I had 3 years ago!
[t] A pain to work with
##It works fine once you get it installed and set up, but pretty much every screen requires a restart which makes it pain to use
[t] Great product
##Although the antenna connections can be a bit flimsy at times (I mean they can break somewhat easily), it's still a great product with many features and options
##The range is okay, but overall, I have enjoyed it
[t] Excellent!
##I had a netgear router that would constantly knock all my wireless connections offline
##I hate netgear lol
##Found thia beast and i love it
##You will not regret this purchase!
[t] Don't believe the Hype
##Got it, read all this stuff above about it having special way of syncing the data properly
##Signal wasn't that strong at all (they say good for big houses) I'm in a Small House!!!
##Bought a Dual Band (Cool looking Diamond Asus one)
##worth the extra $20 and I'm a cheapsk8
[t] works pretty well. Wish I could set bandwith limitations on ip or mac id though
price[@]##This is a great router for the price
##Good range, good stability
##I just wish you could set bandwidth limitations for specific users
##The qos engine is lacking and automatically will limit your bandwidth on upload and does not allow you to go higher than 500kish
##So I ended up having to disable traffic mapping
##It works for what I need now but will be most likely replaced in the future
[t] Best wireless router I've owned
##I love this router
##I've been using it for over a year with no issues
##The signal is strong throughout our house
##I recently bought an external hard drive and connected it to the USB and now we can back up pictures and other files from several different computers to one external hard drive easily
[t] D-link good job
##I replaced this unit because I had lots of problem with Cisco so far so good I love this product excellent reception very stable set up is so easy
[t] Decent router
##Good value for the money
##Never had the heating issues reported by other reviewers
##But it's is too bright, so I have to turn it away in order to cancel the beam
[t] works for me
##I have tested this product and for my use I get excellent speeds
##When I called customer service for an issue easy to get a hold of someone and they actually seemed to care and trying everything they could to help me
##Great service
##I use this product for wired/wireless and for a phone line with the obi and google voice and all worked great for me with no issues
##I recommended this product to my friends and family as they value my opinion
##I had one friend buy it and one family member buy one
software[@][u]##Now there experience is not what mine is with pcs but both returned the product one said it would not install for them and that they had issues with the  conecting
##The other stated they had one dead spot in there kitchen where they hadnt before with old equipment
installation[@]##I tried walking them through installation over the phone and recommending technical suuport, but unfortunatly they did return item
##I used vista 64 bit and windows 7 64 bit and have had no issues
##my review is 5 stars because in my experience the item perfromed as described and has worked without issue for my needs as stated are many
##However I provide the others experience as food for thought
##Thank you for your time I definitly recommend to try for yourself as not everyoes experience will be yours
[t] Fast Ethernet, Poor Wireless Transmission
##I had a mixed experience with this router
##This is the fourth router I've tried in the past few months and this one comes in 3rd place
##My first place choice, is my old D-link DI-524 router, at least in terms of the wireless capability
##Even though it was an older wireless G router, the signal strength was better than any of the new N routers I've tried, and my Skype video sessions were rock solid
##Unfortunately, despite having a surge protector on it, a recent power outage killed it
##My second place choice, and the router I ended up keeping is the TP-Link TL-WR1043ND, which was the cheapest of the N routers I tried, with gigabit ethernet and the best reception/range of the N routers
##Third is this D-Link router, which I'll summarize below
##The fourth was a Netgear Rangemax WNDR 3700, which I reviewed back in January; awful setup, terrible range, completely different experience than some of the reviewers
##As for this router, here is what I found
[t] Frequently Reboots
software[@]##The software on the router is pretty good
##It's easy to use, and it seems feature complete
##Way more features than I'll ever use, but nice to know they're there if I ever want to twiddle
##I'd like to give it 4 or 5 stars
##The problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour, if not more frequently
##This is my experience, and it seems to be a common one
##It is infuriating, frustrating, and disruptive to my workflow
##It takes approximately 20 to 90 seconds to come back online (I haven't timed it), which doesn't sound that bad until you get nailed 10 times in one hour (that's about as bad as it gets; sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting)
##According to various forums, lots of people have this problem (just google "dir-655 rebooting"), and there doesn't seem to be a consensus on a solution
##The solutions that worked seemed to involve black magic or pure luck, as they would work for one person would not work for another
##Most people reported continued problems, even after getting a replacement from DLink
##Yes, I have the newest firmware (I've even reflashed it several times, just in case)
##I'm running a minimal configuration, nothing fancy beyond password protecting the wireless
##This happens when my laptop is the only computer on its network
##I have not contacted DLink
##For now, I've propped it up on its side to increase ventilation (one of hotly contested but ultimately unverified rumors is that the reboots are heat related)
##We'll see how it goes
##Next, I'll call Comcast and see if they have any insight
##(Wireshark shows what seems to me to be an excessive amount of ARP requests
##Could that be it? I'm not a networking expert by any means)
##I recommend buying another product until this long running issue (I've seen posts from 2007) is resolved
##Update Jan 2013
[t] The best Wireless-N for the money.
##I have a split-level house and due to the way the house is wired, the Internet Connection is in the Office in my basement
##I had an Apple Airport Extreme Wireless N Base Station
##I was plagued by bad reception - 3 Bars upstairs, 2 bars sometimes, and numerous dropped skype calls, and network issues
##My NAS was wired directly to the router - when I was downstairs, I would get moderate performance and upstairs, when I right-clicked an ISO image to mount, the network would take for ever, at 36 Mbps and on a good day, around 74
##Just wired up the DIR-655, and guess what, a consistent 130 Mbps throught the house
##Amazing - 5 bars upstairs
speed[@][u]##I right click and mount ISOs and the  is decent
software[@]##I dont have to install the Apple Airport Express software anymore
##I even tried using an additional Apple Airport Express unit to see if that would make things better - no go
##Doesnt make a difference
##Here's what I think - for an apartment under 2000 Square feet where the most you have between the router and a client PC is one wall, yeah, the Apple Products work
##Non-Mac PC's still connect only at the 2
##4 GHz and not the 5GHz as advertised
##And there's no way on the AEBS to disable one or the other
##So the router's not going to work great unless you have Apple hardware
##The Dell Laptops - mine and my wife's, just love the D-Link
##It has been 2 days, and I think that my days of bad wireless performance are behind me
##Remember, as frequency increases, range decreases
##The D-Link DIR-655 operates at 2
##4 GHz
##Yeah not great frequency, but great range and it works great for me
##GREAT
##Nothing less
speed[@]##The greatest thing here is that the AEBS gave me very inconsistent performance - the speed fluctuated constantly, for no reason
##I would be sitting there typing just as I am right now and it would go to single digit Mbps speeds
##With the DIR-655, I have 5 bars and 130Mbps - consistent
##Too cold to go out onto the deck yet, but I will this summer, and I have a feeling this thing is going to rock
[t] Work great for a short while
##Do your homework before purchasing this router
##It is plagued by firmware issues since day one
##I cannot connect both g and n it is an either or
##I currently have a bricked DIR-655 due to a firmware update
##Search the web for DIR-655 firmware issues
##Do Not Buy This Router
##You are better off with an engenius product or and seperate wired router with an wireless accesspoint connected to that
[t] Garbage.
##Roommate bought this to solve our torrenting problems after my several years old WRT54G, which worked flawlessly, died
##My main gripe about this router is that the QoS feature is absolutely horrible
##Both my roommate and I have spent hours trying to configure it to work
##We tried ticking and unticking boxes, playing with upload levels, trying different priority settings, but nothing works
internet[@]##My old router flashed with DD-WRT, you could upload and download at max speed, browse the internet and play L4D2 with perfect ping
##The DIR655 is just one giant headache and a hassle
##I would return it if it were my router
##Luckily I'm getting a new router tomorrow which I will flash with DDWRT and tell my roommate to take this piece of junk back
[t] Top notch router - great bang for your bucks
##Having owned multiple D-Link DI-624's and wirless access cards; gave them all to family members who needed wifi
speed[@]##I did test out and compare this to a Linksys WRT610N, but won't post the speed tests
##Others have already done so
##Linksys has the edge in raw speed, but I found this D-Link DIR-655 to be a better value, and easier to use
##It's also less power hungry than the Linksys
##My unit is h/w version A4, and runs cool to the touch under load
##I have it wall mounted in my basement, but have no dead spots throughout my house
##Green technology powers down ethernet ports when not in use
##You can configure wireless to power down on a schedule too
##I didn't need the included CD to set this up at all
##CD and website include a pdf manual - but we never RTFM!Set up static ip for my wifi HP printer
##Gave my Ooma voip hub preferential treatment in QoS
##Set up a workgroup so my DirecTV dvr can access the Public folder on my computers, and my NAS drive
##Set up a separate guest wifi for visitors so they could access the Net, but not my protected network nor storage drive
##Pros
[t] Great new router!
##I just replaced my Linksys WCG200 (Cable Modem and Wirelss G Router in one) with a new modem and the DIR-655 router
##I have to say the Linksys performed very well with one issue
##It dropped wireless connections when more than one wireless PC was in use
##We worked around that by daisy chaining a second router that I had
internet[@]##I use the internet daily for business so its somewhat of a leap of faith to replace working equipment just in hopes to get something a little faster
##After some reseach including reviews on Amazom I bought a new Motorola SB6120 modem and the DIR-655 Wireless N
##After my phone call to my cable company and successfull install of the modem, I started on the router install
##I think that took all of 5 mninutes to have it set up with security, it just couldn't be easier
##I followed the instructions, starting with the big orange label that said remove protective plastic film before starting
##Plugged the CD in, hit next a couple times, selected WEP security, it generated a key, gave me a choice of using that random key or one you enter, I chose the random key and had a laptop connected in no time
##Plugged in my network storage and another wired connection and was done
##I definitly got what I wanted, it is faster although some of this will be attributed to my new modem as well
##I also hooked up a D-Link Internet Camera
##This is the type with its own IP address
port[@][u]##I set up  forwarding with D-Link phone sup and had the Camera working as well
##This would have been easy had I simply know what the camera needed
##So far with 2 laptops both held their connections with no problem
##The signal strength seemed weaker than the old router, however the connection is faster/better overall
##I read another review that said the SB6120 and IDR-655 didn't play well together
##well they do
##However anyone may experience differences due to the many variables
##Another review said the unit got hot, he replaced it thinking he had a bad one, and the replacement also got hot after a couple hours of use
##Mine has been on for 30 hours straight and its barely luke warm, it does not feel above room temp
##So far
##this is a great router
##I'll add another review after a few months
[t] Nice capabilities but currently buggy
##The DIR-655 has a number of important features including the ability to configure QoS
##Overall, the feature set is rather impressive and the device speedy
##However, the latest firmware updates have left a large number of users quite unhappy
##Stability issues have arisen in the latest firmware releases that dlink seems either unable or unwilling to fix
##Though a number of stability issues can be seen as reported by others online, my particular problem has been with lock-ups
##Every 3-4 days the device will lock up and I will loose all wireless signal
##I cannot even communicate with the router itself at this point
##The only way to remedy the problem is to power cycle the device, at which point everything will again work fine for a couple of days
##This only started occurring with release of the 1
##3x firmware
##Prior to this my device had no issues
##Unfortunately, starting with 1
##31, you can not go back to previous firmware versions
##If you purchase a router and it has a firmware prior to 1
##3x, DO NOT UPGRADE to the latest
##Reports of lock-up errors have been posted on Dlinks message boards since May but the issue has not been fixed
##Overall, the features on the device are quite nice and prior to upgrading to the 1
##31 firmware, I was quite happy
##However, after having to power cycle the device about once every 3 days for the last 3 months I am beginning to feel a bit sour on Dlink as a company
##Prior to this, I have used primarily dlink products for all my home networking for about the last 9 years
[t] DIR 655
##The DIR 655 is a poor router since the 1
##31 firmware upgrade
##The router now locks up once a week
##D-Link support stated that it was a problem if the router locked up more than once a day
[t] Works well after arduous setup
##I'm writing this on behalf of a friend for whom I set up this router
##He bought it to replace a DIR-628 that was dead from the start - wouldn't even boot
##He was unable to find a replacement when he went back to the store with a return authorization, which made me suspect the manufacturer probably had a run of defectives, so I recommended he switch to another model
##Although this unit is now functioning properly, it emphatically did NOT do so right out of the box - at least not if you have AT&T; DSL
##And neither tech support from AT&T; nor D-Link was able to solve the problem
##The former stated that since it wasn't their product, my friend would have to pay for anything past the most basic help
##The latter was more knowledgeable about the router (of course), but not about its interaction with the AT&T-supplied; modem
##And I still have trouble understanding those Indian accents
##First, the router
internet[@]##It comes default-set to a cable internet connection
##It's very possible that, if that's what you have, it WILL connect you right up
##However, I eventually discovered that when you switch to PPPoE mode for DSL, and choose Dynamic IP address (which is required for AT&T;), the DNS server entries are NOT zeroed out as they should be
##Instead, they specified the ROUTER's IP address, which I believe prevented dynamic mode from functioning properly
##I discovered this by comparing the configuration of a properly-functioning D-Link WBR-2310, which was successfully connected to AT&T
internet[@]##; Once I went in manually and cleared those entries, I finally had internet access
##As a side-note, it seemed that when I changed the connection mode from the default "on demand" to "always on," it functioned faster, presumably because it didn't have to "wake up" after a period of inactivity
##Regarding the modem, AT&T; (at least in the SF Bay Area in CA) provides a Siemons Speedstream 4100 DSL modem
internet[@]##When this modem is connected directly to a computer's network port, its "INTERNET" light confirms internet connection
##However, what D-Link's tech support did not know - presumably because it isn't THEIR product - was that this feature does NOT function through a DIR-655 router (or a WBR-2310, for that matter)
internet[@]##But that does NOT necessarily mean there is no internet connection present; it just means you can no longer confirm its presence via the modem light
##Lack of this knowledge led my D-Link support agent down a primrose path for quite awhile
internet[@],security[@][u]##Once I got internet connection, setting up wireless access was trouble-free, and the laptop I brought with me was quickly able to log on with the  key my friend chose
##In sum, I have no reason to believe that this unit won't have the reliability and longevity that I've seen with other D-Link routers
##It's very likely, though, that many folks who have given up in disgust and returned these things, could have had them working if D-Link's support staff had a more comprehensive knowledge base
##I can't be the first one to have traveled this road
[t] Excellent wired, but wireless keeping going dead.
##I have owned two DIR-655
##The first one (HW RevA) worked perfectly, great range, and stable and fast connection
internet[@]##When I changed my internet service provider, and it came with a wireless cable modem, I happily sent the DIR-655 to parent's house and set them up for a stable wireless coverage
##After a while, as I found the wireless router in the cable modem is not as good as my old DIR655, I bought my second DIR655 (HW RevB)
##It performs as well as the first when it does work, but the wireless part will die at least once a day
##When the wireless dies, it really dies
##You can't find its SSID anywhere and requires a power recycle to bring it back up
##It is really annoying
[t] Better internets
##Works great
##Lots of features QoS, mac/ip filtering ect ect
##It took a while to set up (~1 hour) and I am a pretty good tech wiz
##But, it was worth it
[t] great range for the money
##This D-Link router is great
##It has a great range
[t] New add on
price[@]##This router exceeds expectations for me my first on is three years old and never had a problem with it, so when I saw this new one advertised at half price I bought another one this should last me for a long time
price[@]##Great product for the price
[t] Works as Expected
##Yep it works, good signal, have yet to DDWRT it but I will at some point
##20 words its a wireless router and its speeds are sufficient for my needs
[t] Disaster
##I'm now sending back my second router for a third, shipping at my expense and going without a router for several days each time
##I've spent hours and hours on the phone with D-Link support, which is really good
##Too bad the hardware is pure junk!Also had many issues getting the wireless to work with my macbook and Ipad
##Buy anything else but this router!!
[t] Perfect Router
##I have gone through 5 very expensive routers and found the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router to out perform them all hands down
installation[@]##I have a shed 80' from this router where I work from and it gives me a very quick link up every time, all day long without any interference or my being dropped as I was prior to this installation
##Along with my Asus Omni Antenna (WL-ANT-191) I have had -0- problems with my reception
##And you cannot beat the price, a really affordable unit that puts out like no other can and I have had five of the best prior to this that failed me miserably where this unit has over exceeded my expectations of it
##Touche&#34; D-Link
[t] CCTV Security Camera's DVR and port forwarding problems
port[@]##I should of listened to the reviews about getting the port forwarding to work on this D-Link D-655
##I gave up after 3 days of fooling with this D-655 and went back to my Linksys and I was up and running in 10 minutes
port[@]##For some reason when I opened a port to allow access to my DVR Security cameras so I could use my iPhone or laptop to log into my DVR it wouldn't work
##I could only log into my DVR within my internal network(LAN)
internet[@]##I do have a static IP, I could not get the D-655 to see my DVR over the internet at all no matter what I did
##I tried everything, I had a knowledgeable Tech try and I called D-Link tech support, Called my ISP tech support and all attempts failed
port[@][u]##If you're NOT doing  forwarding then this router might work ok for you! I'm sending it back for a refund!
[t] D-Link DIR - 655 Extreme - N Router
##I'm very satisfied with this product
##Easy to install and great coverage
security[@]##Good security
##I would definetly recommend to anyone looking for a good router
[t] Very good router
##Best router I've owned
##Gives me a little more range than other routers I have used
##If you're debating over this one and the medialink router go with the D-Link
[t] Great Router, Vonage Faxing Issues
##This router is wonderful for wireless and wired connectivity
##Fast, stable and very configurable, almost too configurable in some ways
speed[@]##It was so much faster than my previous router using the same network cables and cable modem, over 2000Kbps faster according to DSLreports speed tests
##I was able to make it do everything I wanted to except send faxes using my Vonage phone service
##Even the phone calls were fine, but did have a noticeable hissing sometimes
##Now before you dismiss this as a Vonage problem and not that router, I plugged back in my old Microsoft Broadband Networking Wireless Base Station | MN-700 and the faxing once again works with no issues
##For some reason this new router puts too much line noise for any faxes to work, even after dropping the speed, turning off error correction and many other things
##A great router overall, with one glaring problem that made me completely unable to use it
##4 stars, would be 5 if the Vonage service worked fully
[t] Very Good Router for the Advanced User
##I recently had a negative experience with another product; so I did some research, and the DLink DIR-655 Wireless Router had generally good reviews
##The basic install wizard is simple and straight forward, and gets you up and running quickly
##The router has a broad array of advanced features
##However, getting to these advanced features is more difficult than it should be due to the poorly designed configuration interface
##The poor interface is a shame, I suspect many of the negative reviews are due to the difficulty in configuring this feature rich product
##The user interface is why I did not give this product 5 stars
##I would recommend this product, but with the reservation that novice computer users should be aware of the difficulty in configuring advanced features
##UPDATE
[t] Very poor support !!!!!!
##The product is good and does what it was intended to do, but I am rating the product a 3 star mainly because of it's very poor support out of India
##I needed to talk with support twice and got two different answers for the same problem and both answers were wrong
##I finally had to get someone locately to get my D-Link up and running the way it was intended
##Again extremely poor support so be forwarned!!!
[t] MUCH MUCH Better than Linksys
##Have used the Linksys WRTG54S and several Linksys expanders to cover my 2 story home
security[@]##The whole linksys security deal with the expanders is a nightmare
##I plugged the D-Link in and it absoulutely covered all the area that the Linksys did and then some - straight out of the box
speed[@]##The speed is amazing
##In my market Charter offers 20 meg down and 2 meg up - the DLink handles it effortlessly
##I have run Skype/Messenger/NetFlix movies simultaneously
##I can't imagine using any other product again
[t] It works - but no extra distance and not worth the upgrade
##Upgrade is all hype
##I upgraded from my 5 year old Linksys WRT54 G router, since the wireless didn't reach the upstairs back two bedrooms
##I bought the router and upgraded the laptop with a dual bank N card
##All I needed was 8 feet additional distance, but discovered this router didn't help at all
##Back to the store and back to my old reliable 5 year old router
[t] Great Router with Great Price
##This is an excellent router
##I have noticed a huge jump in my bandwidth since I upgraded to this router from my Netgear WPN 824v2 junk
##This router is stylish and built solid
##I must admit that I have not done a full test on it yet ;(including range), but I have been using it heavily since it came in and it's performance is rock solid
##I recommend this router
[t] Adequate machine.
##I found the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N wireless router adequate for my needs
##I found nothing to complain about
##Handles my 15Mb connection just fine
##Internal networks between wireless-N vista machines and wired gigabit connected servers performed just fine
##Server to server 1000Mbps is running many times faster than my previous 100Mbps connections
##The wireless N runs much faster than my 54Mbps
##5 stars for a good unit with plenty of futures and nothing to complain about
[t] Great product, but...
##It is important to remember that if you have a slower device (e
##g
##, 802
##11b) it slows down the whole network
[t] Werks Gud
##No problems, easy install, also has a Guest wireless network which is nice for when you have folks over
[t] Customer Service
internet[@]##Network set up is a breeze! However, I have an Actiontec DSL modem and the router wouldn't pick up the internet connection
##It's a common problem, but power cycling and reconfiguring didn't work
##I ended up calling D-Links tech support and they helped immediately
##My modem and router had the same IP address, so I manually changed the router's IP and problem solved
software[@],port[@]##Also the USB sharepoint software is nice, but only one person on the network can use the USB port at a time
##We hooked up an external hard drive, but it isn't a true NAS (network attached storage) in reality, since only one person can use it at a time
##It is still very nice though, since we don't have to move the external hard drive from computer to computer any more
##Plus a real NAS can be expensive
##For that reason, I'll give the D-Link points
##The downside that I can see in the future is when I want to connect a network music player and have it use the FLAC music files on my external hard drive as the music source
##Maybe it will work and maybe it won't; time will tell
##The "N" network is REALLY nice and is just about as fast as an Ethernet cable
##Plus, we were able to configure the router with the more advanced WPA protection, which made our old wireless modem look like a dinosaur in comparison
##I would recommend this router if you are comfortable doing a little troubleshooting and/or have the patience to use an automated calling center until you can actually talk to a service representative
[t] Wireless Router - D-Link DIR-655
security[@],speed[@]##My Linksys router died on me and I needed a new wireless router with the latest generation in improved transmission speed and security for in-house network
##This router has so far proved to be flawless
##Easy setup and customer support is excellent
##I will buy from this company again
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##The router works fine once you get it set up
##I haven't had a great of experience in setting up wireless networks and I had some difficulty getting this one up and working
##But, overall, I'm quite satisfied with it
##A lot faster than my old network
[t] Range on this router sucks
##I replaced my Belkin pre-N with this router, it was easy to set up and throughput is terrific
##BUT the wireless range is terrible! With my Belkin pre-n I could go to the end of my driveway, which is over 300' before I lost signal, in my house I always had full bars
##When I replaced it with the dlink I could not get a signal in the far end of my house where the bedroom is, plus my iphone could not connect even on the deck! I resolved the issue by installing my old Belkin pre-n as a access point and now I have the best of both, good throughput with the dlink and great wireless with the Belkin!! Now only if I had both in one unit
[t] Compatible with Vista and Clear (WiMax) ISP
##I had purchased a relatively inexpensive dual band router from MicroCenter on sale for $39, originally $59
##I figured I was getting a good deal, but a couple minutes after it was set up, I realized that, for whatever reason, the Netgear router didn't play well with Vista and / or my new WiMax ISP, Clear
##It would cut out and try to reconnect every fifteen minutes or so
##I returned it and asked a couple friends what to get
##They recommended this model
##While it's expensive, you're getting something that works great with everything
##Sometimes, it's worth the extra coin to get something that's just going to work, and work flawlessly
##I have connected TiVo on WiFi, Roku, and a lappy in addition to my desktop
[t] Works Great!
##This router is very simple to set up and fast
##I have it set up for mixed mode, both "G" and "N" and the throughput on the "N" laptop is almost as fast as when I have the router set to "N" only
##The "G" throughput on my other "G" laptops is about the same as my old Linksys router
##Well worth the money
[t] Increased SPEEED
##I had the DIR-624 G router from DLink
speed[@]##Went with the upgrade to see what would happen to my speed
internet[@]##Just on internet speed, it jumped up a solid 50%
##Definately worth the $$
##Also, I have my external HD plugged in there now with all of my music loaded and linked through my iTunes
internet[@]##I havent tested how much faster things are across my networked computers, but if the internet is 50% fast, I'm good
##[
##]
[t] Best D-Link Router I've Purchased
##I've been buying D-link routers for years because they are very reliable
security[@]##Sometimes I've had a little trouble with the setup, but with this DIR-655, I put in the disc, and it was quick and easy to get access all over the house--with password security
##When putting in the wizard CD, I thought, pull up a chair, this will take a while, get the PDF manual ready, but in about 15 minutes, I was up and surfing! Nice! Didn't even need the manual
##I have it in a closet downstairs
##Upstairs receives a "Good" signal through a lot of walls
##That's the way these things should work
##Several laptops at one time can surf around with no problems
##I don't mind the bright blue blinking lights because it's in a closet
##When I open the closet door, it kind of looks like a high-tech command center
##I can see this becoming an issue for others
[t] A great router
##I purchased this router as an alternative to my aging 802
##11g router by Zyxel
speed[@]##My old router had served me well but was limiting my broadband speed in ways I hadn't realized until I switched to cable broadband
internet[@]##The D-Link router is great!! I get much higher throughput from direct internet connection through the router for my desktop machine as well as very speedy wireless connection on my notebook
##It is easy to configure and has not caused me any troubles
##I am currently running firmware 1
##21 without incident
##I highly recommend this router if you don't need the latest dual band capability
##I tried one of those (a D-Link 825 if I can recall correctly) but took it back as it was overkill-- a features set I wasn't going to use, too hard to configure properly, and more expensive than the 655
[t] Fast!
##I like it
speed[@]##It makes a world of difference in speed with WIRED systems and wireless
speed[@]##It is a night and day difference from my old Netgear wireless G router in terms of speed and wireless strength
##my laptop gets full strength wireless regardless of where in the house I am, where the older G router would struggle at times
streaming[@]##No longer does my web surfing get ground into the dirt when I'm streaming a movie or downloading a large file
##Worth every penny
##Two downsides
[t] Easy
##I just bought my first laptop and did a lot of research to select a router
##This one seems to fit the bill for a firstimer, easy to setup and so far runs great
[t] Fast Router & Easy to Configure
##Very fast router, great performance
##The setup was very easy and the SW package that comes with it is very useful
##It takes the complexity out of windows and home networking and allows you to check status of the network, share folders & printers, configure the router and a host of other features
##Great router and one of the easiest I have ever configured
[t] Router is fast and functional
##I was able to set the router up quickly, and I found the router to be much more configurable than my previous D-Link router
##I love it!
[t] Buyer Beware - different/ vague claims from D-Link
##I just bought this router
##I thought once I see the capability I will add more 802
##11 n hardware
##Right now I only have 802
##11g devices
##The manual claims two different wireless speeds
##I had to spend half hour with support trying to find out which one is correct
speed[@]##Here is what the features section says RE wireless speed
[t] Don't count on 802.11n support, sporadic disconnects overall
##I bought this as an upgrade from my d-link DI-524 router, because I needed something more dependable for wireless, and something with a better signal (and performance)
##Overall, I have zero improvement from my last router, and its just as undependable, if not more
##There are some improvements in the interface, but not worth the $125+ you'll spend
##CONS
[t] Drops WIRED Connections at Least Once an Hour
##The DIR-655 dropped WIRED connections at least once an hour and the wireless is off more than it is on
##You would expect any router to be able to permanently keep a wired connection up without any configuration
##After some weeks of trying various versions of the bios and all kinds of tips I found online, I finally gave up and bought the $32 Belkin-G wireless
##The Belkin also drops the wireless connection now and then, although not nearly as often
##The great news is that the Belkin has yet to drop a wired connection no matter how long I am on or how much I download
##Configuration was easier with the Belkin, too, especially the wireless password
##It allows you to use a normal pass-phrase as an alternate to the long hex string
##This makes it so much easier to add your computers to the wireless network
##If the d-link supported this, I never figured out how to do it
##I wish I had not debugged for so long as it is now too late to return it
##If you can't get it working in a few days, send it back because it never will work
[t] Watch the auto-negotiation
##I really, really wanted to like the DIR-655
##It had most every feature I wanted (though dual-band N would have been nice - one needs the much more expensive 855 for that)
##Unfortunately, I just could not get it to work
##The problem is that it would not acquire an IP address by DHCP from my ISP, Verizon FiOS
##Using the same MAC address didn't help, neither did making sure the IP was released from the old router before connecting the new one
##I had an old Netgear router around and it got an IP immediately, as did my notebook when I connected it directly
##I returned the DIR-655 and got a second unit - same exact problem
##D-Link support was polite and tried to help, but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful
##A web search revealed that this model has a history of DHCP IP acquisition problems, though not everyone sees it
##I read reports of a European firmware update that resolved the problem for some, but it didn't for me
##I've never encountered a router problem like this before, and have had probably six or seven over the years
##Sadly, I returned the 655 for a refund and will keep looking
##I know that many are very happy with this product, even those using Verizon FiOS, but just be aware that you may be as unlucky as I was
##Edit
[t] DO NOT BUY THE ROUTER OR ANY D-LINK PRODUCT
##I am going to keep this short because I do not want to waste any more time on anything relating to DLINK, So I am only going to discuss why you should not buy this router or any DLINK product
##About a year ago I purchased this D-Link DIR-655 router when I upgraded to a MB that supports Gigabyte
internet[@]##Within a short period of time, I had an issue with internet connectivity
##I rebooted the router and all was well
internet[@]##until the next time I had an issue with internet connectivity
##I did some poking around and found that it was a DNS server issue
##I subsequently disabled DLINK's advanced DNS service and all was well
internet[@]##until the next time I had an issue with internet connectivity
##At that point I switched to a third party DNS (google)
##All was well
internet[@]##until the next time I had an issue with internet connectivity
##So I upgraded the device firmware and all was well
internet[@]##until the next time I had an issue with internet connectivity
##So I went back to my old DLINK DIR-624 and all was well, and all continued to be well
##And continued to be well and continued to be well
##So I figured maybe my DIR 655 that I ordered from Amazon had something jostled loose in shipping
##So I went to a local store and bought another DIR 655, and all was well
internet[@]##until the next time I had an issue with internet connectivity
##So I called their tech support, which is overseas and on a terrible VOIP connection
##The level one technician is an information collector
##When he got to his 10th question
[t] Wireless connection keeps dropping
##The wireless connection drops every day until I reboot the router
##Forcing the use of a fixed channel didn't help
##On the bright side, the wired connection works fine and the configuration options are pretty clean and extensive
[t] Can I Leave Zero Stars?
##Wow, what an awful router
##I'm no stranger to computer hardware and I've tried every (poorly documented and ill conceived) solution typical to wireless router as well as those specifically recommended by D-Link
##From firmware, configurations, channels, different ISPs, different physical locations in the house as well as multiple residences
##The results are the same
##bad or worse
##D-Link's Dir-655 short-bus offering stutters along with anemic speeds, frequent disconnects and all around wretched performance
##I can safely say that the old WRT-54G sitting in my trunk of tech, outperforms the D-Link Dir-655
##Honestly, they should have called it the F-Link Duh-655
##Do not, under any circumstance waste a penny on this router
##You could not GIVE me one for FREE, and I wouldn't wish this router on my worst enemy
##Lesson learned, stay away from D-Link, they have no business being in the router industry
[t] Bad quality
internet[@]##Just like alot of other reviewers on this site I also keep getting internet downtime
##Tired of messing with firmware updates and redoing stepups, going to buy another brand router
[t] WORST DEVICE ON EARTH!!
##I have had 4
port[@][u]##That right FOUR of these POS routers sent to me and they always die from simply changing a simple option in  forwarding
##They are the most buggy, unreliable and overpriced devices and I will never in my entire life buy another D'Link product
##I will also actively discourage anyone that will listen from going D'Link for absolutely anything
##If you want a good router then buy a Linksys model since they are owned by Cisco, cheaper, more reliable and the customer support is worlds better than D'Link
##If you can't get a Linksys then buy a Netgear
##PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BUY YOURSELF THIS HEADACHE!!!
[t] Only Lasted 3 Years
##Can't stand it when you spend almost a hundred bucks on a tool (that's basically what routers are), and it suddenly stops working within 3 years
##While it worked, it was fine
speed[@]##Range and speed were fine
##Never had any issues
##But then just after the 3-year mark, it died
##Not sure if other wireless routers last any longer though as our previous one was a Linksys, and it died after about 3 years as well
speed[@]##So, the new strategy I'm going to test is to buy a cheap one (decent speed but cheap), and see if it makes it to 3 years
[t] Nothing Special - Port Fowarding Bugs in Firmware
internet[@]##This unit was a lackluster performer on our network and refused to forward the proper ports for our live webcams on the internet
##The firware is average and hasn't been updated in a very long time
##D-Link is no longer supporting this product with firmware updates, so based on the above mentioned issues and the lack of future firmware updates to fix some obvious bugs, I can't recommend this product
##It did perform better than some of the other losers in our quest to find a quality N router, but that isn't saying much! ;o)We finally found the router we had been searching for in theNetgear N900 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router (WNDR4500)
port[@][u]##I should mention that the live webcams that this device refused to properly forward s for, work perfectly with the 4500 using the identical  forwarding settings, so when I say that there is a BUG in this devices firmware regarding  forwarding, I know what I am talking about
##The NetGear 4500 is seriously worth your consideration
price[@]##I know it is nearly triple the price of this D-Link model, but you do get what you pay for, and the 4500 is worth every penny if you value your personal time and your sanity! It also puts out such a strong signal that you might not even need a repeater for your current dead spots!Don't waste your time and money on the DIR-655
##Its days are numbered and you can do better!I see that a few people didn't find this review helpful? Huh? Can't handle an honest review from someone that managed networks professionally? Whatever
##You've been warned, so I guess you can say that you deserve the subpar performance you will get from this thing, and forget about forwarding any ports to the internet, cause the firmware is definitely bugged in that regard
##;o)
[t] Ridiculous...does not do as advertised
##I have decided that the best way to solve this issue is to stop people from making the same mistake as me
##If you were hoping to use the "share port" feature to set up a wireless print server or wireless external hardrive DO NOT BUY
##The Share Port program does not work and in over 2 years, dlink has still not corrected the problem
##Not only that, but dlink refuses to admit the problem is their firmware and rectify it with customers
##Don't believe me? sift through these two forums and 20 pages of issues reporting the same problem
##[

##]
[t] Poorly Made Product - Terrible Support
##THIS IS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT and D-LINK's TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS EVEN WORSE (HARD TO BELIEVE)!!! Many companies are concerned about the customer, but this one is not
antennas[@][u]##In my case, a connector for one of the three  just came off one day (poor quality)
##I had owned the product less than two months
##I tried to return it to get it repaired and the Technical support people at D-Link said it was not covered
##I went back to the system I had used prior to purchasing this product (D-LINKS ROUTER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BETTER), and the old LINK SYS system worked 100 times better than this one
##DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY!!!! Go with LInk SYS
##I WILL BE RETURNING THIS TO AMAZON TODAY FOR A PARTIAL REFUND

[t] great value if the router was reliable
##I bought this router to upgrade from an older DI-624 wireless g router
speed[@]##From the description, it had all of the features I wanted, and I was excited to get the speed and range boost associated with upgrading to n
##Setup was easy enough, although the GUI is poorly designed
##I had my network up and running almost as fast as I could unpack this unit
##After the initial setup, I started to notice some network issues
##This unit gets easily overloaded when under normal use, and I bought it specifically for gaming/streaming HD video from my pc to my Xbox360
##When gaming or streaming, the DIR-655 begins to fail after 20 minutes and loses connectivity; all wireless connections fail
##Inconveniently, the router needs to be manually reset to allow wireless devices to connect again
##This router ended up being the bottleneck in my network, and this unit was less reliable than the older, now discontinued, DI-624
##D-Link's support website is not very helpful, at least not with this issue, and the website makes the tech support number a hassle to find
##I finally managed to call D-Link's tech support to get assistance
##After waiting on hold for half an hour, I was told that no one would be able to help me for quite a while and that I would receive a phone call w/i an hour
##In that time I initiated the return through Amazon, packed up the unit, and dropped it off at a ups store
##I have decided to get a Netgear n600 router to replace it and I will review that upon receipt
##Features
[t] works 52 steps away from unit
##I can sit in back yard and pick up reception
##I'm 5'4" it works 52 steps away from unit
##That is the range I pick up through 2 1 and a half foot thick walls
##Home is on one level
##The lights are so bright it is like a night light in a room
##Too bad cuz I hate to waste energy
##So I put it on a cut off power strip
[t] Excellent product
speed[@]##Have only had this router for a couple of weeks, but noticed the speed difference immediately
##So far no problems
[t] Very good so far ##I've used it for 2 months now
##No issues found so far
speed[@]##It was easy to set up, the speed is almost as good as wired!
[t] D655
##Worked great for about 3 weeks then nothing
##I reset it, reconfigured it and nothing
##Worked great when it worked
[t] Incredible Technolgoy!!!
##THis thing is incredible and amazing best thing in the wolrd my PS3 and laptop aree now online i would buy over agian!!
[t] You've got to be kidding me!!!
##This thing was a PIECE OF CAKE to set up, even with Windows Vista
##It took me 10 minutes from opening the box to using the wireless network
installation[@]##The installation CD walks you through everything
##I highly recommend this router
[t] Good features, average wireless performance
speed[@]##Pros-Great amount of features and customization-Awesome 1GBPS wired connection-Good priceCons-disappointing wireless speed
##Built in "good neighbor policy" is prohibiting wireless n to run at 300mbps and instead falls back to 150mbps
##Overall
[t] Buy an Apple router insted
##When I got this router, I was very excited to set it up as it was my first wireless router
##After a long time of set-up I was impressed the wireless signal filled my whole home! After about 10 months of use the router stopped working, no wireless signal only wired
##I restarted the router and it continued to work, for a couple of hours, it then died again
##I had a Apple Airport Express handling my music playback and doing an excellent job, so I switched my router to the airport express and it continues to work today 2 years later
streaming[@]##I would not recommend buying this router, I would recommend buying an apple airport router as this little box had to take over the wireless for my whole house (and the express is made for small homes and apartments) but it still managed to take the load, on top of wireless music streaming and managing a printer
[t] Good Product - Good Price
##Shipping was fast
##And just about anyone could install and configure this unit
##It comes with a tiny little brochure to get started, but with the install CD it was a piece of cake
port[@]##I really like the USB port for attaching and sharing a printer/device
port[@]##My only gripe is that with the SharePort utility, you have to remember to release the port each time you finish using the printer
##Otherwise you can't access it from another computer
##But I consider it a minor nit
[t] great product
##The shipping was a bit slow for this item, but once we had it, it was all good
##Easy set with instructions, working great, no problems
[t] Good range, speed and LAN port function; USB port almost useless
##In the first two weeks of use, DIR 655 router performed perfectly
##Admittedly, it is being used in a small apartment with laptops only 3 rooms apart, but it has not given one spec of trouble
##Set-up was easy on both laptops
##I have an HP All-in-One printer connected to one one the LAN ports via an Ethernet cable, enabling wireless printing, and that also works well
##The huge disappointment is the USB Shareport
port[@]##Found out that any device connected via this port can only be used by one computer at a time
##Can you imagine the trouble of having to ask one user to disconnect before another can use it? Think how that would work with a printer (read that its a BIG pain in the butt)
port[@][u]##Worse yet, how can you connect an external hard drive and set it up for automatic backups? The only use I can think of for this  is to allow a device which only has a USB connection (i
##e
##, no Ethernet port) the ability to connect wirelessly to ONE computer
speed[@]##We'll give range and speed the big test when we more to a 5-apartment house with three floors of users
[t] Half the speed from the actual Internet service provider
speed[@]##RCN offers me a speed of 20Mbps
##If I connect my macbook directly to the modem I get speeds of 19-20Mbps
##However If I use this router, I get speeds of about 5,7 Mbps and am about 3,4 feet away from the router
##It sucks
[t] D-Link makes promises...
##that this product doesn't keep for them
##Could not get stable N speeds from this router in a professional SOHO setting, after countless hours of fiddling with it, and several devices it was connecting
##As usual, there are plenty of bugs and undocumented features in the firmware
##Half-baked wireless N firmware
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Comments by Lasertrimman
##I bought the D-Link DIR-655 to replace my unreliable U
##S
##Robotics (USR5461)
##I needed a router as well as print server
##I wanted an N band wireless connection as well as the older G band capability
##D-Link claims its 655 will do it all and so it does
##I must say that the virtual printer connection was very difficult to set up
##The firmware with the hardware and the drivers on the hard disk were all too old and not up to the task
##So the first thing to do is get online and find the newest firmware and drivers and load them in
##Then go online and Google problems with the printer (and any other USB device) connection and follow their recommended settings if you have problems like I did
##The great news is that I have not had to reboot the router once since I got the box 1 month ago
[t] Very Satisfied
##I bought this router about 3 weeks ago, and I'm extremely satisfied
speed[@]##I live in a two storey house and I get full speed 54m as well as 130mbps
##Setup was a little difficult but could be done if done per the instructions
[t] Needs More Range
##I bought this product to replace my two year old wireless G Linksys router which I was having to reset constantly
##I went with wireless N because I wanted more range
##I went with this product in particular because of several reviews stating that the range was exceptional
##Well, the range on this router is significantly less than the range I had on my wireless G Linksys
##With my Linksys, I could listen to Pandora on my iPhone dock in my shop while connected to the Linksys router in my house; as long as the garage door was open
##I figured going with a wireless N router would give me the little bit extra power I needed to be able to listen to Pandora with the door closed
##Unfortunately, my signal bar drops to one bar even I just step outside and there is no chance of getting a wifi connection in my shop even if the door is open
##The two routers were installed in the same location
##This is my only gripe with the router, though it was a major one for me
##The router is attractive and smaller than my old Linksys G
##It has proven to be reliable in the time I have had it; I haven't had to reset it once
##Setup was a bit of a hassle
##I was just replacing my old router so I wanted to keep the same network name and password
##It didn't like this very much, It would never finalize the connection
##After spending about an hour on the phone with tech service checking things I had already checked, he had me go to a website that enabled me to use the correct name for the new network
##All is well since then, except for the range that is
[t] no big deal
##I purchased this to replace my wireless G
##The reception is worse and the downloads are no different
##My 35 dollars wireless router was just as good or better than this one, too bad I sold it to my friend
[t] Gigabit versus Linksys G
speed[@]##I bought this router to increase the range and speed at my office
##The Linksys wireless G router I had was always very low in terms of signal strenth
##The Gigabit router is about 6x (as advertised) better in my particular circumstances
##That means I get a low signal instead of a very low
##On the downside, it's about $40 more than the Linksys
##Moreover, the setup required a call to tech support to configure the wireless properly, which the tech rep said was common
##The tech support was very good, very fast
##The Linksys setup was a snap (as advertised) and worked perfectly out of the box
speed[@]##It's just that the range and speed weren't as good
[t] Excellent router! I am very happy with this replacement of a Linksys router.
##Probably I cannot say anything that has not already been said about this router
##I am very happy with the performance and ease of use of this router
security[@]##I particularly like the GUEST security zone, which allows my part-time neighbors to use my WiFi and keeps my secure network separated from the guest network
##I have not had any of the heat issues some people have had
##Yes, the LEDs are bright
##Not an issue for me
##The only thing I wish they had done was put the LEDs on the top edge (or some lenses) so that you could see them if you wall-mount it (like I did)
##Also make the labels of the LEDs larger for old eyes like mine
##Minor issues though, especially compared to performance of this unit which is excellent
[t] Easy, Fast and Reliable
##We are very pleased with this router
##The setup was straight forward and took about 20 minutes to configure
##It gives a strong connection throughout the house
##We use it to link both a MacBook Pro and a PC (1) to the Internet, (2) to a wireless printer, and (3) to each other through Network Magic
##The router is about 18 paces from the MacBook and the printer, and 15 paces from the PC
##The MacBook and PC are about 30 paces from each other
##All the connections are strong and fast
##I do not sense any difference between a wired and a wireless connection
##The instructions were easy to follow
##My only hesitation is that it does not seem to support SecureEasySetup (TM) for which my printer instructions gave an option
##Nonetheless, I was able to configure my printer using the information that I had recorded when installing the router
##When I visited my parents a month ago, I took the router with me and hooked it directly to my father's modem which gave us wireless access throughout the house
##No configuration was necessary for it to work with his modem
##I also used it that way in one of the hotels where we stayed on the way
##I bought this router after returning a Netgear router
##My MacBook could not run the Netgear setup CD, inspite of instructions saying that it could
##And the PC could not properly configure it either
##After three hours and many attempts to run the Netgear configuration CD, I returned it to the store where I bought it and ordered this D-Link router
##As I said, when the D-Link router arrived, I was able to configure it in 20 minutes and have had no need to look back
##It is barely warm to the touch, and by no means hot
##It measures about 7
##5 x 4
##5 x 1
##25 inches
##Having used it for two months, I can recommend it
##It is easy to install, fast and reliable
[t] I feel better than D-Link past product.
##I bought this product 2 months ago
##In past, I used DIR-615 from D-Link
##DIR-615 is bad
internet[@]##That wireless router disconnect often internet service and local network
##But I bought this product less $30 when radio shock company closed
##So I buy this one(DIR-655) instead of returning DIR-615
speed[@]##DIR-655's local network speed is great
##Now I'm using some device-iPhone 3G, 3 laptop(Ubuntu, Windows, Mac), private wired Storage(Iomega Home Media 1TB, below aka
##ANS)
speed[@]##NAS(wired) to laptop(wireless) transfer speed is2~3 MB/sec in DIR-615 (old) (1 GB transfer need minimum 8
##0 minutes)5~8 MB/sec in DIR-655 (now) (1 GB transfer need minimum 3
##3 minutes )Laptop(wireless) to NAS(wired) transfer spped is1~2 MB/sec in DIR-615 (old) (1 GB transfer need minimum 16
##6 minutes2~4 MB/sec in DIR-655 (new) (1 GB transfer need minimum 8
##3 minutesMy NAS device is support to 1Gb ethernet
##and My laptop support 802
speed[@]##11gSo theoretical, transfer speed must be less than above value
speed[@]##But I don't care this time for manage photo, video and programs in that grade speed
speed[@]##If you make local wireless home network, check my home speed and your expected satisfaction speed

[t] Great for total home coverage
##Set was easy, basically plug and go
security[@][u]##After set up was complete attaching additional laptops from other areas of the house was a little harder but not by much, beacuse you had to enter the  code you used during the initial set up
##Also I noticed that I have an older computer that does not accept the N signal and I cannot connect this Laptop to router
##We currently have the router set up in my wife's office in the basement of the house but the signal throughout the rest of the house is very strong
##I would recommend this router
[t] great router for all around use
##this is a great router
##set up did require a call to dlink but was effortless - they were around at 1 in the morning and the call only took about 8 minutes
internet[@]##our laptop sure seems accessing the the internet quicker
##it has not failed in 3 weeks of use like our old router used to
port[@][u]##one the coolest features is the usb  so you can create a wireless printer network with any printer
##2 thumbs up overall
[t] Don't buy this router
##This is my first review on Amazon, although I have made many purchases
##I am so disgusted with this router and the dlink support that I just had to warn others not to purchase this product
##Router worked fine for about 1 month, and then quit
##It loses the signal and then reboots constantly
##Contacted dlink support and they are no help whatsoever
##Finally was given return authorization, but I honestly do not want another router with problems
internet[@]##Search the internet and you will find many complaints about this router
##Wish I had before I made this purchase
[t] Ultimate Video Gaming Router
##I had this router set up and working in 10 minutes
##I connected my PS3 within 5 minutes after that via wireless connection
##With my old router I could not figure out all the password codes and network keys and therefore had to set it up with a wired connection
##Now I can take my PS3 to any TV in the house and play online, with a strong connection
##If you like to play video games online this router is for you
price[@][u]##yes the  is steep compared to other routers, but you won't have to worry about losing connection during gaming, lag of connectivity during gaming, and will send the wireless connection throughout your house
##I'm very pleased with this product and knowing what it is capable of I would spend another [
##] bucks on it if I had to
[t] Incredible
##Incredible product, I would recommend this for anyone
##Please note, the complexity to setup a new wireless device can be difficult
##Please consult a professional if you need assistance
##(not geek squad!)
[t] So far so good
##Item shipped out quickly, was in good condition, came with easy to use set-up disk
internet[@][u]##we haven't had to 're-set' the router at all so far since it's delivery, so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless  connection on her laptop
security[@]##added security benefits, neighbors no longer hogging signal, well worth the purchase price!
[t] Great -- but doesn't work
##Purchased this router but could never get it working in wireless mode with my laptop
##The connection would drop every 1 to 2 minutes with a message in the log saying "authentication failed"
##Most times it would reconnect immediately, but sometimes wouldn't
##Basically it was unusable as is
##Support tried a bunch of things, but in the end told me to return it
##My laptop is frequently used on other wireless networks without a problem, and the DIR-655 replaced an older, cheaper Belkin which worked
##So it's not environmental, like phones etc
##It must be a flaw in the router
##This seems to be a common problem with this router
[t] Way Too Hard to Setup
##I spent many hours trying to configure the router on my own
##I spent another 2 or 3 hours with D-Link support (who was rather nice but never followed up when the support request was escalated)
internet[@]##I could not get the router to connect to the internet
##It was frustrating beyond belief
##I have never had an issue setting up a router before
##My Airport Express is plug and play
##Linksys routers are always a breeze
##Setting up this D-Link was an exercise in futility
##I would give it negative stars if I could
speed[@][u]##I chose this router because it got great reviews on it's  and range, and I liked the idea that I could connect a USB drive to create a cheap NAS
##Most reviewers do comment on the complexity of the setup, so I was prepared to do a bit more leg work
internet[@]##However, I did not expect to waste so many hours trying to get the thing to connect to the internet
##It may have been a faulty router as the ethernet ports did not seem to work either
##But, I am not willing to risk learning that D-Link simply makes overly complex equipment
##Save yourself a headache
[t] Please stop selling this router
##Dear D-Link,Please stop manufacturing this router
internet[@]##For the last 18 months, I have struggled keeping an internet connection active for more than two days straight
##In reviewing your user forums, it appears that many others have had similar struggles
##I've held on, hoping that a magic firmware update would be issued that would make all of the issues disappear
##Hasn't happened yet
##I just bought a Linksys router to replace the DIR-655
##It's working great, it was easy to set up, and I feel good about abandoning the D-Link product line
[t] Nothing But Problems
##Since I purchased this device I have not had reliable service from it
##And trying to get help from Dlink customer service is a joke, none of them know anything about wireless routers
##All they know is to cut and paste standard responses
##And when I follow up, they don't read the previous history to see what was already tried
##I never had problems with Linksys hardware
##Remind me never to consider switching to Dlink again, it just doesn't work very well
[t] DiLink DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Routeer
##Not too impressed with signal strength of this router
##I had a G router from Linksys that would work from 100 yards away, this one only goes about 30-45
##However setup was easy and it works fine
[t] A real blessing.
##This D-Link is better than advertised
##The ease of setting up a private wireless network is really a blessing
[t] Good Router
##The product arrived on time and was easy to set up
##It replaced an old Belkin G router that was starting to fail
##It didn't increase the range of the WiFi, but it is very reliable
[t] It works well enough for my needs
##I'm not sure about all the bells and whistles, but I was just a uninformed customer looking for a decent router
##The router is set up about 50 feet away from me through a couple walls
##Well, it works
##Hold 5 bars too
##Very rarely do I DC
##I've had it for about two months so far
##TLDR
[t] Excellent Router
##I have had this router for about six months now - I wanted to see how it fared for awhile before commenting on it
##Not much to say - it works very well with excellent reception on our wireless devices anywhere in our home
##No dropouts, etc
##Great router!
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Router
##Seems to work just fine handling three networked workstations and two not-in-network separate computers
##Network is PCs, others are macs
##No problems to date, much better than a netgear residential size we had before
[t] Goes out DAILY
##Everyday this router stops functioning for some reason
##I have to pull the power cord and wait for it to reset
##Avoid this one!
[t] Overpriced junk
##I bought this to replace a 4 year older wireless N router that broke
internet[@]##I only use it to stream internet to my Roku box
streaming[@][u]##My old router got 4 bars to my roku box and fast downloads and 
##The new router only one i can tell a differences in video quality
##It broke after 3 months of use
##Pros- easy setupCon- crap range and signal strength- overpriced- Broke after 3 months of use- unit is garabage
[t] No Good - Avoid
##This product is only good if you are looking for a very very short useful life
##Very disappointing
##Router was easy to set up and configure with good strong signal
internet[@]##Unfortunately it stayed connected to the internet for all of two hours before dropping
##Since then it will not connect to the internet, will not reset, rebooting does not help
##Of course, tech support is useless
[t] Wish it would have worked.
##I spent almost an entire day attempting to setup the router
##I'm no slouch when it comes to networking or computers but no matter what I attempted, could not get the router to broadcast a signal
##Wired it worked perfectly but after several frustrating hours I gave up
##I have hooked up my old Linksys router and will continue to keep my eyes open for a good deal for a quality product
[t] Disappointing
##I've had D-link routers for a number of years, as they come highly recommended from my computer savvy son-in-law
##We expected great things from this router, however after several days of trying to get it to function properly, my son-in-law had to give up
##We returned the router for a refund and ended up with a different D-Link system, purchased at Best Buy which functions perfectly
##Possibly this one particular router wasn't manufactured properly (my son-in-law was very high on it and rather dismayed at its inability to function properly) but I can not recommend this router at this point
##The DIR-651 I have in use now has done the job quite readily
[t] do not buy this one
##it constantly disconnect
##and heat is a horrible thing
##do not buy this one
##save some money for other branch
[t] Excellent Router
##I was looking for an N router because that's the top of line, but I didn't want to spend for a top end product
##It works great
##Set up was easy
##I had no issues, just had to disconnect and reconnect cable modem once instead of turning it off
##But other than that the LAN PC's and wireless ones seemed fine and signal was really strong
security[@][u]##Also during the set up it asks if you want strongest  protection and suggests strong passwords, which is great instead of having to go into a settings later
##So far so good, it looks like a great purchase
[t] Somewhat pleased and disappointed
##I've had this router (rev
##B1) for a couple of months and have for a large part been very pleased with it
##I do not have the heat or dropout issues others have complained of and the range is very good
##The amount of options this router offers is impressive but it can also be confusing for those less technically savvy
##My major complaint with this router is that it absolutely refuses to work with my VOIP device (Nettalk Duo) and many, many others have complained with VOIP issues with this router
##A firmware update has not helped this issue and D-Link support has been less than helpful
##I am really hoping for another firmware update that will resolve this issue but it's looking less and less likely everyday
##If you are planning to use a VOIP device with this router be sure to research your device's compatibility with this router and tread cautiously
##If not, this is a pretty good and feature rich router for the money (even if D-Link support is less than great)
[t] Not what I expected from D-Link
##The wired portion works great
##The wireless drops out at least a couple times a day
##The wireless doesn't even show up on the "Available Wireless Networks"
##If I unplug it and plug it in again it works fine
internet[@]##I have been all over the internet looking for "The Answer"
##What I see is "It could be this or could be that" It would be nice if D-Link had "The Answer"
[t] EXPENSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT
##Only worked right for a couple months
##Started to slow down and drop the connection
##Needs to be reset at least 3 times a day
##Not very reliable,not very well built, not made to last
##Broadcast range

streaming[@][u]##We bought this router because it was time to upgrade to "N" from "G", and we recently bought a Vizio Blu-ray player that was lagging while  Netflix on the old Lynksys Wireless "G"
internet[@]##I reasearched only a few internet reviews on this unit before purchasing it, mainly the one in PC magazine written in April 07 [
##]This unit was on sale at the local AFB AFEES store as it was being replaced with the new Wireless N+ 300 Dual Band router, so we picked it up and brought it home
software[@],installation[@]##I installed the software and started to go to work setting it up, only to find that the software would not program it past the third step of installation
##No big deal, I had to program the old "G" router "Old School" style, so I will do the same with this one
##Dropped the address in Internet Explorer and everything came to life
internet[@],streaming[@]##Adjusted the settings as directed by the manual, and from the tricks I read on the internet and WHAT A ROUTER!!! We are hooked up to road Runner cable (Time Warner), and the router has us running between 130 and 300 MBPS on all three laptops and one desktop, and has the blu-ray, WII, and X-box 360 wireless streaming effortlessly! The wireless printer we have is "G", and thanks to the backkwards compatability of this router, hooked up easily and runs wonderfully on our home network
##I have run multiple tests on every computer at [
##] and we are outperforming most everyone else that tests at the site, including our cable provider
##We do not have the overheating issues that others have written about, and the unit is actually cool to the touch on top, and just mildly warm on the bottom
##We have it located about a foot away from the cable modem as the directions state to locate it to allow it to breathe well
##I do agree the blue lights on the unit are very bright
##If that bothers you too much, utilize the stand it comes with and the lights will be facing down and that should eliminate the problem
security[@][u]##The options with this unit are wonderful, including the  mesaures, QOS and prioritization with "WISH"
##This is THE router if you are running multiple wireless units, need large home reception, and don't want to break the bank upgrading your home network
port[@][u],installation[@][u]##CON- only complaint is that I tried to hook up a network hard drive ot the USB  in the back of the router, and it requires an  code that WD could not provide
installation[@][u]##So if that is something you are interested in, make sure you purchase your network product that has the  codes for the router
##Overall, VERY PLEASED with this router, and would buy one again in a minute
##I am especially please that multiple different types of connection adapters have success connecting to the router with great reception and transmission speeds
##Well done D-Link!!!
[t] Fine router. Many options
##I am well pleased with the D-Link DIR-655 router
##It is fast, and it has many controls and settings
##Good points
[t] I am going to give this a second chance
##I recieved this router 01 Feb 2011
##Set up was easy, worked very well for about 3 weeks
##As of late, the router drops the signal and I have to reboot it
##At first I thought it was my ISP, but I put my old router back for a week and did not have any connectivity problems (just speed-that is why I bought the new router)
##I called Amazone today 15 Mar and they are going to send out another one at no charge
##I will give it a second try before just sending it back for a full refund and choosing a different brand
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
[t] works great so far
##i had problems setting up my wireless network and the cable co suggested i call D Link; so i did- at midnight- and they were there
##the gentleman on the phone was soooooo helpful and within 10-15 minutes everything was working beautifully
##i don't know if it will work next week- but right now its perfect
##i cannot thank the people at D-Link enough- i don't know how other wireless router companies work, but these people will help you no matter what
##once again, thank you amazon for having products reviewed and thank you D-LInk for all your help
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##When my last router died after less than a year and after everything I went through to install it and its predecessors, I was not looking forward to having to install yet another wireless router
##My last router was NOT a D-Link, but the one before this last one was, and they both were a nightmare to install
##I'm no computer genius, but I'm not a computer idiot either
##I consider myself somewhat above average when it comes to computer and networking knowledge, but still thanks to the experience of the previous two routers, I was not looking forward to having to install yet another one
##I imagined hours and hours of cursing, screaming, throwing things, and even more cursing before I came anywhere close to my goal of a stable wireless network in my home
installation[@]##Imagine my surprise, then, when I sat down with my laptop and a cup of coffee in the office, popped in the installation disk, followed the instructions, and BAM! my new network was up and running before my coffee had even cooled enough to do more than sip it
##It really was that simple
##I think it took me longer to configure the two Windoze 7 computers to the new network than it did to install it (and that was only because it took me a few minutes to figure out that Windoze 7 does not treat hitting "enter" the same as clicking the "okay" button)
##The range and strength within that range is even better than my previous NetGear router, my DSi and Wii seem to play nicer with the D-Link than they did with the NetGear, and all 4 household computers, with OS's ranging from XP to Vista to Windoze 7, get along quite nicely with the D-Link and subsequently with each other
##I can't comment on lifespan as I've only had it a few weeks, but in all other respects, I am very happy with the D-Link
##If this one looks like its going to last longer than a year, I might just have to buy a spare to have on hand in case of emergency
[t] Works great for me. 5 Stars!!
##I don't know it all when it comes to networking
##I just wanted a wireless router that is fast, has a good coverage area, and is easy to setup
##I have 2 laptops and a desktop all connected at the same time and I've not had a problem
##5 stars for this guy
[t] Not working
##I have been trying to get the DIR-655 to work with my Dell system
##I have contacted D-Link & Dell
##I have tried cards, and USB ports from Dell and still can not get the wireless and my computer to connect
##I give up
##I am going to attempt to return the DIR-655 back to Amazon for credit
[t] Just what I needed
##I decided to upgrade to a 802
##11n gigabit network
##I'm actually using this router as a wired router merely because I had an extra 802
##11n router that I use as an access point in my tv room where we mostly use our laptop to get a stronger signal
##However, when I did use the DIR-655 for my wireless, I got a very good signal from the basement, but the access point is even stronger
##I was mostly shooting to upgrade to gigabit because I do a lot of file transfers between devices on my network
##The DIR-655 does its work very well, although I would have liked an even stronger signal
##The best part for me is the ability to reserve local ip addresses to specific devices through DHCP
##Understand I used to use a Linksys 54g router and Linksys, for some reason, doesn't allow for this
port[@]##It was especially important because my ReplayTV devices need fixed IP address for workable port forwarding
##Static IP's are a real annoyance
##Overall, I am very happy with this router
[t] Does Not Work
##This on the surface seems like a great product
##Unfortunately, had a ton of difficulty getting it to install on my computer
##There is a new firmware version out (1
##31), but it comes out in
##bin format and is a pain to get to work
##Their support staff is very friendly and understanding, but I didn't want to any more hours trying to get this product to work
##I will look for a better router
##I am also wondering if having Verizon Online DSL has anything to do with it
[t] Fits my needs
##Ability to make this Router invisible along with MAC filters has made my wireless network very, very private
##I've helped friends and relativces setup other brands and models, this Router gave me more options without hassles
[t] Excellent Wireless Router
##This dlink router has been many levels above the netgear and linksys routers I have used in the past
##1Gbps ports, Draft Wireless N, advanced configuration options through a web interface, sub $100 price, small form factor, long range wireless reach, and even cool blue blinking lights
##Hard to go wrong with this wireless router and if other dlink products are of this quality and value, then I will continue to buy
[t] Great !
##Works Great
##Setup was easy
##Range is sufficient for me
##Price was reasonable
##Well satisfied with this product
[t] Awesome router
##I received this router from Amazon and immediately installed it using the D Link Setup Wizard
##The process was flawless and quick
##I was replacing an installed router that was malfunctioning
speed[@]##The unit runs cool and was a significant improvement in speed and functional capability over the D Link Dir 615 router I was using
##I would recommend this product to anyone
##A note concerning the reviewer who had a heat issue
##Perhaps the plastic wrap was not removed before use as this wrap cover the vents as the warning label so states
[t] The router that aspires to be a paperweight.
##Bought this based on the good reviews and the bad reviews of other routers
##The range of this router is pathetic compared to the range of the Linksys G it replaced
speed[@]##The speed is fine with a bunch of manual tweaks
##Even with the tweaks it's not good enough to rave about, not crappy enough to return
##Until today
##Forty seven days after purchase (with one or two drop offs in between that time) the router stops working
##So, I do what I've done for years -- unplug it, wait 20-30 seconds, plug it back in
##Once plugged back in
##nothing
##No power light
##No buzzing
##Nothing
##I now have, in essence, a $94 brick that is 17 days beyond Amazon's 30 day return policy
##This router is mediocre when it works and if my experience is any indication, is nothing more than a paperweight in training
##I'm buying local for the next one, which will probably be the much maligned Linksys N
##D-Link had their chance and failed miserably
[t] Wireless Router
##So far i have found no faults with this router , It's range is great and I would rate it with 5 star rating, A little pricy, but works just fine
[t] Great router
##I was struggling with an older router that would need to be reset at least once a week
##I have a direct wired Tivo, Xbox and Vista machine as well as a wireless laptop
##Since I've setup this new router, I've had no issues with the router locking up (as would happen with NetFlix on Tivo and would force me to restart Tivo - a five minute process)
##Definitely recommend as a router that can handle a number of different devices
[t] Terrible Range
##I bought this router to improve the range on my old D-Link G router
##I had high expectations only to find out that the range is worse than the old single antenna D-Link
##Searches with bing showed several customers experiencing similar range problems
##Currently the router is positioned close to a corridor and recpetion in rooms off of the corridor are 2 bars at best
##Awful!
[t] doesn't route as well as my old router
internet[@]##I bought this for the N network and range, both of which is good, but it doesn't route internet as well as my old wrt54G, so in short i did not like it
##but i used the old router to route and this one as a access point
##It works for me
[t] KNOWN PROBLEM - WARNING
##I recently bought this product and set it up and it was working great for 24 hours when the whole unit just stopped broadcasting the wireless signal completely, so i restarted it and the signal came back
##I didn't think too much of it and the next day the same thing happened, and the next day too
##So I looked online and this is a known problem with the DIR-655 model
##Just Google "dir-655 stops broadcasting"
##This problem is extremely annoying and requires a restart averaging every 24 hours making continuous usage impossible
##There are many posts on DLinks forums about this problems and no one has yet to provide a solution to the problem
##I would Avoid this unit if possible
[t] Works on everything except my my Lenovo H320 Desktop
##After reading all the superlative reviews on this product, I bought not 1 but 2 of these routers for 2 offices
##Little did I know that no matter what type of settings I tried, the Dlink D-655 would fail to connect with my primary computer, a Lenovo H320 with a gigabit network card and an i5 processor
##It's not a problem with just one Dlink DIR 655 router since BOTH routers would not connect to my Lenovo computer, but the DIR655 had no problems with my older XP machines
internet[@]##Specifically the router could not see the computer, much less connect to the LAN or internet
##One could blame the Lenovo for not connecting to the Dlink but it connected to a Netgear router without a hitch
##Otherwise seems to work fine but the range is not as wide as my previous Medialink router, which failed after just 6 months, and should be avoided at all cost even though it too has a very high rating
##Goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover, or ratings in this case
[t] Faulty, frustrating disaster
##Bought this router early July, set up was relatively easy and straightforward (I've set up many routers and home networks before, though)
internet[@]##Every 4-5 hours we will lose our internet connection for anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes
##Then it will magically come back up
##As of this moment, I have called tech support seven (7) times now - each time they had me change a different setting
##Why wouldn't they just have me change all those settings right off the bat?Irritating and illogical
##It doesn't matter though, because even after approx
##3 hours time spent with D-link tech support, my router still does not function as it should - I still get extremely slow and/or intermittent connections every 4-6 hours
##Completely unacceptable
##I will be returning this P
##O
##S
##for a refund ASAP
[t] New DLink Router is sleek, but setup has problems
##Nice looking DLink router
##Stands upright well, etc
##Has 3 antennae, which is a big plus
##Wireless bandwidth seemed to improve, but I suspect that the prior 3/4 year old DLink router I had was failing (which appears to be a characteristic of either Linksys or Dlink --- they are guaranteed to fail in a 3 - 4 years
[t] unnoticeable power
##I bought this router because my old netgear router was starting to loose range
##This router claims to have very good range so when I hooked it up and got it going it was just as or less powerful then my netgear router
internet[@],speed[@]##And the range was the same and the internet speed was slower
##If your looking for a router for a small one story house then this is the router for you
##Dont expect it to cover a two story house or anything bigger then that
[t] Don't buy it!
##I bought this product in Feb 2011 to replace my old Dlink router
speed[@]##I thought this new model should bring up speed and be reliable by having new n & g mode
##It worked perfectly for about a week, then the problems came
##The connection is not reliable and constantly dropped
##I called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware, but this did not solve the problem
##They said the product was defective and said they would send a new one
##After that arrived, I was to send the old one to them
##However, the day before the new replacement router arrived, our original router started to work like it did the first day we bought it
##The connection was smooth, didn't drop all the time, and was much faster
##However, the day the replacement router arrived, things got complicated
##The replacement was even worse than the original one, which was now working fine
##We had already agree to return the original one, but that was the one that actually worked
##I am disappointed in this product
##It is too much of a hassle, so next time, I will buy routers from a different company
[t] Worst router ever - very poor coverage - drops all the time
##this is the worst router ever, coverage was very poor, very dificult to set updo not waste your money!returned after just 1 day
[t] Good Router
##I'm not a very tech oriented person and this router works well
##As far as reliability is concerned, I've only had it a short while
[t] A real pain to set up...
##I've set up six other wireless networks and this, by far, was the biggest pain
##It took about 3 hours to set up
##My last two routers were Belkin and they were easy to set up
security[@]##The security features for the Belkins were amazingly simple
security[@]##After setting up this router the first time and saving the security features, I rebooted it but the security features were not saved
##For some unknown reason, I just couldn't get it up and running
##I wanted to step up to N+ and the ratings for this seemed pretty mixed
speed[@]##There was a dramatic increase in speed and range once setup was complete
speed[@]##The reception was about the same (78%) for most of my devices, but increase in speed was noticeable
##Price was about $20 cheaper than Newegg
##If I didn't enjoy playing with electronics so much, I would have been frustrated by the setup and given up
##I'm on the fence about recommending it
price[@]##If the set up went smooth, it would have been worth the price
##It's working fine with everything I have running (2 Tivo's, 2 xbox 360's, a PS3, a laptop and I-pad)
[t] Good Router
##I needed a wireless N router, and I needed one with some extended range
##I wireless G wasn't cutting it anymore, but at the same time I needed a router that could handle a PS3, Xbox 360, 2 laptops, and occasionally a smartphone or two
##This router does all that with ease
security[@][u]##Easy set up, easy enough to figure out how to set  settings
##Also the bright lights don't bother me as much, because this router sits in my living room which my room mate and I don't use very much
##Also the complaints about it getting hot I have not discovered, partly because we have it on an extra cooling rack so it gets plenty of air to cool down
##Overall great buy, great seller, and I would give this product a solid 4/5, and this seller a perfect 5/5!!P

[t] Works Well
##Has great range
##I live in a brick house and am able to get the signal several hundred feet outside of the house
##No issues with heat as others seem to have
[t] Slow wireless speeds no matter what I do
##I have 3 802
##11n computers that I use with this router
##Whenever I stream either a 600mb movie or a DVD rip the video skips due to slow transfer speeds
##All of my computers are newer and have updated firmware
##My router has updated firmware as well
##I know enough about computers / networks to troubleshoot
##I know not to use TKIP etc
##Ive tried changing options and settings but my video would always skip
##I bought an Asus N12 router to flash with WW-DRT and use as a wireless repeater for my 360 across the house
streaming[@]##One day I decided to swap routers so I unplugged my 655 and threw the N12 in its place and BAM!, amazing streaming capabilities
##The $39 Asus is a ton faster then the 655
##I'm not here to promote the Asus but it was the only basis of comparison that I have
##The point of my review is to warn you about my experience and let you know that there are better options out there for less money
##Do you research and save some coin
[t] D-Link Extreme N Router
##Excellent Router, have used D-Link for years and this model is no exception
internet[@]##Great distance, using it to supply internet to several mobile homes up to 150 feet from each other
##No problems, easy install and connecion
[t] Very Nice. Good value
##This is my first wireless N router
##I bought it to go behind my Uverse router
internet[@]##I'm connecting Lan to Lan to the Uverse 2-wire gateway - so the D-link connects to the internet through the 2-wire
##It is working well
[t] Love this router!
##I *always* recommend this router to anyone that I can
##It has been extremely reliable and is very fast
##It also has terrific wireless range as well
##I love having a gigabit home network (especially when transferring a lot of movies and pictures)
##Don't think twice - get this router
[t] Good, but not great
##I purchased this to transmit to all of my house
##I anticipated a stronger signal in my basement
speed[@]##The speed is still good but the reception is "low"
##Overall, I am pleased, but it is not great
[t] Great wireless router, good price!
##I've had theD-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Routerfor almost 4 months now, and am very happy with it
##My old wireless router was getting old, and did not support 802
##11n, which my smartphone and Blu-ray player do
##Coverage is excellent throughout the house
[t] Do not buy this
##I was warned by friends not to buy D Link because it has frequent service interruptions but I ignored their advice
##I found a good deal and decided to buy it, figuring it could not possibly be worse than the Linksys router my parents suffered with for years
##Boy was I wrong
##Literally not a day has gone by where I did not have to reset the router
##Its been a month and I have to reset it every single day and if I am home all day on a computer then often I'll have to reset 2 or 3 times
##What a colossal waste of money
##I am currently returning this item and going to get a more trustworthy brand
[t] Easy, Easy Set-up
##I received this item today and spent approximately 20 minutes setting it up
installation[@]##I followed the installation CD's step by step by step instructions and quickly established my wireless network
##I know I should wait for a while before reviewing this, but right now, I'm just pleased with the easy set-up and what seems to be a great product
streaming[@]##I am streaming Pandora in the bedroom, my wife is using her ipod touch to play an online game while watching a movie in the den
##What more could I ask?
[t] Great While it Lasted
##This router was a great one that I had for a long time, but after a couple years it just stopped working and I couldn't use it anymore
##While it was working though, it output a very strong signal and was very fast
##It was also very easy to configure and was just a pleasure to use
##Worth the money and served me well
##Other than the fact it stopped working, this was a great router
[t] Works fine before dead
##Bought this router about two years ago
##It has been worked fine until recently drops the connection from time to time
##Dead completely yesterday
##Coverage is OK, while my cell and pad still have bars behind 3-4 walls (about 50 feet away)
[t] Everything about it was great, then it died
##Everything about this router was great
##Performance, size, setup
##The menus are really easy to use
##Has a great form-factor
##Then after 3 months of use being solid as a rock, it locked up once needing to be rebooted - then a day later, it went totally bonkers
##I sent it back to Amazon (returns after 30 days are not very simple) and got a Netgear N900 - better, but costs over twice as much
##Was mine just a lemon or does this line have a high failure rate? Who knows
##The DIR-655 a great value if you can get it to hang with you
[t] A great buy
##Bought this with along with a Motorola Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem
##Never have any problems! A great router and easy to use
##Highly recommend

##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless RouterThis product was easy to install after initial discussion with their help desk
##Old router would have to be re-booted numerous times each day and multiple users would cause the router to drop

##At this point, very happy with this product
[t] DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router
##I had the DIR-615 and somehow lost it or sold it and don't remember
##But I loved the 615 and needed a new router and found a great deal on the 655
##Just got it and setup was really easy and fast
##The performance is so far matching what the people say about in the reviews
[t] perfect... when it works
##I picked up this router 6 days ago and got everything working
##the quick and easy setup disk worked like a charm and everything went fine for about a week
##on the 6th day of running it decided to reset itself over and over again until i unplugged it for a couple hours
##after plugging everything back in the router would turn on but wouldnt connect to my computer via wire or wireless so i called tech support
##im not a dummy when it comes to electronics i work as a tech guy selling and fixing everything from laptops to remote controls
##the lady i talked to (sharque is how she pronounced her name) was not fluent in english at all, and she didnt understand what the word reset meant
##im giving this router a 2 out of 5 simply becuase it works occasinally and thats too much to give personally
[t] Straight out of the box
##I unhooked my previous D-Link product (which was so old they didn't support it anymore) and hooked up this one
installation[@][u]##After the bried  process, everything worked perfectly
##It seems to be considerably faster but it's somewhat difficult to quantify
##My ROKU works perfectly w/o any hesitation and all my other nodes seem to operate well
##I don't believe I see any further range but again, it's difficult to tell
##So far so good; my son won't be able to try out the live gaming until he comes home from college
##I'd expect this will be the most demanding application
[t] D-link Dir-655 Wireless Router
##I must say the D-Link DIR-655 Extrime-N Giabit Wireless Router was very easy to install
##It didn't take long to arrive at my home and only took me about tweenty min
##to install
##It workes great and now I can use my laptop any where aroudn my home without having to plug in
##This is the only router I have ever purchased and the information given at the time of purchase was very helpful
##I did have a little trouble at the time of purchase but Amazon
##com gave a phone # where I recived great help
[t] Buy if you want a no good very bad day.
##I rated this at one star because it simply did not work for me
internet[@]##After a day and a half of trying, I could connect to the router but it could not detect an internet connection and get online (which to me is one of the more critical functions of a router)
internet[@]##I duplicated the settings from my old work horse Linksys WRT54g router (which by the way works fine on my network) but could not establish an internet connection
##From reading other reviews, it seems like its a hit and miss product, that is, it works great for some, fails for others
##I feel like I took a chance and got a bad egg
##If its helpful to anyone, I'm using a Motorola SURFboard cable modem
##What made me return this product outright was the tech support from DLink
##It was worse than non existent
##The tech support number in the packaging didn't even take me to a DLink (something about ADT security) and the phone number from their support website for this product took me to a PHONE SEX HOTLINE
security[@]##I couldn't believe it! Maybe they got hacked??? But if that's true, how good is the security features on their products?I went out to the store and picked up a different brand router
##I won't mention names since I'm not advertising here
##Anyways, I got that one set up and online in about 10 min
##Will never buy DLink again
##If you buy a DLink router I hope you have a better experience than I
[t] Great for everything but Apple TV
##The DIR-655 router worked great with my PC and iMac, but wireless just wouldn't stay connected to my Apple TV device (first generation)
##Tried a variety of settings after hours of investigation on many Apple and D-Link forums but no luck, would get intermittent wireless disconnects almost daily
##Really wanted to keep this router but re-setting up the ATV wireless connection everyday was not very convenient
##Ended up re-connecting my old (D-Link)router and sent this one back to Amazon
##Will now try a Netgear product
##Would not recommend the DIR-655 for those who have a first gen ATV on their wireless networks
[t] Cumbersome & Difficult Install, Otherwise 5 Star Operation
##The install CD wouldn't work correctly, so I opted for the manual install with incomplete instructions enclosed with the unit
##Still had to call manufacturer CS to get the configuration corrected and get the 2
##03 Firmware update - over all took a few hours
##Manufacturer CS fine, but their website log in authetication code was a tad difficult to crack as it wasn't simple aplhas and numerics, some symbols were squares [not a O or zero] or backward Es [not a 3]
##Thus I knocked a couple of stars off for this cumbersome install
installation[@]##After installation complete and placement of unit ensured a clear path to wifi devices, the unit seems to be working perfectly fine worthly of 5 stars after 3 days use
[t] Poor Range - USB interface doesn't work for hard drives
##Pros
[t] Meh
##I took a chance but shouldn't have
##Speed was good, when wireless worked
##Had good uptime for a few weeks then had to start powering down/up almost daily
##No firmware update to try and fix it
##Sent it back
##Bought a Buffalo
[t] AAA+ Router
##I have had this router for over a month and have had "0"drop outs in that time
##The range is not all that great,but is probably due to the configuration of my home
##I cant seemto get more than 2 bars whereas my clunky blue Linksys gaveme a consistent 3 bars
##I purchased and installed the Amped 150repeater and now can get full bars on my laptop across the street
##However,the Amped installs as another network but the range isfantastic
##Iam very pleased with this router as it has given me noproblems except for the poor range
[t] Great router upgrade
##Great replacement for my failing wireless router
##I have not gotten too into the nitty gritty regarding shareport or advanced setups, but it spits that magical wireless signal to my devices without issue
##Easy to setup out of the box
##Easy to use setup web page to check and alter settings
##Upgrading the firmware unfortunately lost most of my settings, which was more of a hassle than an issue as I had fully set everything up prior to updating the firmware
##No issues with wireless or wired connections in about a month of use now
[t] fast while it worked...
##The router I got was defective
internet[@],speed[@]##It was really fast while it was operational but it would shut down and lock up every 5-10 minutes so I had to return it but setup was easy and it really took advantage of my internet speed better than my old wrt54g router
##If it wasn't defective I'm sure I would have been pleased
[t] Perfect solution
##I needed a simple, but reliable replacement for my old WRT54G
##I was looking for better range and wide compatibility for my existing devices
##I have everything from 802
##11b - 802
##11n in the house
##I also wanted a device that was intuitive to install and setup
price[@]##And of course I wanted this for a great price
##The DIR-615 was recommended to me, but I spotted this on Amazon and grabbed it up
##The install took all of 5 minutes
port[@]##Adding my port forwards and MAC addresses too another 30 minutes
##The unit is in my below ground basement so antenna configuration and signal strength is a key measure
##I now have solid connections where the old 54G would drop out on the 1st floor
##I can even now travel to my back yard, some 50 feet away and above ground while still video conferencing on Skype
##I could barely hold a router connection previously
##The QOS feature seems to work well
##I watch it adapt internally to streams such as Slingmedia or Skype
##Remote administration is easy and clean
##All in all a solid bang for the home or SOHO buck
[t] A really fast (rebooting) router
##I went with this router due to my past experience with D-Link
##I hooked up the router, made quick work of the configuration and was up and running in no time
##The only problem is that it would NEVER stay up
##I called D-Link numerous times and received numerous different excuses and ways of fixing the issue
##I tried them all without luck and finally had to return it to Amazon
##The issues seems to be a problem with heat, but I even put a fan on it with no good results
##The router either rebooted/restarted every hour or so or it just went off line
##Thanks to Amazon's great customer support for letting me return it and get something else that actually works
[t] Buyer Beware
##I had this router (the DIR_655 )and liked it fine for more than a year
##Upgraded to firmware 1
##3X which cannot be downgraded
##The router then kept connections open that were expired
##Over a couple of days, those open expired sessions bogged the router down to an unusable state
##Couldn't even log into the router over http
##I did a song and dance with online support several times but they were ineffectual at solving the problem -- no solution after 3 months of replys from me
##They even got snarky and asked me to give them the reason that I upgraded the firmware -- as if it were my fault for upgrading
##I went to other online sources of info and discovered that the firmware issue is rampant with a large chunk of their routers
##My final solution, no thanks to D-Link, was to flash my router with the Russian version of the firmware and then downgrade to the version of North American firmware that worked for me -- 1
##21
##I will never trust a product from DLink again
##They've lost any brand loyalty from me that they had built up
[t] Wireless Router
##This is the first wireless router I've bought that I didn't have problems with
##I went through 3 different brands before I bought this one and had problems with the others
##This router was easy to set up and work with and I have not had one problem with it in the 2 years that I've owned it
##Since I've owned it we have lost electricity 3 times, being out 4 to 7 days each time due to ice storms
##Each time the electricity came back on my wireless router started working immediately and never lost any settings and I never had to do anything to it to get it working again
##I have never had to reset it whereas the other routers I had I was constantly resetting them
##It also has a good range on it
##I can sit out on our deck in the summer time and get a great connection
internet[@][u],speed[@]##My husband and I can both be one the  downloading things and not see any reduction in speed
##I have been extremely happy with the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router and would recommend it
[t] D-Link Dir655
##I purchased this unit as a replacement for a Belkin Wireless router that was incompatible with my Blu-Ray DVD player
internet[@],streaming[@][u]##After I installed the D-Link router, I was able to receive  video and connect the Blu-ray to the internet (seems like a common problem for Samsung units
##)Only issue I have had recently is intermittent loss of connectivity
##I replaced the connecting CAT 5 wires with CAT 6 and the problem so far seems to be corrected, so this unit may be more reliable with CAT 6 that CAT 5 wires
##Would recommend this unit
##Security set up is aesier and also if you would like to experiment with QoS, this unit has some great features that allow easy set up
[t] Not the cheapest but definitely worth the price
##I bought this router to replace an old but faithful US Robotics model
##My needs had already outgrown the USR capabilities
security[@]##The D-Link DIR-655 offered an extensive choice for security and connectivity options that met my needs
##After reading the outstanding reviews here I decided to go ahead and give it a try
security[@][u]##The set-up was very fast for the average  settings
security[@]##If you like me like a bit more security and your needs require advance settings, the time will be a bit more
##I encountered an error that seemed to be browser related, and although I have not yet tried the customer support suggestion to try a different browser, everything is just wonderful
##The range is fantastic
##I own a two floor home and my router is placed on the second floor
speed[@]##I had a problem with the signal especially for my PS3 that is of course enclosed inside a cabinet and this had an impact on the connection that affects both speed and signal
speed[@]##The signal and speed both are now considerably better (7
##0 mbps vs
##2
##0 mbps speed)
##As you know there will be no product that will satisfy everyone, and am sure even this one will have its limitations to some
##I highly recommend this D-Link DIR-655 router
[t] Not reliable..frequent disconnects
##Finally had to buy a Linksys N router to replace this one
##Have a dell desktop and a sony laptop, and was experiencing frequent disconnects every day
internet[@]##Searched the internet and played around with lots of admin settings, but it didn't fix the issue
internet[@]##Found similar issues all over the internet for this model
##I am surprised as to how did this model get such good reviews at the 1st place (avg
##4 stars)
##Didn't bother calling customer support as I read very bad reviews about it too
##Bought a linksys N router, and haven't got a single issue till then
##It's been more than 2 weeks now, and not a single disconnect so far
##Very happy with it
##Overall my experience with linksys has been better than dlink
[t] Happy so far
##I'm happy with this router so far
##It doesn't have the heat problem like other users mentioned
##I got my router from Amazon shipped with firmware 1
##21
##Make sure you do not upgrade it to firmware 1
##3x
##A lot of users are having problems with the new firmware and it's not downgradable
[t] Nice wireless N router
##I upgraded from an old Linksys Wireless G router and it took me about 10 minutes to setup and start surfing the web
internet[@]##The written instructions are somewhat unclear in that they want a computer that has access to the internet during the install
##This is somewhat misleading because your computer will lose access once the old router is removed from the setup
##So, I left my computer running and replaced my old router with the new one
##I ran the quick configuration tool via the CD that is included
##It will later ask you to unplug power from the cable modem, run some setup and then ask you to plug the power back in
##I believe I had the power to the new router ON the entire setup process
##During the setup you will need to pick a router password and SSID
security[@]##I chose WPA security and let it pick the security key
##At the end, the setup will generate a text file called Network Security Settings and place it on your desktop (in case you didn't write down the info earlier)
##I get very good wireless signal thru out my house
##I paired this router with the Dlink DAP-1522 (configured as a bridge) which I setup afterwards
##My setup
[t] Great router with great features, but setup could be better...
##Overall, I'm very pleased with this router
##This is my second D-Link product and I'm very pleased
##However, I found that by using the setup disc, I couldn't set the router to use WPA-2 security, only WPA
speed[@]##Not that in itself is a deal-breaker, but it only allowed for 54 mbps connection speed on my 802
##11N capable HP laptop internal Intel WiFi card
##The online emulator for this model did not work for me - I could change the values to the setting I wanted, but it did not allow me to save them
##Stuff like this BUGS the hell out of me!A call to their free under warranty service line got me a free phone call to India (most likely)
##They pretty much blamed the WiFi card, some something other than the router
##No help here
##Finally, I figured it out
##I upgraded my operating system to Windows 7 home premium
security[@]##I thought, "Let me just use the router without security and see if that helps
internet[@]##" Under Windows 7 when you click an unsecured internet access point, a window pops up and asks you if you want to set up the router
##Nice! In less steps and a quarter of the time it took to use the included CD, I not only was done with configuring the router with WPA-2 security, but I was moving along at 130 mbps!I don't necessarily need any other feature right now, so for now I'm happy with what I'm getting
##Now I can cross this chore off my list and go enjoy the New Year's festivities tonight!
[t] Review of D-Link DIR-655 (I know, a real original title...)
##D-Link Xtreme N Gigabit Router DIR-655 - Wireless router + 4-port switch - EN, Fast EN, Gigabit EN, 802
##11b, 802
##11g, 802
##11n (draft)I purchased this Wireless router for use in my New basement apartment
##So far, it has performed admirably
##I have not had to restart / reset the unit in over a month of operation
##The Interface is relatively easy to use, and I had no issues setting up an encrypted wireless network
##The Gigabit switch is a definite plus over some competing products
##Overall, I am quite satisfied and would have no problems recommending this router to my friends and family
[t] Everything I wanted from a router
##Before this router I had a Linksys WRT54G running custom DD-WRT firmware for three years
##The router eventually gave up after lots of peer-to-peer traffic, and I chose the D-Link DIR-655 to replace it
##Setup for the D-Link was absolutely basic
##The web configuration interface is extensive and easy to understand
##I was up and running in about five minutes out of the box
port[@]##There are a couple of annoying screens, such as the static list of 50 or whatever port forwarding rules, but most of the interface is top notch
streaming[@][u]##As far as performance goes, the D-Link now has an uptime of one month, since I got it, and has successfully hosted multiple wireless laptops, peer-to-peer traffic,  of video from Netflix, online gaming, all without a hiccup
##The range is excellent, too
##I live on the fourth floor of an apartment building and my iPhone will stay connected and working as I walk down the stairs (through a couple of walls from the router) to the outside, and then as I walk around the building
##Nice to have full connection when I am walking the dogs
[t] Router stops working all the time.
##This router stops working all the time
##The longest I've gone is 2 days without needing a reset, most days it stops working withing 2 hours
##You can't fix the problem by resetting the router, the only way to fix it is to reboot the computer
##I've been trying to play Left 4 Dead for 2 hours so far tonight and I'm on my 3rd reboot
##This is just unacceptable and it's going back to amazon
[t] Reliable! No downtime! Wonderful!
##I bought this 6 months ago and I thank myself everyday that I did
##My previous D-Link router suffered from the constant downtime problem where the router had to be reset every so often, which is a really annoying issue if you have ever experienced it
##I guess what I wanted most out of a router was reliability and I found it with this one
##It's set it and forget it
##I haven't had to reboot it once
##It has handled a large home network with 2 desktops, 3 laptops, a Wii, a Xbox 360, and 2 PS3s with total ease
[t] Highly configurable, very fast
##Pro's1 Very, very fast
##2
internet[@]##Highly configurable with some "wizard" configuration features which work well enough; such as obtaining internet connectivity
##3
price[@]##Reasonable price
##Cons1
##Highly configurable; to get the ideal settings, however, requires some knowledge the options
##2
##Runs pretty warm
##3
##Doesn't like being turned off and may lose settings if powered down
##(settings can be saved to a file and easily reloaded from the tools submenu/system/save to local drive or restore)
##4
##The manual doesn't cover all the features of the router and some instructions are left out while others in the manual don't exist in the firmware
##Configuration
[t] Effortless setup
software[@]##Set up to MAC Leopard simple, no need to use enclosed software
##Also connected to PC with no trouble
##Highly recommend for easy of use and functionality
[t] Great Router
##This router is extremely fast and has a great range
internet[@]##We have 11 guys hooked up to this router with great internet speeds
##We were having problems with our linksys wireless-g (went through 2 linksys routers in 2 years) and decided to try D-Link
##So far I have been very impressed
##Hopefully we dont have to replace this one after a year
[t] Another Excellent Router by D-Link
installation[@]##Very easy installation and configuration
security[@]##I'm not a network expert but I was able to set both the wire and wireless connections quite easily with the wizards and documentation and even turn wireless security on in no-time
##Connecting to the wireless network with my laptop proved quite painless and simple - even after trying for the first time connecting to a WPA2 secured wireless network with a WiFi enabled smartphone!The signal is very strong and I'm able to easily connect from every spot in my house and yard though the router resides at a back room
##I've been running this router for a few months now where a bunch of house guests have connected to it (if I were more paranoid I would be quite alarmed at the number of individuals having the password to my wireless network!) - and never had any issues connecting and maintainig a connection
##This router has so many feature and customization options as well
##Worth every cent!
[t] Exceeded Expectations
##This review is aimed at enthusiasts or experts interested in upgrading the quality of their home / small office network overall
##See other reviews for discussion of this router's wireless-N feature
##I got this router for its Gigabit performance
##In past research, I'd come across reviews casting doubt on the reliability of the D-Link brand, so I'd avoided it
##I got this drive on the confidence of the store rep at CSC here in Toronto
##It's been running for weeks with solid performance
##As expected, all the wired computers on my network can now share drives with data transfers at local rates
##Setup was straightforward
##The unexpected surprise was the extensive and generous control panel
##Its built-in documentation is clearly and accessibly written
##I was previously running the trusty Linksys WRT54G and was pleased with its control features
##This D-Link control panel is more polished, more powerful and provides both broader and finer control
speed[@]##It also serves the control pages at Gigabit speed making performance snappy
##If you're already confident at customizing your own network, this router should meet your requirements
##Even better, if you're a beginning enthusiast looking to learn, this router gives you room to grow in to and includes tools to support you in the process
[t] Reliable
##This would have by me a 5 star rating if really worked out of the box easy and fast
##No complains about the router itself
internet[@][u],speed[@]##I works really good with N, G and B even when mixing all of them at the same time, never drops connection and I didn't loose any  speed comparing to when I just connect a RCA modem from Comcast to my computer by network cable
##The only problem is the Quick Router Setup Wizard
##I ran it in my HP with Vista Home Premium with Service Pack 1
##I tried it first of course, rather than doing the custom setup in the web browser
##But I always got problems when the wizard tests the network adapter in the computer and then tries to reset the network
##I tried everything possible but I always was stopped by an "Invalid IP address" or an "Internal Error" message
internet[@]##Whatever, being a more advanced user like me I didn't loose time trying to call D-Link support and I went straight to the manual setup using the internet browser
##Then finally things ran smooth and really easy
security[@]##I was able to setup my wireless security using WPA2 without any problems and to tweak whatever I wanted like the QOS Engine
##Also I updated the firmware to the latest 1
##20 version
##But I don't believe that updating it would resolve the issue in trying to configure the router by the Wizard CD
##Anyways, I had a some years old D-Link 802
##11b only, which never gave me any any problems by the way
speed[@]##Switching to this one improved my range and also made things like my Nintendo Wii and PS3 to work with Wireless G, improving speed
##For my three notebooks (2 with Vista Home Premium and 1 with XP Home), apart from range improvements and a safer feeling of using WPA2 instead of WEP, I don't fell any other difference
##Using my desktop connected by a network cable to the router things remain just the same as was with the old router
##Overall I'm happy with this purchase
##It's a reliable product and probably one of the best out there to buy, to not say the best (I never tested linksys or belkin, but I don't see why they would be better)
##My only concern is only for non-advanced users
##If people gets in trouble with the Wizard, as I can see by the reviews that very often they get, calling D-Link or asking help for someone with knowledge will be unavoidable
##That's why I took out one of the rating stars
##I will update my review as
[t] sathya
##This router performs very good
streaming[@][u]##I had netgear previously and experienced very often the performance issues during the 
streaming[@]##But for the streaming while using the internet, this Dlink 655 is one of the best to do
##So far it is good(since from 11/28/11)
##The coverage is very good also
##I can update after observing the performance in another 3 months
##sathya
[t] replaces Linksys
##Just installed it
##So far so good
##Setup could have been smoother
##I probably should have just done a manual setup
security[@]##The setup program insisted I use WPA security
##That would have required putting new passwords in 6 different devices in the house and requiring visiting relatives to change the passwords
security[@]##So I went with the "automatic" setup and then manually accessed the router to switch to WEP security
##Range seems about the same as the Linksys router, but range was not a problem with it
##Dependability was
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##Although not too happy about a white unit, the 655 has exceeded my expectations
##I did a manual install because I like to control all the settings
##Went very smooth indeed! I have the unit setup behind a DSL-2540B modem/router and basically have it functioning as an access point for wireless use
port[@]##Now I have two switch ports free on the 2540B(port 1 for the 655 and port 2 for my full tower) and all four ports free on the 655
price[@]##Thinking I should have gone with the dual band unit but I have not had any problems with the 655 and my home phone system running at the same frequency! Would recommend this unit and the price is very good for what you get!
[t] Solid Wireless Router
##I bought this for setting up my folks house with Wi-Fi
##This is in my opinion the best and, most reliable router out there
##Their are some with more features,faster etc but, being Solid is priceless
##If you want to set up a router/wi-fi/network and don't want the problems of drops/loss of signal or troubles then this is the one for you!! This is the same one i have in my house and i have 1 custom computer, 1 imac,2 laptops,2 ipad2,1 laserprinter, and 2 inkjet printers on it
##I also have my 55 inch sony HDTV and 3d Blu-ray player as well as an xbox 360/playstation 3 running all on this router
##As always with Amazon shipping was fast and hassle free
[t] Was hoping for a little more speed, but didn't get it
##Was hoping for a little more speed, but didn't get it
##Speed is the same as last router
##It works well, but was a little harder to network than expected
##I did enjoy doing away with a hub & it takes up less space than my last router
internet[@]##Only wish it would have made sharing the internet with my son easier
##He is bit of an broadband hog
[t] Great range router!
##we have this router working in the office and it is a workhorse
##Guest zone option and excellent range for wifi
##Definitely would recommend this product
[t] Not good enough
##I was replacing my linksys wireless-g because it would reset too often
##I disliked D-link for 2 big reasons
[t] Nice router overall
##I was nervous about buying it ,because of some of the bad reviews
##Overall not to bad
##Regular web surfing and playing average games it works fine
##Maybe it's time for me to buy a new modem
##I noticed that it is a slow at downloading
##I went to d-link's website to see if I could upgrade the firmware ,but it already has the latest version
speed[@]##I don't see any real difference in speed
##Upgrading from a D-Link Dir 601, I was expecting faster speeds
##So far so good , it had a some drops in this month of December ,but went away
##Netflix on PS3 drops connection constantly, maybe I just got a bad PS3
##I'm not here to complain about this router it , nothing is going to be perfect in life
##This is my second one the first I bought three years ago was an A version and it went bad after 3 days
##This one is the B version
##I am happy with it
[t] Great Upgrade
##D-Link router is an upgrade from an earlier version
##Needed additional signal strength to reach across the house
antennas[@][u]##Best part is that the  are detachable enabiling flexability in antenna selection for even better trans/rec signal
##So far all D-Link hardware work out of the box with no problems and good instructions
[t] Perfect!
##I purchased this to extend the range of my home network, not much more than that
##It did that and then some! Some hiccups during the setup, but after that it functions perfectly!
[t] I Got A Faulty One - Awful Customer Service
##I've read alot of hit or miss reviews of this unit
##Alot of the bad reviews seem to be based on sudden, random loss of connection (on both wired and wireless connections)
##And this is the exact problem I've got with my DIR-655, which I've had for over a month now
##And this week, the problems seem to be getting worse
internet[@]##I'll have three hours of no problems, then suddenly for the next two hours, I'll randomly lose internet access on both my wireless and wired connections
##I have a baby monitor in the house that could cause interference, but even with that unplugged, I still have the same problems
##I've tried different channels, upgraded the firmware to 2
##01NA, toggled QoS and traffic sharing on/off and a whole host of tweaks
##and I still have the same connectivity issues
##I've plugged my 5 year old Linksys back in temporarily, and that has had no problems thus far
##I'm beyond my 30-day return period, so I'm stuck dealing with D-Link customer service, which is a nightmare
##I know the unit is faulty, they need to take it and send me one that works
##Yet, they just want to keep trying things I've already done to troubleshoot it
##I called them 3 times yesterday, each time, they took me thru some different tweak
##then told me to call back if I continue to have problems
##The last lady, who was the most difficult to understand over the phone, seemed irked that I called three times in 3 hours and instead told me to call back "in a few days and not a few hours, if you continue to have problems
##and we will then try a more advanced configuration"
##Advanced configuration? Really? So, even though I'm still having problems now and loss of connectivity
##they want me to deal with it for the next couple days and then call back and complain again about how I need to send this unit to them, but they'll just tell me to do one more tweak and call back again in a few more days
##Bottom line, judging by the reviews
##it seems like a fine router if you get one that's not defective
##It does appear that, in some instances, this router may need to be tweaked in order to work
##which simply means, you may need to be pretty techy in order to understand what you need to do
##But if you happen to get a faulty one that randomly loses connection
##make sure you return it within 30 days or whatever the return policy is! Because, you really don't want to deal with their customer service
[t] Great Gigabit Router
##This is a very nice gigabit router; I have Verizon DSL and had no issues setting it up
##The wireless reception is great and I would recommend to anyone
[t] Needs to be renamed F-link because it fails
internet[@]##2 months into it and its dropping the internet connection on the wired ports, have to remove power to boot router to get momentary connection back so I could write this review and find a new reliable Netgear router to replace the DIG-655 F-Link/No-link router
[t] Should have paid attention to the bad reviews.
##I should have listened more closely to the bad reviews regarding reception
##The wireless function to all my household laptops was terrible, dropping out and not being able to hook up to the router about every half hour
##I liked all the features but this issue made it impossible to keep
[t] BAD ROUTER, ROTTEN CUSTOMER SERVICE
##I had a SUPER little BELKIN router
##STUPID ME I changed it to the D-link DIR 655 router
##It worked at first but would drop my Netflex network
##Well I had it for 2 months now and it is down
##Called D-link they kept blaming it on EVERYTHING ELSE
##SO I contacted my service provider They came out 3 times to check my connections, found nothing I contacted the computer manufacture they spent 2 hours checking out their computer
##I must say Dell techs are the nices guys
##All thru this I had contacted D-link about 3 or 4 times doing what they told me to do
##I FINALLY isolated the problem to my 2 month old D-link DRI 655 Router
##SO this last Saturday I called them at 4
[t] Terrible Product
##This router was recommended to me by a friend, and since it had almost 2,000 reviews with a 4-star average, I decided to give it a try
##WORST ROUTER EVER
##I have had nothing but problems since I first set it up
##As a Mac user, the manual set-up is a little more difficult, but it's still relatively easy, so that was initially encouraging
internet[@]##Ever since then, my roommate and I have had to reset it at least twice a day (there are absolutely no problems with the internet connection)
##Although it works very well, it needs to be reset so often that it's not worth it
##Do not buy this product!
[t] D Link DIR-655
##We received this item last Friday & I put off installing until today as I remembered how difficult the last D Link 614+ was to install years ago
##My how times have changed, for the better !With my trusty assistant by my side, we were finished the install in no time at all
##What a pleasure it was
##So far the 655 is preforming as it was designed
port[@]##But, we are looking for the specific info on how to use the USB port for printer sharing & have not found anything yet
##Will look more later as we have had enough mental exercise for one day
##Buy it, install it & you will love it !!
[t] Better wireless Security was my main concern
##My buddy recommended this
##He had to walk me through it a bit but it is up and going
##I like the way it can protect you home wireless system from intrusions over my other brand router I was using
##It sure saves of desktop space!
[t] Great Router!
##This is a great router that I connected to the modem from time warner
##Signal is very stable and it really reaches far
##Connection is stable and data transmission is faster compared to my old router
##I encountered some problems installing it since a previous router is still connected to my PC
installation[@][u]##After turning the old router off,  went by easy
##I'm very satisfied with this router and highly recommend it
[t] Loved it
##Loved it
##Works great and has a very good range and signal strength
##Other reviews stated that the unit heated up - this is not the case with the unit I received
[t] Just what I needed
##We had 4 laptops in the house and we were usually all on at the same time and the int went very fast
##Works great
[t] Good while it lasted...
##Ownership Experience
[t] Pretty darn good!
##Great product
##It's my second router of this same model - one for home and the other for business
##Works well, no problems
security[@]##Only minor difficulties with set up instructions, but the customer service was great in helping me figure out setting up the security options
##I would highly recommend this product
[t] Serves Our Household Well
##We have two of these units
##One would not do in our household because it couldn't reach all the way across the house wirelessly and keep a strong signal
##So we've set them up "cascading", which the tech reps at D-link walked me through
##From time to time (every couple of months or so) we lose our connection (through the router, not the modem) and I reset the entire system
##It's not something a novice may want to deal with, but tech support with D-link is good
##I suggest any time you have them walk you through something, take detailed notes
##If you have to repeat the procedure later, you can go back to your notes rather than having to call
[t] Great product.
##Better range than my old dir625 range booster
speed[@]##Excellent speed
##Easy to setup
##Only con would be the blue LEDs
##The green ones fom my old router were more discrete
##Would bother if it stays inside your bedroom or is visible from your bed
##Lights are excessivelly bright for the night
##Other than that it has no defects
##Makes non wireless printers into wireless ones
##Very very good
[t] Love It
##It is great, I've never had a problem with it
##Its easy to set up, and easy to use
##It looks nice and it barely takes up any space
##I love it and I would recommend it to everyone
[t] Poor insructions and/or defective unit
##This item was returned as unusable
##After many hours of attempting setup finally gave up
##(I have set up several routers previously, with no problems
##) Just set up a Trendnet similar router in about 20 minutes with no problems and it works perfectly!
[t] D-Link
##The router behaves as expected
##What makes it excell is D Link support
##They responded within 6 hours of a request for technical assistance
##I don't think any other company can say the same thing! For this reason I remain a loyal D-LINK CUSTOMER!!!
[t] Range is not much
##I bought this wireless router to extend the WiFi service to the edge of my property (1/2 Acre
antennas[@]##Even with 3 6dB antennas I couldn't get the router to transmit over 50 feet
##I consider myself a little bit savvy with electronics so now I'm looking options on how to extend the signal
security[@]##Other than that is was quite easy to setup and I like the security features and the web interface
streaming[@]##I'm not giving up on the purchase because the streaming of video was important to me over 802
##11n
##BTW back end is attached to Comcast Cable modem service
[t] D-Link extreme router
##I have been using this router for eight months and it has been working well
##The setup was fairly easy, the range is acceptable, and it hasn't given me any problems
##I do recommend this item
[t] Great not Perfect
##Performance is top notch
##Worked right out of the box
##I had a linksys wi fi a, b, g, clearly the range had increased
##Just afraid of upgrading firmware because of all the stories on the web
[t] Very upset from Amazon
price[@]##I don't like to buy an item then in less than a week the price drops and I don't get compensated!!!The device is still brand new in its original package, very bad policy!!!
[t] D-Link DIR 655
##I was just upgrading from a Trendnet wireless router
##But unfortunately, this one does not work out of box
installation[@]##So I had to return this one back and purchased another Linksys E1000, which worked immediately after very-easy installation
##The only one star is to give Amazon's excellent service, and ZERO star should rate this product
##So, highly NOT recommend this product to anyone who would like to have a home wireless network
##Keep away from this junk and save your money and time
[t] 64 digit password
##I put the disk in to set up, McAfee saw a Trojan on the setup cd would not let it download it was called Artemis!E92350CBAED0
##after a little study I figured to sent the unit back
##then a friend told me to just plug the unit in
##Windows started to install the unit with drivers that were available but it was still not working right so I put the CD
[t] Leave it in the box. Buy a Linksys instead.
##Could not get a connection to last for more then 5 minutes
##Bad receiption
##Bad unit
[t] D-Link 655
##I am very disappointed in the range of this wireless product
speed[@]##My old router (G) had a much better range and speed
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##Piece of junk
##Poor range
##Could get only one of my three laptops to connect
##Returned it
[t] A bit too pricy
price[@]##Nice router, but the price is just a bit too high
##I would say go for a cheaper one
[t] Have ATandT/yahoo DSL? DO NOT BUY THIS!
##This company in their infinite wisdom gave this unit the SAME address as the common ATandT yahoo modem
##To correct this problem hook up the modem with the router and sign on to the internet, but wait
##they dont work together because of the conflict
##You therefore cant sign on with them hooked up to correct the problem
##Does this sound circular? There is a customer support line for you to call LONG DISTANCE and be on hold for half an hour or better at YOUR expense
##There you get someone that has learned a years worth of ENGLISH from a book so cant understand what you are saying
##After several minutes of them not being able to understand your questions, they drop connection
##You can either get BACK in the customer support line
##on hold
##long distance at YOUR expense, or throw the item in the trash
##Please dont waste your money
##Before you buy ANY router, please go to its support page
##See if your DSL provider is listed there with NUMEROUS complaints
##Though to be fair, I can understand how small the company AT and T is and therefore why THIS company hasnt bothered to put out a product that does not conflict
##Also be aware that their web site has BLATENTLY written "We give NO refunds for ANY reason"
##Now if this unit were NOT such a problem why would they NEED to write that! Please ignore the GLOWING reviews written by employees of this company and go see their web page for yourself
##BEWARE! The company doesnt give refunds so Im essentially throwing over a hundred bucks in the trash
##Wanna join me or you wanna pass this by?
[t] Do NOT buy this router
##I own a Linksys WRT-100 router for our home business
##All of our computers are capable of Gigabit connections, so I figured it was time to "upgrade
##" Like many of us, I've grown weary of Linksys and their forever outsourcing "service" to India and other points west
##Actually, my last conversation was with a very polite young lady in Manila, but, what the hey! When I finally had the WRT-100 set correctly, it hasn't missed a beat apart from the missing gigabit routine
##Enter the highly reviewed DIR=655 from D-link
##Man, was I excited to open this puppy up and get 'er going
##That's were the problems begin
##The installer assumes (remember the spelling of this word) that the whole word operates from a DSL modem
##I don't
##Do you? Anyway, for me this was a spiral down hill to hell
##The installer is beyond slow, and I have absolutely no idea what it's doing for all that time
##Now I must admit that my wired connections worked correctly and well
##But the wireless part, OMG!!My other computers could not connect with the access point regardless of what I tried, and I tried just about everything I could imagine
##I read the manual, twice
##I called
##I wrote
##I sat a watched in horror as my wife's "accountant" computer couldn't connect!Guys, do you run a home business? Does you wife to the books? (yea, I know, silly question)
##Well, if she does, and you want any sleep whatsoever, PLEASE don't buy this thing
##Just stick with Linksys
##Yea, I know how badly they suck at a lot of things, but the interface is really nice, and my other (in the past) linksys stuff + my current one just worked
##What more can I say?
[t] Good value ...
##I am typically of the "if it's not broke, don't fix it" mindset but it was time to replace my 10-year old router
##Since it was a D-Link and had worked flawlessly for this long it made sense to go with another D-Link product
##I use MAC filtering so I opted for manual setup
##Very straightforward process, I had the router up and running within 15-20 minutes
speed[@]##Both wireless speed and range have noticably improved; my router is in my second floor office while laptops tend to be all over the house, primarily on the first floor
##My Xbox console is also on the first floor, I installed the Microsoft "N" adapter on the console at the same time and was up and running within minutes
##Too early to rate reliability but if my previous experience is any indication I look forward to many years of service from this product
##BTW, I leave the unit on 24/7 and have had no heat issues
[t] When 4 other routers failed - This router WORKS !
##It all began when I received a blu-ray player that instantly streams movies from Netflix
##I began the search for a router and or modem to improve my wireless quality (G)
##I gave up on my DSL and installed cable
speed[@]##I increased my speed from 5 to 10
##I tried new USB adapters (3)
##I will spare you the agonizing story but I will say that I tried several routers Netgear Rangemax (G) and (N), LinkSystems (G), Verizon (G), and a generic unit and all of them deteriorated the wireless signal OR quality (sometimes both)
##Speed tests were showing that I was getting 3-5 on the laptops
speed[@][u]##BestBuy just kept selling me new things, tech support (for various companies)didn't care as long as the  was good when I was plugged into the router
##I got a strong signal plugged into the router but my wireless sucked
##I finally found a blog online with other people that had the same problem
##They seemed to have resolved it with this D-Link Exteme N Dual Band Wireless Router
speed[@]##I purchased this last night and last night my husband's laptop did a speed test he gets between 17 and 23 ! Unbelievable
##His laptop (at the other end of the house) can instantly stream movies and does not pause at all
##He's never been able to do that
##If there is anyone out there that has thrown up their hands in frusteration - dont give up, buy this product
[t] Easy set-up, Seems really fast
##I'll weigh in on the positive side for this unit
##It's been on all day and is cool to the touch, so no problem there
##I replaced an existing netgear G router and it's noticeably faster
##Used the standard interface (192
##168
##0
##1) to configure
##I'm not particularly technical but had no problems
##Just got it today, but it seems to be working fine
##It arrived with the 1
##32NA firmware already installed, so I was prepared for some of the problems that have been reported, but so far, so good
##1/21/2010 update
[t] Great router. I am pleased.
##I've purchased this router because of good review
##The router is easy to setup
speed[@]##The speed and coverage are great
##I'm pleased
[t] A Fine Choice for a Router
##The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N wireless router was just what we had hoped for after reading other reviews
##It was easy to set up to replace our two-year old G router from D-Link, and now our connectivity is much stronger throughout the house
##The laptop works just fine even in the backyard about 80 feet from the router
##No failures to connect and no dropped signals any longer
##So far there has been no need to reset the router or contact customer support
##The improvement was very noticeable even with the one-year old laptop that has a G-rated wireless card
##So there is no question that the router is backward compatible
[t] Horrible Tech Support
##Purchased this unit because of the ratings on Amazon
##com
##However, I wasn't able to get the unit setup and after 15 attempts I called tech support
##Unfortunately, I couldn't understand the tech support people
##As an ICU nurse I have worked with doctors from all over the world but I couldn't understand the tech support people in India
##The accent was so thick and the phone connection was so bad that I finally gave up calling after three times and sent the unit back
##I then purchased another unit from Embarq/CenturyLink and had to call their tech support
##Fortunately, they where located in the US and the problem was finally solved
[t] Compared to netgear rangemax....
##The amazon order/shipping experience was excellent as always
##I ordered this router to replace a 2yo rangemax that had suddenly started randomly losing connections, which i've since learned is a commonly noted problem with rangemax
##However, for a specific case of connecting with a wireless xbox 40' away with 802
##11g and through 5 layers of walls and a floor, the signal strength is poor compared to the rangemax which is average according to the strength bars noted on the xbox, and sometimes drops altogether
##I'm exchanging for another rangemax that will hopefully last another 2 years
##The dir-655 may for many people be the perfect solution, but for me it is not
[t] Works great and does what you expect
##the signal is definitely strong and reliable
##I have many wireless in the area and I haven't had any drop or lose of signal
##I did have occasionally some of those issues with the previous model DIR-615
##If you have FIOS it will not work in AUTO mode (10/100/1000) out of the box and mostly it's a Verizon issue
internet[@]##I had to deal for a few days on the phone to convince Verizon that the issue was on their side and internet isfull of people reporting the same issue
##That's the only mini snafu that I noticed for everything else it's a goodunit and I'm happy about it
[t] Not computer savvy but was easy for me
##I'm not very electronics-comfortable and was intimidated about setting this up the first time
##It was simple and painless, and making it private (needing to enter a password for computer access) was very simple
##It worked immediately and has worked very well for the four weeks I have had it
##whew
##It was installed in our basement office and the connection is great from the upper floors
[t] Extremely Happy with D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Router
##Deciding on the "perfect" router was a decision that I did not make lightly
##I made this decision after reading as much technical info that left me more confused than informed, and then consulting with my son-in-law who is a computer wiz
security[@]##He recommended this router without qualification, stating it would be a router that we would never outgrow because of its speed, features, and security
##After comparing it with top-notch routers on the market, feature for feature, it was clear that the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N suited our needs perfectly
##We have not been disappointed
##It was very easy to install and its performance has been flawless
price[@]##The Amazon price could not be beat!
[t] Router kind of works, unbelieveably TERRIBLE tech support
##This was a great learning experience
##My new take on the "Amazon Star" rating process is to calculate ratio of low rating (1 or 2 stars) to the overall number of ratings and that will give you the percentage chance of having a bad experience with a product
##Unfortunately, I fell into the 30% of the people that have had bad experience with this product
##The real question for you as you're thinking about buying this product is "do I feel lucky or will I be the approximately 1 out of 3 people who get unlucky?"
##Some people like to gamble with hours of time on hold with tech support
##Turns out I don't
##I purchased this router to replace my Linksys wrt54gx
##I have a network with 3 laptops and 5 other computers that worked fine (each computer can see the other) before installing the Dlink DIR 655
internet[@]##After installing the DLink and working for about an hour, I was finally able to get each individual computer to see the internet
##Unfortnately, none of the computers could see each other, nor even respond to simple ping commands
##Tech support calls went like this
[t] D-Link is a HORRIBLE company
##Bought the DIR-655 brand new and had to return it to D-Link 3 times before I received a unit that actually worked
##All of the dysfunctional units put themselves into an endless loop of reboot, rendering the unit dysfunctional
##This generally occurred after working for 4-5 hours
##After leaving the product unplugged for a couple of hours, you'd be able to get another 4-5 hours of use before having to repeat the unplug cycle
##Compounding that problem
##D-LINK CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST EVER!!! My combined total time spent on hold with D-Link was well over 4 hours
##You talk with someone briefly (generally to retell your situation for the umteenth time because they are too lazy to look at the problem ticket), then off to transfer land where you get another prolonged hold time before you reach the next incompetent technician
##AVOID D-LINK
##they are horrible!!!!!!
[t] Works with Tivo, Wii (and PCs)
##I ordered this because my old router was dying
##I have an older Tivo, which runs only 802
##11B and a Ninetndo Wii (802
##11G) in addition to two standard PC wireless connections (and a couple of wired ones)
security[@]##I had to dial back the wireless security in order to bring my Tivo along, which locked the router into only B/G function, but the signal strength is great and there have been no "legacy" issues at all
##Color me quite happy
[t] VOIP & Power users look elsewhere
##Review target audience
[t] Excellent router
##I bought this router after buying a MacBook Pro which has built-in 802
##11n capability (after buying the n "enabler" from Apple for $2)
speed[@]##I wanted to take advantage of the fast wireless speed as well as the gigabit Ethernet interface on the MacBook Pro
##Oddly, Apple's much more expensive Airport with draft n capability does not have a gigabit Ethernet interface, so the D-Link Extreme N seemed like a good choice as it had all I was looking for
##This product did not disappoint
speed[@]##I got all of the speed I was looking for plus the extra range I needed for a difficult spot where I needed the signal to go through two cinderblock walls
##It also gets a stronger signal to two floors above the router location
##Configuration was easy and the router has been very stable for the several weeks I have been using it
##I particularly like the detailed status and logging information
##On the wireless side, I'm currently using the router in a mixed g and n setup
##I had some reliable wireless b cards that I would have continued using, but there was a problem
##Security is not a major concern in my location, so I would have continued using WEP except that it is not supported in the draft wireless n standard
##I moved to some D-Link g cards that were on sale and they perform very well and I can now use both WPA and WPA2 simultaneously with this router
##Mixing b with n would probably seriously degrade the n performance anyway
##As it stands now, my wireless n performance is excellent where the signal strength is strong
speed[@]##My Internet download speed is typically close to 27 mbps on a wired connection and I get the same real throughput on the n wireless
##Even g does not do that in a real Internet benchmark
##The router comes with a cat5 cable which should not be used for a gigabit connection, so be sure to purchase any cat6 cables you need as I did
##I also purchased an Intel gigabit Ethernet card for my Windows PC to enable fast transfers with the Mac
##I upgraded the router firmware a few days ago and it works fine, but the only problem was that it would not load my saved configuration, so I had to input my custom settings again
##This was an annoyance, but also a flaw that I saw with my old DI-624 router
##There are likely to be more upgrades especially because the n spec has not been finalized
##The wireless n works fine with the Mac
##The other issue to note for Mac users is that the router's web-based configuration application does not seem to work with any of the browsers I have on my Mac, so hopefully you will have access to a Windows PC to do the setup
##(Presumably a Parallels Windows PC on the Mac will work, but I have not tried that yet
##)Bottom line, this is the best consumer router I have used
[t] Horrible, incredibly hard and confusing setup
##I've had a lot of linksys routers and netgear routers which were basically plug and play, so to speak
##No hassele setups
##So when I heard about all the positives on this router I decided to upgrade
##Big mistake! Out of the box, this router did not work at all with my desktop comupter; it was broadcasting a wireless connection for my laptop, but my desktop's connection was completely dead
##After numerous hours of trying to tweak it by both CD install, and both manual installs and checking the Dlink site by rehooking my old router back up, I gave up
##As other reviews note, initial setup can be tricky for this router
##I've had lots of routers in the past and none of them required the amount of tweaking I had to go through and even then, it still didn't work correctly
##Save yourself a big headache and get something else
[t] Powerful control panel
##I agree with the first reviewer in that it is hard to find reviews of this product anywhere online
##After reading lukewarm reviews of other draft-n routers, I picked this one up on a whim, hoping for the best
##I am extremely pleased
##The other D-Link products I own are a mixed bag in terms of level of control in the firmware, with the DGL-4300 being leaps and bounds better than the DI-LB604
##Luckily, the DIR-655 firmware is akin to the DGL-4300 in terms of control, features and flexibility
##It's even a little snappier thanks to fewer graphics and has better Firefox compatibility
##Setup was a breeze (if you know what you're doing, you don't need to insert the CD first as instructed by the unit -- just toss it) and though I haven't had it long connectivity has been stable for the past 24 hours
##I have yet to try a Skype session, but the "intelligent QoS engine" promises improved call quality
##Overall, I'm very satisfied
[t] Nothing Worked Easily ...in the End Wireless Connections Didn't Work
##Nothing worked easily with this Router
##I had set up 4 other wireless networks with Netgear and Linksys
##I followed the instructions very precisely
##Although the router connected to the Internet, it wouldn't pass the connection to the wire connected computer
##After three calls to Dlink Support, they finally figured that I should change the default IP address of the Router
##then it worked
##Next I tried to connect laptops by wireless connection to the router
security[@]##I was able to do so if there was no security on the network
##But if I wanted to run WEP or WPA (which is what I wanted) it wouldn't make a complete connection
##only a limited connection that wouldn't allow me to use the Internet on the laptops
##After spending three hours with Dlink Support, the technician finally got frustrated because nothing she recommended worked
##So she gave me a silly excuse that the Dlink notebook adaptor needed a firmware upgrade
##It didn't
##it had the latest firmware
##By the way, the 655 came with firmware 1
##02
##I upgraded all the way to 1
##11
##but nothing could make this sucker work
##I'm sure it connects flawlessly on many systems
##But on mine nothing worked automatically
##In the end I decided to return it
##My system consisted of several Windows XP computers (all with SP2) and a Vista computer
##The wired computer was an XP
##I have a Siemens DSL modem and ATT DSL
##I think I may have read a post somewhere that this router doesn't work with ATT DSL
##so maybe that was it
##don't know
##Needless to say I went back to my trusty Linksys G router
[t] Best wireless router on the market.
##I first bought the Netgear RangeMax NEXT
##Waste of money
##I was getting 50% signal strength on my laptop from 10 feet away, with no intervening walls
##With the D-Link, I get 99% signal under the same test
##I have the router in an upstairs room, with several desktops in another upstairs room - plus a laptop, Xbox 360, and Wii connecting from downstairs
##All get great signal strength
##It never drops below 45%, and is enough to maintain a 54Mbps data rate using 802
##11g cards
##It's all about the signal strength, and the D-Link delivers
##One slight downside is the admin console
##It's fine for basic tasks, but things like assigning hostnames to MAC addresses could be more intuitive
##I used to do this with a Linksys router, but with the D-Link the best I could manage was to assign fixed IP addresses to MAC addresses, and hostnames to the IP addresses
##Still gets the job done, just not as cleanly
##I highly recommend this product
##Don't buy any other wireless router
[t] Product= very good, support= dismal
##1
##You CANNOT set up this router via a wireless device
##ALL set-up must be done from a WIRED connection
##2
##This unit ships with clear plastic static cling protective covers
##REMOVE THEM or else the unit will overheat (they cover crucial vent holes
##)3
##Use the included stand to put the unit into the vertical position if at all possible
##Again, this improves cooling
##Used with these two caveats
##my unit is cool as a cucumber
##No problemo
##4
##D-link was too cheap to hire a translator/technical writer in order to translate the instructions in the manual or in the set up process to clear English
##As a result, ALL of the instructions are in HIGHLY fractured language
##I think they used one of those free online translation services
##(You get what you pay for
##)The manual provided is NOT "in synch" with the actual settings so you will have to stumble through some things on your own
##The set-up process is not really onerous BUT it's not "plug and play' either
##(Mac users will find this really annoying
##)4
##DO NOT use the set up "Wizard" it just doesn't freakin' work correctly
##Always use the MANUAL settings
##For example, we use Roadrunner from TWC cable
##So for us, we use DHCP to connect
##CHANGE AS FEW SETTINGS AS POSSIBLE
##5
##Use WPA2, Personal encryption
##Use the LOOONNNG 63 character password provided on both the router and any computers that will be connected over a wireless connection
##You only have to enter it once
##Save a print out of it somewhere you won't lose it
##BUT don't worry, once you connect a computer to this router via a WIRED connection, you can EASILY reset the password
##Having gotten this thing set up, it works like a charm
##I've had it for a month and the performance is excellent
##I had to buy it in order to connect a PC laptop which is on the other side of the house, through several walls
##He gets excellent signal strength
speed[@]##The wired Gigabit Ethernet connectivity is OUTSTANDING, just remember to use Cat SIX cable to maintain Gigabit speed
##My Mac Pro is our only device that is Gigabit capable, but that will change over time
##Finally, if this has to be in a bedroom or other living area, put black electrical tape over the STUPID blinking lights which are OBSCENELY bright (and actually, not good for anything, except when something isn't working
##Even then, their diagnostic value is minimal
##)If you are a true nerd, you simply cannot purchase a SOHO router any faster than this one
##(Note
[t] I will be honest; Set-up was rough, but it was a workhorse
##I purchased this router in June of 2009 and figure that now is the time to come clean about my experience with it
##Installation SUCKED and tech support didn't know what to do to fix or how to diagnose it for about a month
##But after they told me the correct setting to change, it worked like a charm
##I was in a two story apartment and my router was in the middle of the unit
##Still got signal from the parking lot
##Not to mention the blue lights go with the rest of my electronics (Worldbook hard drive, Hitachi Touro Pro, Logitech z5500 speakers, and custom built desktop)
##Now to discuss everyone else's problems they had
[t] Awesome
##this router is fantastic
##i recommended it to a friend a mine and he was happy too
##the blue lights look cool as its running in a dark room
speed[@]##once i setup all the features for the best wifi speed i was barely losing 5mbps
[t] WOW!
##Im not all to tech savey yet
internet[@],speed[@]##Thats why I'm going to college! When i plugged this router in, setup was a breeze! Once hooked up to the internet i did a speed test wired and wireless
##Wired
[t] worked great
##Easy setup
##worked on first try
##Blue lights are very bright
##Very happy with the end product
##Works all over 2000 sqft home
[t] Router failed after one year
##I have been frustrated with my past Router experience and did lot of research before I bought this
##I thought I did well when it started working fairly decently until last month
##It started requiring reboots couple of times a day
internet[@]##Now the internet slows down after couple of hours and WiFi signal becomes unavailable after 2-3 hours
##When I tried to reboot, it did not come back live
##I tried to hook it up directly to my laptop and tried to upgrade its firmware
##It became live again and now it disappears after 2-3 hours requiring reboot
##I am very frustrated with all of my router experience and am still looking for the one that works very reliably without any frustration of hourly reboots
##Others have rated it well but please do consider my feedback
##I submitted an online support request and I am yet to hear any
##I was just out of look with its warranty
[t] Doesn't work - even messes up my wired network
##I bought this router to add to my in-house wired network
##Not only was the wireless unreliable (slow then fast, then nothing) it caused my wired connections to not work correctly
##Same issues
##Sending it back and going to try something else
##After reading how bad D-links tech support is and being very familiar with networks I'm not even going to bother trying to figure it out
[t] Great buy
##I bought this router after lots of research on another website
price[@][u]##Amazon had the best  of course
##Does exactly what it is supposed to do
##no issues
##Works great
##I even have a signal outside of my house so I can stream music via wifi as I mow the lawn
[t] Excellent Working Order. Good and Prompt service.
software[@]##It took me a while to get the product software downloaded and the product up and running
software[@]##The cable company service I have is not that great, so I could have used a little more help in the step by step instructions on how to get the software downloaded
[t] Works Great!
speed[@]##Bought two of these (one for Mom) and both work great! It doesn't drop connection, great range and fast speed
[t] Worst experience with a router ever.
##This router was awesome for the first two hours of operation
internet[@]##After that it dropped internet connection every 2-4 hours until I returned it to the seller
##Do more research and find another router!
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless router
##This product initially would not work on my network
software[@]##It was only after I did some WEB searching that I found that I needed a software patch from D-Link to get the router to work with Windows Vista
##After that everything was fine
##I did have to move the unit around to get a good signal throughout my two story house
##Data throughput is very good given that three laptops are always on here
[t] Works fine with Mac OS X
##I'd like to address the previous rant/review
##It took 10 minutes for me to configure this router with my Powerbook G4 running Tiger 10
##4
##9 (fully patched) using Firefox 1
##5
##I didn't experience any issues
##I also connected to the router interface with my Powermac G4 MDD running 10
##4
##9 and Firefox 1
##5 without any issues
##I browsed all the panes since I wanted to check out all the settings and options
##I'm not a fan of Safari so I don't generally use it but I fired it up to test the interface
##I was able to connect and browse the management interface without any problems
##Mileage may vary, but I couldn't duplicate the reported errors
##As for the general review, I'm happy with my purchase
##I moved into a 3 story house last April and had been experiencing wireless connectivity issues with my Aluminum Powerbook and my old SMC wireless router located in my second floor office
##I had limited signal strength on the first and third floors
##There were a couple of 'sweet spots' where I could sometimes get 2-3 bars (roughly 25% signal strength)on either floor
##I was ususally unable to get a strong enough signal to connect
antennas[@][u]##I tried external  from various vendors and experienced the same problems
##My new Xtreme D-Link DIR-655 (using only the built-in antennas) shows full bar strength throughout the entire house
##Air Stumbler showed signal strengths between 50-85% throughout the entire house
##I can even get a 70% signal strenght outside on our third floor deck
##As I stated earlier, configuring the router out of the box only took 10 minutes
##This included MAC address filtering, WPA2, SSID, changing IP settings, configuring DHCP, and all the associated reboots
##I thought it was silly that each saved change required a system reboot but the boot process is quick so it isn't really that much of an issue
##The interface is pretty intuitive
##I didn't look at the manual since I would have had to load the CD and open up the PDF file (doesn't come with a printed maual)
##The router shipped with the latest firmware so I haven't gone through the update process yet
##Once you have the router configured, your are able to save the settings to a file that can be used for future recovery
##My only regret with this purchase is that I waited so long to upgrade my old SMC router
##I'm not interested in the N functionality since I'm stuck with the Airport G card on my Powerbook
##This is more expensive than the G protocol routers but the improved signal strength is worth the cost
price[@]##The price is also more palatable considering the number of features that I haven't used yet (QoS, Port forwarding, etc
##) I'd recommend Xtreme N to anyone hoping to improve signal strength issues
##If you are serious about upgrading to the N protocol, you might want to wait a little longer to get a better read on when the standard will be established and to see if a firmware upgrade would bring the Xtreme N into compliance
[t] Unreliable in so many ways - but good when it works
##EDIT
[t] Worst. Router. Ever.
##This router throttles my 20 megabit per second (Mb/S) cable modem connection significantly, and it gets worse over time until it is unusable
speed[@]##Initially the speed drops from 20Mb/S down to about 16Mb/S
##As time goes on it gets slower and slower, eventually ratcheting down to dial-up speeds (~50Kb/S)
##Bypass the router completely (i
##e
##plug directly into the cable modem) and the 20Mb/S throughput is still there
##The problem is definitely the router
##A reboot of the router will get you back to reasonable performance for a while (although never what it should be)
##But it does not last for long
##Firmware updates haven't helped
##Avoid this router!
[t] Wired router OK, very disappointing wireless performance
##Gigabit wired performance - great, no problems
##Wireless performance - Poor
##I may hook up my old 11g WAP to improve performance
##My Netgear WGT624 lost several wired channels, so I upgraded to a D-Link DIR-655 to take advantage of 802
##11n, which I use at work successfully with the same laptop as I am using at home
##Wired Gigabit Ethernet in the house is an improvement
##OK there
##Bad News
[t] Good, but not quite ready for prime time.
##This router comes highly recommended, and out of the box in fact performed as advertised
##I purchased it for the Draft N speeds and the gigabit ability---both items I have on my computer systems at home
##However, I returned it for the following reasons
##Myself and many others out there were having problems that D-link or anyone else couldn't solve
##They were
[t] Great Router with a Couple Glaring Flaws
##First off, I should state that I am probably a 5% use case and that perhaps what I need is a small business-class router, but having tested this item at the limits of a home environment I can probably help some people out
##Ok, on to my network
[t] Disappointing
##I'm going to keep this relatively terse
port[@][u]##The USB  did not work with my Western Digital 1TB external hard drive, which was a primary reason I chose this router
port[@]##Connecting to a storage device plugged into the router's USB port requires the use of a D-Link application
##Only one client can ever be connected to the device at a time, which is pretty disappointing
##The client application did not ever work properly on Windows 7 64-bit
speed[@]##However, the worst thing about this router was the speed
##I fired up my bittorrent client to download a Linux ISO
##Over the course of about 30 minutes I was averaging around 150 kb/s
##I decided to unhook the D-Link router and plug back in my old Buffalo router (with Tomato firmware)
##I averaged 750 kb/s for the rest of the download
##My biggest regret is that I was out of town when the 30 day return period expired
[t] UPDATE - Do Not Buy This Version (Per D-Link tech support)
##*** UPDATE
[t] 2 years and still loving it.
##I've had this unit @ 2 years now and still loving it
##One note though is download the lastest drivers and install them instead of the outdated ones on the cd
##I am running a home network and am able to wirelessly stream hd video/audio from a newer build comp
##running vista 64 bit ultimate,amd quad core phenom 2, to my old gateway pc single core pentium 4 vista home premiun 32 bit
##A note
[t] Other than microwave interference, I am happy with it
##I have used it for a year
##It is reliable and the signal reaches the whole house when it is placed in the middle of the house from the ceiling
##The setup was straightforward
##I have a problem with interference from my microwave
##I have to connect directly to the router when it is running

[t] Used D-Link DIR-655 Wireless Router
##I was a little apprehensive about purchasing a used router on Amazon, but was pleasantly surprised
installation[@]##The router arrived earlier than stated, in the original box, complete with the installation disk and instructions
##I inserted the disk and followed the instructions and was soon on line with my wireless devices

[t] Unbelievable Performance
##I've had this router for over a year and a half and have had only great performance
##The D-Link DIR-655 supports all of my family's devices practically 24/7, providing excellent signal strength to the other end of our apartment (my iPhone typically connects from about two floors down)
##In terms of its dependability, I have never had a problem where the amount of connected devices was too high; they never put a dent in its capacity
##You will not regret your purchase
[t] Best home router I've had
##I've had 3 Netgear routers, 1 Linksys router, and 1 Dlink router, this one
##All the Netgear equipment failed not very long after the warranty period ran out
##The Linksys gigabit router WRVS4400N was marginal
##The OS inside the box would regularly "hang", so that no data would flow
##I had to power-cycle the router to get it going again
##My son-in-law has the same router, with the same problem
##Also, the Linksys would easily get overloaded, if two TV's tried to stream from Netflix at the same time
##The TV pictures would stutter, and the computer Internet feed would slow down greatly
##I had a fast 30 mbit/sec cable connection at the time
speed[@]##This Dlink gigabit router has been a big improvement in speed and reliability
##It never hangs, it never slows down
##It also has higher security, with WPA2-PAK
##In November, 2012, this router will be in use for 2 years in my home
##I've placed it in a second floor bedroom, so it covers the whole house, and the apartment (the home is a duplex)
##My tenant and I both use Netflix and Internet regularly, and we are both happy with the wireless service this router provides
[t] Works Great
##This is a great router easy to set up and super fast
port[@]##Has many great features too such as the wifi guest connection and the usb port
##Be sure to update the firmware before setting it up or you will have to set it up again
##Plug it in follow the on screen promts and your ready
[t] Beware of D-Link
##D-Link has the worst customer service and RMA practices in the business
##This is the second D-Link Router that has failed with in 6 months
##I would recommend you keep everything because when you have to RMA this router back to D-Link they want everything back
##Including the worthless outdated CD, which they think is worth $12
##00
##Plus you need to pay for the shipping of the defective product
##Then they have auduactiy to ship you back a USED router! The one i received was dusty, grimmy, and scratched
##So essentially I have paid 150
##00 for a USED router
[t] d-link hardware dies once the warranty is up
##router manufacturers design their hardware and manuals so at some point you will have to call and pay someone else to reset your router settings
##they know they could make these more fool-proof
##Check out all the confusion and difficulty people have by doing a search on "re-setting a d-link router"
[t] Couldn't be happier
##I'm a computer user - not a programmer or hardware guy
speed[@]##I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of setup, and with the network speed
##It's not the cheapest router you can buy, but not having to spend time figuring out how to get it to work was worth a little more
[t] Reliable Wireless N Router
##Linksys WRTGS was my previous router
##Although I am satisfied with its performance, its range didn't cover all area of my house
##So I decided to try one of wireless N router
##When I bought DIR-655 router a year ago, I was reluctant to do it since I hadn't had any luck with D-Link products, especially with its USB products
price[@][u]##But good reviews and  of the product made me try it out
##I am glad I did
##Installation was easy
internet[@]##You can connect it with cable modem and notebook via network cable, and set the router up with internet explorer (http
[t] Reliable full-featured and fast router
##I used to have a Linksys wireless G router that I thought was pretty good
##The thing had to be rebooted a few times a week whenever it'd get a web or VPN session "stuck" in it's memory-- I had been doing that routine so long, I just thought it was normal!Well, enter the DIR-655
port[@]##I was looking for a wireless N router with a USB port to use for network device sharing
price[@]##The DIR-655 fit the bill and price was nice too
##It was super simple to set up and had an attractive design as well
##I've now had this router nearly a year and it's NEVER needed a reboot! It's handled a mixed environment of N, G, and B devices, VPN sessions, and even an inbound Telnet session and has never flinched
##This little baby is ROCK SOLID and just does what it's supposed to do all the time every day
##Highly recommended!
[t] D-Link gets another chance
##I have owned a number of D-Link products
##I started buying them at the recommendation of a friend who, among other things, hated Linksys and Netgear
##I usually bought the bottom-of-the-line (entry level) products from places like Fry's for [
##] bucks
##Boy, what disappointments
##D-Link certainly drops the ball on ALL their entry-level routers
##Firmware quirks (oh, you wanted to be able to LOG INTO your router?), poor performance (Opps, the router has been on for more than a week striaght, time to crash), and yucky aesthetics plagued me for years
##Finally, I broke down and started looking for a router with Dynamic DNS capabilities
##A number of routers popped up as candidates
##Many offered custom firmware (tomato, openwrt, etc
##) but I couldn't find any that were Draft-N compliant (with my desktop and laptop)
##Finally, I came across the DIR-655 and I am glad I did
##The user interface is intuitive, if not a bit daunting, with the many, many features available for use
##This is definitely a device targeted for small businesses
##It has great features like a public wifi zone, so friends or neighbors can use your wireless without being networked to your systems
##You can set up dynamic dns with a service like freedns
##afraid
##org and have it point to your home network if you run an FTP or web server
##It is REALLY stable, too
##So, despite the fact that you CANT flash it to custom firmware, it still gets a resounding 5/5
##Some complain that the lights are too bright, but I haven't really been bothered by it
##Its right next to my TV and DVR and doesn't stick out too much
##I would have liked an all black version more, but this is fine
##If you have the cash to drop on a nice router, don't hesitate to put DIR-655 in the running!
[t] Switched from Linksys to D-Link
##After deciding it was time to upgrade to an Draft N router, primarily to get the additional range & speed, I immediately began looking at Linksys branded routers
##Upon reading polarized reviews with as much negative as positive feedback and remembering my mediocre experience with Linksys customer service over the years with the half a dozen or so Linksys devices I've owned, I began to look at alternative brands
##D-Link's reviews strongly tipped to the positive across a variety of sites including Amazon
##I purchased the router, went through the normal set up which I found to be straight forward and was up and running almost immediately
##What I really liked was the setup software's ability to find your current network and settings and ask if you if you are simply upgrading or if you want to create a new network
##My only reservations, preventing a 5 star rating, is I'm a bit disappointed in the range
##I needed 2 range extenders with my old G Linksys to cover my ranch style house and the D-Link N works without that need but just barely covers the advertised 300 foot range
speed[@]##I also find the speed to be less noticeable than I expected
speed[@]##I am happy with this product and the decision to move to D-Link, I just was hoping for a bit more magic in the speed and range than I've received
speed[@]##The net is that I feel like I have replaced my G speed & range with an N router that just simply doesn't need the range extenders
[t] Best Wireless Router out there
##I replaced my Linksys router with this d link and there is no comparison
##There are absolutely no hang ups or seconds of not performing and the coverage is excellent
##I have solid concrete walls and still get maximum signal all through a 3,000 sq ft house
##You just can't beat this one
[t] Reliable, Range, No Resets##Replaced a Belkin N1 Vision, which started out nice, but eventually needed constant restarts
##The Belkin had replaced a fried Netgear Gigabit Mimo (which fried in about 9 months, apparently a common problem with that router)
##Now I am back to DLink
##First DLink I had was great but replaced because it became outdated
##This one works well with more than one wireless computer on at a time
##So far, no resets required
##Good range, always connects, no drops
internet[@]##Installed quickly on Motorola SB modem on Comcast internet
##Update
[t] Perfect Match for Vista 64-bit
##The D-Link DIR-655 router solved all my wireless problems with Windows Vista 64-bit
internet[@]##I get high internet speeds (throughput) and reliability is awesome
##I paired up this router with the D-Link DWA-556 adapter card
##The initial router setup was not ideal (the setup CD is pretty worthless)
##But I called D-Link Tech Support and was up and running in minutes
##I love this router for Vista 64-bit
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##Great value for money
##Does everything a regular household needs out of a wireless router
port[@]##I couldn't get the USB port to share the printer which was annoying
##Any setup instructions online just didn't answer the question
##I didn't have time to call tech support so I am not sure how they would have handled that
##Good product, good price, can't go wrong for what it is worth!
[t] Happy with this product, in the beginning.....
##This is the first wireless router I have purchased and Im pretty content on how fast it is, I get the same speeds(when Im close the the router of course) as if I had the cable connected
##Also subpar speeds when in farther away in other rooms
##At the start it stopped giving off a signal on its own, don't know what the cause of it was but it seems to be working fine now
##*****01/08/2011 Update****Well I dropped the stars down to 2, it works well for a few hours then seems to drop connection which I have to hard reset the modem in order for it to get the connection again
##I've read a few forums and it seems people with this product has the same problem with no solution
##I really wish D-Link would address this problem
[t] great buy
##I'm fairly wi-fi illiterate, but needed it
##Bought this based on reviews
##Great product, great price, great range, fairly easy to set up, awesome tech support
##Buy it!
[t] Buy This One
##I have owned this router for 12-18 months to replace a D-Link router that died after several reliable years
##Easy set-up
##Just looked - the connection has been up for 150 days
##I think we went on vacation and powered everything down
##Incredibly reliable - better than my initial D-Link, which is saying something
[t] Great router
##The router works fine
speed[@]##No downtime so far and good speed
##The web menu is confusing and not well organized
##And two computers cannot use the hard drive or printer connected to router's USB atthe same time
##Only one computer has a lock to it and for second to use it first has to release the lock
[t] Awesome Router!
##I have owned many many routers, and this one has had ZERO issues
##It is lightning fast both through Wired or Wireless
##I have owned it for about a year, and has been rock solid since I first plugged it in
##I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a reliable router
##I had always had a 100% Linksys home network, until I purchased an N Router from Linksys that apparently TONS of people had issues with (as well as me), so I went looking for another product with great reviews, and came across this very model
##You will not regret it
##Seriously, buy this router
[t] The best so far...
##I have tried other wireless routers before and this is the best so far that I have!The other reviews that were positively written for this product was my guide in decidingto purchase this router
[t] DIR-655
##it seems to be working OK so far
##Although I expected a stronger signal but is still decent
##set up was rather difficult and with some problems (I had to call in technical support) but finally was done
[t] D Link Extreme N Router
##Nice product, sleek, easy to set up
##Had no conflicts or problems to fix when installing this and have had no problems since
[t] Fast, Reliable, Secure and easy to install!!!
##This wireless router is really Fast! reliable, secure and really to install
##Is the best wireless router for the price, and I couldn't find it on any store (Best Buy, Target, Wallmart)
##I have it install in a 3 bedroom apartment aprox 1200 sqf and the signal never drops
##I'm really enjoying it!
[t] Day 3 And Happy
##My reliable workhorse Belkin wireless-G of four years was starting to drop connection and required frequent reboots
##This frustrated the wife and so I went on the hunt for a new wireless-N Gigabit router
##Spent a solid 2 hours of research and settled on the D-Link for consistently good ratings and solid ranking [
##]
##Upon receipt and installation, I've been quite pleased
##I'm an intermediate-advanced user and this went smoothly
##Was up and running in short order
##The one issue I've run into is my wife's MacBook dropping the connection after sleep/wake up
##Believe this is on the Mac side
##I don't believe anything deserves anything deserves 5-Stars unless it's perfect, and while this is solid as a rock (thus far), it lacks a modern design and completely idiot proof wizard
##***10/31/2009 UpdateUnit still continues to run smoothly
##Issue with MacBook dropping connection cleared up within first week or two and has been solid ever since
##Highly recommend
[t] D-Link product Technical Support Team------ worst experience.
##Hi,I just bought it 15 days back
installation[@]##I tried to install it as described in the installation guide
##But it did not work for the first time
##So I called the D-link technical support team for help
##The call went to some other country and it was horrible to communicate with the support personal
##I had to explain the problem over and over again
##When the support guy was talking over the phone he was breathing and sound over the phone was irritating
##After he tried few times, he said "I can not help you
##Please call the D-link support number again" and gave me a case number
##I said why don't you connect me to the next level of support team
##He said "You have to call again, thank you" and hang up
##That guy wasted my time and could not fix anything
##Then I tried myself with my little networking knowledge and it's finally working
installation[@]##Please beware D-link has only 2-3 months free basic installation technical support
##After that you have to pay for the premium service
##I believe for Lynksys the support was free
##All the best!
[t] Good Product
##Installed this device about a week ago and had it up and running in about 20 minutes
##Easy to configure and has a large number of features
##I especially like that you can configure a wireless Guest Zone for some of the very old devices I have around the house
##The one downside, and its minor, is that there is no client tool to allow you to easily map the network
##Linksys has a very nice support tool that comes free
[t] Great Router
##I bought this router to replace an older Netgear wireless router that started having issues with the wireless portion
##Since installing the DIR-655, our wireless in the house has been much more solid
##The interface has been easy to use and I have recommended this product to friends and family alike
##The only thing I miss from my Netgear router is that it had keyword filtering which helped with providing filtering for all computers in my home
##I know this is not the best way to filter web content but it was fairly effective and did help
##The DIR-655 does have filtering but you have to block each site (domain) individually which is kind of a bummer
##Overall, am still happy with my purchase
[t] Works Great, easy to set up!!!!!!!
##I have been on the computer for a long, long time
##But, I am no expert, in ways I consider myself a computer moron, especially when it comes to things like setting on a network etc
##, well, this turned out to be super easy, after one setback
##when I attempted to set up the router the first time It would not work, But I thought that might happen, we had had a close lighting strike and my modem was never quite the same, so I called up AT&T; and they confirmed that the modem was defective ad overnight-ed me another modem
software[@]##It took an hour to set up the Modem, mostly running the software
##Now having done that the D Link Router was easy
software[@]##You just put the software in and follow the directions and bam, I think it took 10 minutes total, and another 10 to set on the receiving connector Card for my lap top Xtreme N Wireless Cardbus,adapter, Draft 802
##11N
##and this D link 130 wireless USB adapter for a second desktop computer D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapter
##I am on the lap top now and everything works great
##Update 10-28-11 Still working perfectly
[t] Good solid router
##I had my 655 up and running using WPA/PSK AES in less than 10 minutes
##Performance is pretty decent but the reason why I can't give it the 5th star is because after a firmware upgrade to version 1
##2
##1 the performace was cut by half
##Returned to version 1
##1
##1 and everything normal again
##I found more people who experiencied the same problem
##All the settings were backed up and restored after the upgrade
[t] Feature set is great... Too bad the wireless network will not stay up
##I bought this router today based on opinions I read here on Amazon
##Initially, a very easy setup
##That is, until I tried to configure the wireless network for it
##I'm not a newbie to wireless networking or networking in general (in fact, I managed a large CISCO-based WAN/LAN for 6 years)
##No matter how I configured this router, I could not get the wireless network to stay up for more that a couple minutes at a time
##And that was when I actually was able to connect
##I tried connecting with three different machines (each with a different wireless-g adapter) that worked fine on my old wireless router
security[@]##I thought that maybe it was a security configuration issue
##disabled all encryption, same thing
##Disabled all firewall settings, same thing
##D-link's knowledgebase on this product is very poor as well
##In addition to the wireless problems, the router would also drop my wired connections every so often just for the heck of it
##End result, this router goes back to Best Buy in the morning for something from a different vendor
[t] Great wireless router
##My previous router was a linkys router which would incessantly crash
internet[@]##I would spend more time resetting the router than actually using the internet
##I bought this router and was surprised at the difference that it made
##First of all, it was extremely easy to set up
##It doesn't require a degree in rocket science to operate
##The router comes with multiple directions and a CD that sets up the router
internet[@][u]##It took about 5 minutes to get the  running
internet[@]##Its been quite a while since the router was connected to the internet and I still have not encountered any problems
##Pros
[t] The Linksys Killer
##A few months ago when I decided to go wireless I went thru various Linksys wireless routers with so much frustration
##The signal was not strong enough and it would not be consistent, it would go in and out
##I went for Linksys because I worked on the Cisco HPR account and just wanted to support a client by being a client but I even bought the fancy Ferrari looking ones, the most expensive one, then the cheaper one, and even the older blue box looking one
##The guy at J&R suggested D-Link
##I was like what? I never heard of that
software[@][u]##I took it home and it was so easy to setup thanks to the included  called Pure Networks Network Magic
##It worked so good, strong signal that reached much farther away than any Linksys consumer router
##I was now able to use it across the street in the park
##I also purchased the D-Link DWA-140 RangeBooster Draft 802
##11n N Wireless USB Adapter to attach my neighbors computer to my network and it works flawlessly
##I highy recommend going with this setup instead of Linksys
[t] Conflicts with 2.4GHz Wireless Phones
##Total misery at first until I finally figured out my Uniden 2
##4GHz phones were conflicting with this router and my wireless adapters (on two computers)
##No problem with old Netgear router with the Uniden phones, so it took me a bit to figure out why the new router worked SLOWER than my old Netgear
##Easy fix--bought new 1
##9GHz DEC phones and now everything works GREAT
##Speed is so fast it's like I'm hard wired to my router
##Great price, good web interface--well worth the money (and time to figure out everything) spent
[t] Works for me
##I have a Macbook, 2 PC's and an Ipod touch, all running wirelessly
##However, there were some dead spots in my house and I wanted something that had a little more range than my previous router, an older Dlink
##We're also using some demanding video applications, and I hoped that a newer router would lead to smoother viewing
##I noticed people reviewing this router complained about 2 things
[t] Excellent home router
##We needed a new wireless router as our old one was just not capable of handling all the wireless computers we had attached to it
##I did some online research and this looked like a good one
##My wife does all the setting up for our computers
##She had a fit with the last one and she raved about the ease of this one
##All our computers logged on quickly and we were up and running
##I would say this router is perfect for a large house with multiple computers
##We have about 7 connections and we aren't dropped like we were with the old router
[t] Perfect
price[@]##Excellent price and performance combination
##I had an old Netgear router that was dropping pages and connections all the time, and after analyzing all routers on the market for home needs I found this one and went with it
##As far as setup goes, I am the kind of person that always screws something up and has it take much longer than I expect to install things
##Although once again I managed to screw it up, it still only took 20 minutes to get this installed
##It has been a joy---reliable, fast, and efficient thus far
##I highly recommend this router
[t] Buy this now!
##I have been looking to upgrade my 8 year old 2wire modem/router for a few months
##I researched numerous models and brands and this one seemed to be the best for me
##Price was good and I received my order in less than two days using the $3
##98 Prime shipping option
##Pros - Fast connection and super transfer speeds
##Easy to set-upGreat rangeCons - The only thing I had a problem with was pairing this with my old modem/router
##I wanted to use my old router just as a modem and the new one for everything else
##It may just have been me, but it did take some time
software[@][u]##If you don't have to worry about pairing this with an old modem then set up is a breeze with the included 
##This is by far much faster and has a larger range than my old one
security[@]##Then again I did upgrade from a 801b to 801n protocol so that could be why!All in all this is a great router that can stream almost any file and have a great set of security features to keep the neighbors and others out of your network
[t] very good range!
##I bought this router mainly because of its extended signal range feature
##I have a 1850sf single story house plus a seperated 250 sf entertainment room 5 feet away from the house
##The signal strength is excellent in every corner of the house and in the outside entertainment room as well
internet[@]##We also have a mobile home as a guest house 100 feet away from the main house and I was wishing the signal strong enough to reach the mobile home so the internet can be avaiable to our guest
internet[@]##Guess what? After the setup, I went over one of the room in the mobile home and my laptop can detect the signal! It is not strong but at least there is no problem to go on the internet
##I am very happy with this router
[t] Great router
##This is a great product
##I've had mine for a couple of years or more, and it has performed well from the start
port[@][u]##I wish the USB  worked as a print server instead of the patchwork printer sharing setup, but it's a router after all, not a print server
[t] Greaattt
##Great wireless router thats wireless N and G
speed[@]##Great speed but i dont see a difference in the range, but that might be because of my router location
[t] Installation Was Soooo Easy
##I had the prior version of this router for 2 years
##I started having connection issues and based upon process of elimination it appeared to be the router
##I decided to buy a new one rather than spending hours trying to confirm the router was dying
##Installation of my old router had been difficult but since it always worked well until it apparently died I went for it
##In less than 30 minutes the new router was installed and all computers and printer tied into the network - working perfectly
installation[@][u]##It was a cinch - loved the CD which made  a breeze
##Connectivity is great
##Reception is very good
##Got a new mini computer this weekend and it found the network easily
##I am happy
[t] Took less than 30 minutes to get our network up
##Very simple instructions got our wireless network up and running in less than 30 minutes
##Included is the best user manual I've ever seen for home computer equipment
##You can use it for quick reference or deep study of how to configure a cafe wireless network with many, many options
##Various problems that people give this modem one star for, like WPA compatability with older hardware, or timing out after a week, are easily solved by a little patience and a search or two through the manual
##Mine runs 24 hours a day and stays at room temperature
security[@]##It has lots of options, so we had to change a few to balance enhanced security with performance
##But the manual is fantastic
##Only pet peeve is that the jacks and the antennae are kind of jumbled together, meaning if you want to wall mount this, things get a little messy--especially if you have more than a single ethernet connection
##(There really is no way to wall mount it and point the antennae up, but I doubt that is any kind of an issue
##More an aesthetics thing
##)Otherwise, this is a fast, easy to use router that has max signal strenght throughout our 2000 sq ft place
##Plus, it has many features you might "grow into" someday
[t] DIR-655 works well.
##Make
[t] Router is garbage after 6 months
##Router worked adequately during the first 5 months - I was disappointed that the wireless signal was no better than an old Belkin G router - that was the primary reason for my upgrade
##After 5 months (too late to return to Amazon), the problems began
##The router started to lock up every 2 weeks
##Customer service is/was terrible and their resolution to the router consistently locking up is to reset it
##If you are like me and have your phone connected thru VoIP, this is not an appealing option as you miss calls and have the hassle of resetting it over and over
##When the emails to customer service escalated to being able to call a real person, I was on hold for 30+ minutes twice and they wanted to spend a significant amount of time diagnosing the router - about half way thru I realized that even if they sent me a new one of these, I would never use it again so I hung up
##Please save yourself the headache and hassle and buy a different brand - from all the information I read, they all have some troubles so one with good service and warranty will be on my list
[t] Great for the wireless family!
##I have a very demanding wireless family, with the 5 of us sometimes running up to a dozen or more devices at once, including 4-5 laptops, 4-5 iPads/iPods, 2 kindles, and a Roku Netflix receiver, etc
##and nothing off a shelf in any area store could handle that demand plus a pair of wired desktop systems
##So I invested in this baby about 2 years ago when it was around $200 and it has worked FLAWLESSLY ever since! It is up on a wall in a central room in the house and everyone can run whatever they want, however demanding they want, simultaneously, with no loss or lag
##This and my 30meg service has done the job completely for several years now
##It has a few cool features that I never even got around to setting up, like the USB printer port, but it doesn't matter
##I wanted a router that would handle everything my family needed, and it has
##If you are hitting that point in your house where you have the bandwidth from your ISP but too high of a demand in your household to keep everyone happy at the same time, then this baby is for you, the DIR-655
[t] What Route would you take
##The D - Link router work's as described and have had no issues
##It was packed and shipped in a very timely manner and received without issue
##It was easy to set up (took just a couple of minutes)
##I had more issues and time in mounting where I wanted it in my distribution center
[t] Easy to configure and powerful connection!
##Excellent product! From setup to operation is very easy for a person new in all this network
##It has an excellent range that does not decrease the bandwidth of the connection!
[t] Lots of features, too bad its not very good hardware
##My DIR-655 finally died and I have to say I'm glad it did
##I was initially attracted to this router based on features and earlier favorable reviews
##I even recommended it to friends and some bought it as well
##Of the few friends who bought it, they ended up with the Rev B hardware and had issues right out of the box and returned it
##My DIR-655 ran great for about a year, then I'd have to unplug it often to get it to reset
##My internal wired connections dropped while the wireless was still working so I know it wasn't my cable mode
##It got to the point where I was constantly tweaking settings to get a more constant connection
##Yesterday while unplugging it to reset the connections I noticed when I plugged it back in that I wasn't getting all the lights coming on
##I jiggled the connection a bit and noticed them flicker off and on
##It wasn't the adapter, but an internal connection
##At this point I had it
##I don't want to fight a piece of hardware constantly
##I ran out and got a Netgear Wireless N router
##I've only had it going for a day but I'll wait a month to review it
##Yeah, its got less features but if it's more stable I'm FINE with it
##Stay away from the DIR-655, honestly from my personal experience, that of my friends and the significant number of bad reviews for this product I can't recommend this router
[t] Hot item...but not all that hot!
##As a previous reviewer pointed out, this thing gets way too hot
##How can anything be dependable over the long haul when it gets hot and stays hot? Then the other day, when the signal began dropping several times a day, out of the blue I'd had enough
##Speed was nothing to write home about either
##If you are unhappy with your purchase be sure to send it back before the window of time expires to return it
[t] Powerful - lightening fast WiFi with NO dead corner ...
##This 802
##11N WiFi router is so powerful that I could use my iPad 1000 feet away, and it still has 10Mbps of connection, awesome! Note
[t] Very good product
##Muy buen router, excelente en velocidad de se&ntilde;al wifi, lo unico que sus luces azules son muy fuertes, pero de resto el router esta bienVery good router, excellent wifi signal speed, the only thing his blue lights are very strong, but the rest of the router is OK
[t] Great Router for me
##I needed a new router for my place in Maine, and I have had previous good luck with DLink products, so I purchased this in August of last year
##I am extremely pleased as this thing works like a champ on steroids
##I have never experienced any router that delivered as fast of connection through wired and wireless devices or had the range that this thing does
##None of the previoius routers were able to penetrate through the solid insulation and drywall to my upstairs bedroom which btw shows an excelent signal using this product
##I have also streamed three movies at once with not even a hickup on any of the TV screens
speed[@]##My service provider is TWC and the speed delievered is 15 MBPS download with 5 MBPS upload
##I am very happy with my purchase and recomend this product
##I hope that this can perform as well for anyone that purchases it
##While this router will not solve slower DSL problems, metal objects placed near the router that surpresses the WiFi signal, or user error, this thing has worked flawlessly for me
##I have mine on top of a bookcase in the living room and it supports 2 wired devices, one wired printer, 7 wireless laptops, one game console, one BB smart thing, and a couple of I-things with ease
##WOW!PS, I do agree, the blue lights are pretty but very bright at night so I no longer need a night light in the living room as a result
[t] Doesn't meet it's Marketing/Firmware issue never ever fixed
speed[@],port[@]##This Dink Link product was marketed as a high speed router that could do it all including use a USB port to network a Printer and hardware devices such as external hard drives
antennas[@][u]##The positives I have is the unit is solid and not made of the cheap plastic, has three 
port[@]##For me because I paid for the USB port to work and it never did, I give a huge 30% downgrade
##There have also been huge problems with Sharepoint and their third party and 3rd world customer service
##Expect to wait for hours
##Then get no help
##There was no customer support for Macs
##Although I did get that from another place
##From strictly getting a wireless signal from my router throughout my house, it did fine
##But this router was suppose to do more than that
##It had trouble with VOIP
price[@]##For the price I paid, I would estimate vs, the hardware/service and lack of functionality I was promised, but never received, I would give this router a 6
##5 out of 10
##I now mainly use it with a hard wire
security[@]##Many computer I hook up with it significantly slow down when I add the basic security feature
##I don't think DLink has ever tried solving that problem
[t] Great Product
##Great product, works perfectly and i received it on time with no problems what so ever
[t] Seems OK
##I've only had it for a short time, but it seems to be working OK
##Has an instlal wizard to get you going, but if you want to really get into it to set up your configurations, you need to know what you are doing with routers
[t] Very good but has some problems
##It's very easy to setup, nice web interface
##Allows you to connect a USB printer and share it
##Signal strength is pretty good throughout my house (> 3000 sq ft) but doesn't penetrate the brick walls to get outside
##However, USB Printer sharing is flaky, at best
##Generally I have to reboot the router to get the printer to work
##From what I have read on forums, this is a common issue
[t] Would not connect to the Internet (DHCP)
##After many days of trying, I sent it back
##Even their technical suppport couldn't correct it
##My old router was able to connect without any fuss
##However, the return to Amazon was easy
[t] Enjoyed Wireless!! for 2days##I bought this product
##For numerous reasons
##The reviews I read about it, and the great deal on here
##It was such an easy setup
##Doesn't take much
##My wireless was working perfectly for my Xbox
##Then 2 days later
##Know one could play any games on Xbox live why? Because no connection found
##I tried plenty things to fix it
##Such as reconnecting and connecting, that didn't work
##I tried pulling out the power source and connecting it back and that didn't work
##I only got Ethernet from this router and since it didn't give me the wireless it promised
##I returned it
[t] Awesome features, flaky product/firmware
##I have to admit that I almost always read product reviews and don't write any
##For this product I couldn't help but to add my experience
software[@]##I'm a software developer with plenty of experience setting up networks
##I was very happy with the features available in this product, but some of the comments worried me
##I took the plunge anyway, mostly because I was glad to see DLink offers open forums to the public for their products
##Setup was fast and easy and all devices were connected quickly
##I usually make a point to upgrade firmware right after buying something like this, but for some reason I waited a couple of months
##The router didn't work too badly during this time with a few disconnects and necessary reboots
##When I upgraded the firmware to the latest version, the router started dropping wireless connections, rebooting randomly, etc
##DLink doesn't allow you to go back to the previous firmware version either
##This initially didn't scare me too much because I figured with my knowledge I could play with the settings and figure it out, or rely on the forums at DLink to get answers
##Well, after a few more months of fighting with this thing, no luck
##It has become unusable
##Maybe, given enough time, they will come out with a firmware that makes this thing work, but I got tired of waiting
##I have since went back to the same brand I've always purchased over the years - Linksys
##There are plenty of people who don't like Linksys either, but I haven't had one bad experience in the many products I've purchased
##The replacement router is the Linksys WRT160Nv3
##It has been rock solid from day one
[t] D-LINKS DIR-655 EXTREME N WIRELESS ROUTER
##IT IS JUST PERFECT
##EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE IS HAPPY NOW
##WE ALL HAVE INTERNET AT THE SAME TIME
[t] Extreme may be a little grandiose . . .
internet[@]##My chief concern for adding the wireless connection was to be able to use my laptop in my home with the confidence of a secure hardware router firewall, having recently lost the battle with some very difficult malware acquired through a flimsier Sprint USB internet connection
speed[@]##The D-Link works well and speed is quite good on my Lenovo X200 laptop, but, even though I use it just down the hall from the room the router now resides in, I still get some dropout
##Thus, it would seem that some of the hype concerning better coverage and greater distance will still take a back seat to the simple physics of bouncing off walls and through doorways
##Downstairs I get virtually nothing, but, since I never need the laptop connection there, I don't really care
##I can add another router as a repeater--either hardwired (best) or wireless (easier bu slower), but the cost for these is about another $100 or so
##Another issue was connectivity
##With Spyware Doctor, Ad Aware Pro, and McAfee antivirus running, plus different versions of Windows (XP Pro to Windows 7) on the network, I found it challenging to get the network set up, and finally purchased Network Magic from Cisco
##That solved most of the problems
##The one remaining problem was McAfee itself
##Running a now outmoded network program, it was surreptitiously blocking my laptop connection so that I could not use the network computer's printer
##It took a 2-hour trouble call with a McAfee guy in Bombay, India to finally figure this out and correct it
##Oi
##But now the system is humming (except for the dropouts, that is)
[t] Dlink excellent wireless router
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless RouterIt is just excellent and unexpensive router for a home network
[t] Router not stable, unrealistic RMA requirement.
##Let me first say the router is not stable in keeping the wireless connection
##After upgrading to 1
##32NA, things get worse
##Router would hang up on wireless every one or two days
##When it dies, I can't even login into the router
##The only way is to replug the power
##I called the tech support in india and after several days back and forth they finally agreed to issue an RMA
##Now the kick part, you have to return EVERYTHING from the original package to qualify the return, including
[t] Best Router i use
##Very happy with this unit
##Long Range, setup took me 5min tops
##Its been use in a house with 4 rooms and 2 levels
##Every corner of the house has coverage
internet[@]##Took iPod outside the yard and i still got internet
[t] It just works
##Here's my home network
[t] Best of the best
##It was very easy to setup the router
##The one that I previously bought was of Netgear it was very hard to setup
##Also the range of the router is very good
##It is fast and it does not loose the signal as my Netgear was doing
##We always play games in network
##This is awesome router that anyone can buy within good range
[t] Extremely Easy to Setup, Great Range
##I was hesitant to buy the router as there were a lot of reviews on Amazon that mentioned that the unit was hard to setup or that a lot of contact with customer support was necessary
##I found none of those statements to be true
##From the time I opened the box to the time the router was up and running was less than 10 minutes
software[@]##The software that comes with the router was extremely easy to use and my laptop and Kindle had no issues finding the new wireless connection and logging right on
##I'm receiving an excellent signal from anywhere in the house and the amount of walls or floors that the signal travels through does not degrade its strength at all
installation[@]##I would to recommend this router to anyone looking for ease of installation and a reliable connection
[t] What's Wrong With This Thing?
##First off, I'm only using the product as a switch and wireless access point
##The configuration interface is nice and quick and it connects to all my various wifi devices (game consoles, laptops, PCs, etc) without a problem - which is exactly the reason why I got the dir-655 to replace my aging Linksys AP
##And contrary to some of the other reviews, this device never got very hot - just a bit lukewarm (though it was stood up vertically, perhaps that helps?)
##The problem is that using the radio in N-mode or mixed N-mode causes the radio to shut itself down around 24-48 hours
##The switch still works and I can still ping the internal address
##Just the wifi stops
##I tried firmware up and down
##Factory resets
##Having the radio on with no clients associated with it
##It STILL shuts down after a day or so
##A power-cycle to the device restores the radio
##but why is this happening?The D-Link tech support and forums don't provide much help aside from running it in G-mode or mixed G-mode
##I also found that this my problem with the radio shutting down was not uncommon
##I do admit, that without enabling wifi-N, the device is solid and reliable
##It still connects to all my devices and the range is pretty good for wireless-G
streaming[@]##My local LAN just can't enjoy the benefits of the wifi-N speeds and it does get noticeable when you're locally streaming multimedia
##Oh well
##probably replace it with a different device
##It'll be relegated to a backup wired router or switch
##Too bad
[t] Old and Faithful
##Well I've had this router since 2007 and it's still going strong
internet[@]##The only time I've had to reset is when I've moved or the modem (or isp) has to reset and trouble shoot internet connection, all times it was never the router always the provider
##I run 2 Android Evos, HP Wireless Printer, Xbox with Netflix and FB streaming, Netbook, Toshiba laptop, HP Touchsmart Desktop, and a DLink Wireless Security Cam 930-L
internet[@]##Sometimes all at the same time, and my connection and network sharing of files and internet is lightening fast! First router was a Linxsys and recently tried Netgear offsite from home and both do not compare to DLink
##I was an Exec
##Asst for the IT exec and learned a lot about networking and computers from him, mangers, and consultants
##I love this router still, very good quality, well manufactured and put together and solid product from hardware to firmware
##I bought mine at Sam's club when it first came out (160s range) but I see it's still going strong
##I try to buy all things DLink first
##The DLink Security Camera 930-L is awesome and syncs well with the router
##LOVE IT!
[t] Great router
##I love this router
##I shopped around for a while before deciding to buy this one
##The set up was easy, and both of our laptops were able to connect within just a few minutes of taking the router out of the box
port[@]##The usb port is fantastic! I have an older usb printer that I've had to share between 2 computers
##In the past I've had to unplug the usb cable from one machine to connect it to the other
##Now I have the printer connected to the router and I can connect to it from anywhere in the house
[t] Stops broadcasting several times a day
##Received from Amazon on 2/19/11 and installed same day
##No problems
##Worked great
##Connected 5 computers, TiVo, Samsung HDTV, and Panasonic BluRay all in less than an hour
##Fast, strong signal throughout house, on both floors
##Then after about 6 hours is just stopped broadcasting
##LAN still worked, but wireless just stopped on all 4 computers connected by wireless
##Cycled power and all of them came back
##Then after 6 or 7 hours, just stopped again
##Got on D-LINK support, and was told to reposition away from other electronics
##Did that
##Moved router and modem to another room
##Worked great for about 6 hours then just stopped broadcasting, again
##After perusing D-LINK forums, it's seems this is a common problem for which there is no fix
##Forum members hoping for firmware update
##I'm going to do a firmware upgrade
##If that doesn't work I'm sending it back
[t] I bought a second one...
##It worked so well and was so easy to configure, over a period of more than 6 months of use I bought a second one to create another network at another location
##First, it's very well rated by commercial sites and those who know a great deal concerning such things
##Just do a search for wireless router reviews
##The ratings are uniformly good
##It's also quite well rated by average users
##This is what began my interest in the product
##Second, it's very compact, about 3/4 the size of my cable modem
##It has a small footprint on my desktop
##Neither of my two units run hot
##I have each of them stacked on top of their corresponding modems with no heat buildup problems
##Third, the range is quite good
##Each is installed on the bottom floor of a two story house
##One is actually in an outside corner
##It feeds three laptops at once, when they are located in any part of the building
##The bandwidth and throughput certainly seem adequate to serve each of the two grandkids on Youtube while their mother does email on the third laptop
##Last and most important, it's very easy to setup and configure
##The cables are long
##The instructions on the DVD are clear and easy to follow
##If you have no need for a custom install, there is even a little program on the DVD to walk you through the entire setup
installation[@]##Due to moving and changing some hardware, I've had to reconfigure and customize one installation
##Even customizing the settings for the router was easy
software[@]##Don't forget to download the most current software version when you install
##The manufacturers web page is very clear
security[@][u],installation[@]##Also please don't forget to add the  settings for your installation
##It's very easy to so with the included tutorial
[t] The Best Home Office Router
##This is one of the most successful models
##Once DLink updated their firmware about a year ago, I've never had any problems since
##I haven't switched it off for almost a year
##It keeps going no problem
##I'm heavy user, have a couple web servers, sling box, 2 VOIP phone lines(wired), 3 laptops(WiFi), 1 desktop, 2 iphones (WiFi) using this router
##It was easy to setup, security, firewall rules, ip forwarding - piece of cake
##I had 2 Linksys before
##I cannot even compare
##With Linksys , I had to keep power-cycling it at least once a month when performance was degrading
##I had to replace two routers before I got to this one
##I've never had to look back since
##The coverage area is very good
##I can access it from basement, without significant loss of signal (the unit is installed on the second floor)
##I can still access my WiFi from about 100 feet off my house
##I got full 300 MBps with the N-type
speed[@]##The worst speed within the house was about 150MBps
##Don't buy extended antenna, which D-Link tries to sell you, waste of money, the unit works perfectly without it
##Workhorse, look no further
[t] Does everything I want it too.
##This is the best router I have owned to date
price[@][u]##I am sure there are better on the market, but at this  range, this thing is the bee's knees
##I would recommend it to my friends
[t] Large home wifi coverage my eye!
##This router is advertised at the D-Link site to cover large homes, up to 10,000 square feet I think
##I have 2800 square feet and the coverage was lousy with a dsl modem connected to the 655
##I even tried replacing the antennae on the router with some high gain 9bi antennae, which improved the coverage only marginally
##The router was fairly easy to setup using the setup disc
##There is the possibility that the problem, however, was not with the router but with my dsl signal
##I finally gave up and ordered Roadrunner
internet[@]##With Time Warner's recent push on low introductory rates and the fact that I was paying over $35 for dsl, I switched to cable internet with a faster connection and a lower price--at least for the first year
[t] horrible disgusting
internet[@]##i bought this router about six months ago it worked perfectly fine untill one day it jammed mind you i have called dlink over ten times to solve other issues my laptop would connect but no internet and when i got internet just for a few moments only my desk top would connect wireless coz i had a d link usb adapter it was frustrating a waste of money
[t] Missing The ONE Feature I Really Needed
##This wireless router (if you are going to use it as your main wireless router) is great
##The signal is strong, and it isn't a huge chunk out of your wallet to buy
##But if you are looking for a device that is going to be able to bridge a connection and function as a wireless router you are looking in the wrong place
##I didn't find this out until after I purchased it
##So here I am to warn the rest of you
##BEWARE
##you can not use this router as a bridging device
##But if you are going to use it for a main wireless router you are fine
##But I give it two stars for not listing its inability to do so
##since the model DOWN from this one can
##and the model above this one can
##but oddly enough this specific model is unable to
##2 is what you get
##and be happy I'm not giving it a 1
[t] DO NOT BUY!
##I live with four other people and thought this would be a good router, I was wrong
##Constantly need to re-install and reset
##very frustrating!!
[t] Fast Router
##Arrived early
##It was easy to set up
##It detected the i-touch, wireless pc, laptop and gaming console
##No latency
[t] Replaced a Cisco
##I bought this product in order to replace a Cisco E3000
##The D-link (musch less expensive than the Cisco) has worked flawlessly
##I highly recommend the D-Link, and recommend anyone considering the Cisco look closer at D-Link
[t] Awful experience gaming with this router
##I had an awful experience with this router
##It set up quickly and easily enough, and worked ok at first
##The router was faster than my old b/g router
##However, within a few days the problems started
##I would wake up in the morning and the router had disappeared from my computer's network detection
##Horrible latency spikes would plague my online gaming experience
##Power cycling the cable modem and the router would fix these problems temporarily, but the reboots became more and more frequent
##When the network started dropping inexplicably and all of a sudden, I had had enough
##I'm returning this router, and never buying a D-Link ever again
##Maybe my problems were a fluke? Well, then this would be the only negative review D-Link gets
##Maybe I just didn't set the router up properly? Well, then maybe D-Link should have made it easier to set up
##Either way, if you don't want headaches from your wireless router, my recommendation is you buy from a different brand
[t] A bit overrated in my opinion
##Well, other than having to reset the broadcast signal once per week on average, it is a good router
##It had the features I was shopping for (wireless N, Gigabit capabilities), but failed to deliver on the reliability/stability of the wireless network
##If you have this in a cabinet or tucked away anywhere, look for another product
##Fortunately, I have this easily accessible to a power strip that I can just power-cycle on demand, along with the cable modem
##Ideally, wireless routers shouldn't be enclosed for best results anyway, and it seems D-link capitalized on that
##The features of the router itself are good (but relatively standard for a decent model), even though it is tricky to forward the respective ports for applications that require open ports
##(i
##e
##gaming, Remote Desktop/VNC clients)The reason my rating is no higher or lower is because it just balances out (breaks even) with the deficiency in the wireless signal
##6/5/2012 update
[t] A very good, fast router
internet[@]##If you find that you are having a problem with the D-Link DIR-655 router habitually dropping your internet connection, try this
[t] Great Router
##This router works great
##I Have had no more losses of signal or slow connections
##Wish it was a modem/router, though
##It was also very easy to set up
[t] Very happy
##Read the reviews and bought this thing
##My router was a little old and decided to upgrade from the Netgear
##Anyway
##just set it up and it could not have been easier
##Connection is crisp and connection to PS3 is 100% from 65% before
##so we're all happy
internet[@]##Internet on computer is so fast, I got to the end of the internet in no-time today!I highly recommend this wireless router
[t] D-Link DIR-655 met or surpassed all of my routing needs
##I needed a new router to replace my old linksys BEFSR81 (w/WAP54G for wireless)
##I had just upgraded my cable broadband service from 7mbps to 20mbps, but my old Linksys had a max WAN throughput of 10
##I did a lot of research and decided on D-link
##I have NO REGRETS
##None
##I give this gem 5 stars across the board
##It was very well packaged, extremely easy to setup (the setup wizard could NOT be any easier to understand), and performs flawlessly
##D-Link did a great job in the design and construction of this product
##I have 4 hardwired [cat-5 cable] PC desktop computers attached to the ethernet ports
##In addition, 1 desktop and 4 laptops using the wireless access
##Wireless reception is as good or better than the Linksys WAP54G
speed[@]##When I run the brighthouse speed test now, instead of maxing out in the upper 9mbps, I am consistently over 19mbps
##D-Link DIR-655 gave me exactly what I needed in a wireless router, replacing both of my old LinkSys products
##I highly recommend this product for home or small business networking needs
[t] DLink
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless RouterHad purchased this product before and have set them up in different locations
##Am very satisfied
[t] So far, GREAT!
##I don't know much about IT technology, so I needed something easy to install, no hassle performance
##I read reviews on it before buying it
internet[@]##I got it, a breeze to set up and so far has been working wonderfully!Due to work I am on the internet 24/7 and not one single time has this shown a weak signal
##I live in a condo, the signal shows full force no matter where in the condo I am
##Maybe I should take the laptop out to the garage and test it
##6 floors down
[t] Great router!
##Great performance
##I bought this because I could get only very poor reception in my basement with my Linksys WRT54G
##With this, however, I get four bars (full signal) everywhere except the farthest corner of the basement and my house is moderately large
internet[@],speed[@]##Here I still get three bars and decent internet speed
##Also, it was very easy to set up and install
##All you do is pop in the disc and follow the instructions, you don't have to worry about any complicated details for settings and security, etc
security[@][u]##Just make sure to remember your  code!
[t] Best router ever bought
##This is the best router i have ever bought
##Previously i had two linksys routers and every so often they will diconnect
internet[@]##I have had this Dlink router for 3 weeks now and i have had no drops in the internet connection
##The set up itself was trouble free and the signal strength is amazing
##I will recommend this to anyone looking to purchase
[t] It does what it's supposed to do.
##It's a wireless router and it works! I was concerned about the setup, but it turned out to be very easy
[t] Excellent and easy
##Very good coverage in other than ideal conditions
##Easiest setup I've run across
##Very clear interface
##No ambiguities
##I live in a house with 12 - 18 inch thick adobe walls covered in chicken wire to hold on the plaster in the original part of the house
##Even so, I get a (barely) usable signal in the frame addition
##Line of sight has the signal passing through 3 of the above mentioned adobe walls, and one steel door
##Couldn't believe it, but it works
##Unfortunately, it doesn't work quite well enough, so in the end, I installed a wireless access point hardwired (I had the foresight to wire the house with Cat5E when the addition was put in) to the router from the frame part of the house
##The 5 GHz signal from the access point has to pass through only one adobe wall (and nothing else) to get to the front (adobe section) of the house, but it's totally invisible
price[@]##This is really a very high quality router, and the price is excellent
##2
##4 GHz only which might be an issue in a crowded urban environment, but out in the boondocks where I am it's flawless
[t] Awesome router!
##Just awesome! Connection is stable and fast! So far I've never had an issue with it
##Works like a charm
##Highly recommended!
[t] goood router
##I took this router to india, working good
##Its fast and easy to hook up
##I would recommend buying this router for home use
[t] failed after less than 1 year
##This router failed after less than one year
speed[@]##It also did not live up to it's long range/high speed claims
[t] Good Router
##Upgraded from the Linksys Wireless G router
##Was attracted by the claim of 6x longer range as received a weak signal from far side of house with the Linksys
speed[@]##Fast and easy set-up but signal on far side is not any better; although the speed is faster
##In all fairness, due to configuration of the house, signal needs to pass through 2 exterior walls to get to far side location
[t] Wireless drops off daily
##I had no problems installing this replacement router
##However, after a few weeks, it started to drop the wireless signal
##We have to reboot the device nightly
##What really sucks, I just missed the return window with Amazon
[t] Robust and Effective Wireless Router!
##This thing works great! Have it mounted in our computer room in the lower level of our walkout ranch and it always works even when ALL DOORS are closed throughout the house
##We even take our laptop outside and down to our lake and it works perfectly even at that distance! Definately a robust and effective wireless router
##Buy one, you won't be disappointed!
[t] Have to reboot too often
##It's amazing that a lot of routers have equal amounts of great and bad reviews
##makes it hard to figure out which one is really good
##From my experience, this router has been a dud
##It needs to be rebooted frequently, and the signal gets weak only 40 feet away
##Also our xbox only gets a strong signal once in a while
##It has been incredibly frustrating, mostly the rebooting
##I am going to write off this investment and buy a netgear
[t] Radio Keeps Shutting Off
##I've had positive experiences with DLink and Amazon recommended items
##The DIR-655 has great reviews and a bucket load of features (including ones I'm never likely to leverage)
##The most important thing, however, would be for the product to work and work simply
##Periodically, the wireless radio will turn off
##This is guaranteed proximate to power down / up (e
##g
##vacations)
##But happens less frequently without obvious associated event
##Secure, yes
##Intended use case, no
##Unfortunately, there is no "turn radio on" toggle via the management interface
##So, I could follow DLink advice and re-accomplish the wireless setup wizard from a directly connected workstation
##Or, I could wait until the mood strikes, and the radio is restored
##In fairness, this creates about a 10-20% downtime scenario
##And, I'm sure my perception is inflated from reality
##So, I'd recommend that you pick a similarly rated, but alternate product
[t] Flawless Connectivity
##As an IT professional it's imperative that I'm able to establish and keep an active VPN connection for remote support and troubleshooting
##I have been incredibly impressed with how the D-Link DIR-655 has performed
internet[@],streaming[@]##In our household we are extremely heavy internet users and consistently transfer a couple hundred gigs worth of streaming content a month
##The DLink DIR-655 has performed this task flawlessly
##I can have 4 simultaneous Netflix streams and still maintain a rock solid VPN connection without the unit breaking a sweat
##If anyone is looking for a rock solid replacement for an aging Wireless G router you should definitely buy this wireless router
##I recommend it to all of the remote users that I support and once they deploy this product all of their connectivity issues disappear
##SincerelyAn Extremely Happy IT Engineer
[t] Great Router
##Very easy to setup
##Great signal throughtout the house
price[@]##Cannot beat the price
##I have worked with other wireless routers and this one is far superior
[t] Just Say No
internet[@]##I have set up multiple wireless routers before this one and cannot get this to connect to the internet
##Nothing I tried worked
##After multiple attempts and hours of frustration, I've put this item back in the box and will probably throw it away
##Don't waste your money
##Just say "NO" to all of the hype
##Stick with Linksys!!
[t] no problems on att u-verse
##my isp
[t] just what we needed
##Our Dsl company provided us with a modem that just didn't have the power needed to transmit to my laptop
##We bought this with hopes that my laptop could finally be free of a cord
##IT IS! We get great signal on the laptop anywhere in the house
##Our Wii gets great signal and we love being able to plug our printer into the usb and print from both computers
##We have it in the plastic holder that comes with and have not had any problems with overheating or bright lights like some reviews stated
##While in the holder the lights actually face down so are barely visible
##Overall love it!
[t] Great Speed
##I use as a wired router
##Speed was very fast for downloads
streaming[@][u]##No more problems with  Netflix videos
##Did not test wireless
##Set up did not work from CD but help desk was very good
[t] unreliable
##Range is decent and it seems to handle multiple computers fine, but stops broadcasting after two days
internet[@]##Still has internet when attached via wire but the wireless cannot even be seen
##Have to disable and enable the wireless then it is good for two days again
##This is a common problem, see the dlink forums
##[
##]
[t] Line of sight reception only
##I don't know how far the wireless routers are supposed to work, but this one only works a few feet
##Certainly not in another room
[t] Great value for your money.
price[@][u]##Excellent value at this 
##Gives you all the benefits of gigabit and N speeds and the added bonus of a USB for for a printer or HDD
software[@],port[@]##The sharing software for the USB port is not perfect but still very useful
##Overall a great choice
[t] Verizon / Frontier - Fios - Beware
##This unit worked
speed[@]##However, the connection speed was about 1/20th of what I had before
speed[@]##I read through the forums and tried several things to get the speed where it was supposed to be but nothing worked
##I did end up calling D-Links customer service (great service by the way) and they were able to walk me through several steps of what to try
speed[@][u]##Nothing worked to get the  to where it is supposed to be
##I am not sure if it is compatibility with Frontier (used to be Verizon) Fios (Fiber Optic) or if the device was faulty
##I am sure this would be a great product had it worked with my network
##I ended up returning it for a refund
##I did contact Frontier for a list of compatible routers and they ended up sending out a free replacement router, which worked
##If there were additional ratings for the following
[t] An Excellent Router
##The D-Link DIR-655 provides excellent value for the money
##When my old router stopped working, I turned to Amazon
##Amazon often has the best prices and shipping is prompt
##The router arrived in 3 business days via UPS ground
##Setup was quick and easy
##I have both wireless and wired devices including a wired print server
##I needed the print server on a reserved address and this was simple to do using the router administrative screens
##For the novice or techie, this router is a great choice
[t] Very nice router, easy to set up.
##This is our first wireless router so I was nervous about setting it up properly yesterday
##But it was a breeze
##the instructions were easy to follow and we set it up without problems
##It's in a downstairs bedroom and the reception upstairs says it's low but I can still surf the net without problems
##PS3 was easy to set up and my son is very happy with the speed/connectivity
##May update this review once we've used it a bit more
[t] Excellent N router, anove average G wireless
##I bought this to replace a DLINK DGL-4300 gaming router that was doing ok, but i was having issues getting a good solid connection on my PS3 which was 1 floor and about 40 feet away
##Setup is about as easy as it get with the supplied CD to walk you through
speed[@]##I have a total of 9 wireless devices in the house all but 3 are N capable, and with this modem the speed goes up dramatically and pretty much everywhere in the house i get an "Excellent" connection
##The other 3 devices which are stuck on G i saw marginal improvement in 2, and total loss of signal in the third
##I plan to get N adapters for these 3 in the next few days so not an issue
##Made my 55%-65% PS3 signal more like a constant 80% signal and went from avg 1
##2MB download to more like 8-10MB download
##Vast improvement and i can finally stream HD
##IMPORTANT
[t] Ez installation
##Shipped the DLink to my non-tech daughter in her new apartment 1k miles away
##Anticipated phone support from me would be required but she installed herself and pronounced it "great" in an email
##sent over her new wireless connection
[t] Does everything I need
##As a novice to wireless, I had a few trepidations about getting the right router
##From reviews, it sounded like most models were hard to set up, dropped signals all the time, ran way to hot, were unreliable, etc etc
##I decided on the D-Link DIR 655 after talking to a few friends and reading reviews
##I am glad I did! Again, I had no experience with this type of device, but set up took under 30 minutes and the set up wizard made it very easy
##Our house is 2,000 Sq feet and i can get a strong signal from everywhere in the house
internet[@]##I can go out on the back deck and hop on the internet while the dog plays in the yard
##The device does not run hot
##I waited a month to write a review, and there have been absolutely no problems
##I cannot compare to Netgear or Linksys as I have never used one, but I can definitely say I am very happy with the D-link and would recommend it to a friend!
[t] It has long range
##Tough time hooking it up, had to call tech support
##It works fine after getting some help
##Has a long range
[t] disappointing
##This product was extremely hard to hook up to a dish receiver
##I tried in with my dsl line and it worked fine
##It is advertised to have a stronger signal than g, but it was not stronger than my g
##I would not buy it again
[t] Great piece of technology
##I'm very happy with this device
##Very easy to install and the results were great
##I connected my Computer, WII and my Ipod touch within minutes
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
speed[@]##I recently upgraded my Comcast cable to get a speed boost and found my old cheapo ($20 from Fry's) Airlink 101 wireless router wasn't giving me the additional speed (capping around 12Mbps)
##Despite being told by an "expert" at Fry's that no router on the market would give me much better, I researched the DIR-655 and decided to go ahead with it
##Despite some reviewers claims of complexity to set up, it was easy enough and I am pleased to say I am now getting upwards of 30+ Mbps downloads and up to 8 Mbps upload
##And I am benefiting from gigabit for my local wired connections
##I've not had the opportunity to test the wireless N claims of 300 mbps, but wouldn't get it anyway because my cable doesn't go that fast, but my laptop (54 mbps) is also getting much improved wireless speeds as well - probably double what I was getting
##I've also not had to reboot the router since I've had it (around one month now), which I had to do with some frequency with the ALW101
##Needless to say I am very pleased with this model
[t] invisible
##Kind of a weird title for a review, but this is the word that comes to me when I think of this router - it does what it does very well and I don't think about it or hear complaints from my family any more
##I bought this to replace a linksys router that was constantly giving us spotty coverage and dropping wireless connectivity
streaming[@]##Also, this was one of the routers listed as verified compatible with the Roku player for instant Netflix streaming
##I read all of the reviews on Amazon and other locations and did have some reservation about the excess temperature ("hot")that some people had experienced
##Well, while the router is a little "warm", it is nowhere near what some people described
##Conversely, the reviews that lauded the performance of this unit were spot on
##Coverage is available in all locations of our two story home and on our screen porch, deck, and even into the yard
##Speed is excellent and we have yet to drop a connection
##The Roku unit streams movies seamlessly, with very fast buffering speeds, even in HD
##I usually don't write reviews, but this is one purchase that I am so happy with (another is the Roku player) that I simply had to put in my two cents
##I hope that this helps you in your decision process
[t] Much Better Than Linksys WRT160N Wireless Router
##This is a superior router, especially compared to the Linksys WRT160N
##It is much much faster and operates as described
##WAP Security also works as advertised
##I am very pleased with its operation
[t] Easy as pie
##All I can say is that is the easiest wireless router setup ever
##It practically sets itself up
##The signal is excellent throughout my apartment and my wireless devices found and linked up seamlessly
##I highly recommend this router for people like me (those who know enough to make them dangerous with gadgets) as well as the newbies
##You can't go wrong
[t] Extremely Fast!!
##I did my research before buying this router and I must say that now I see what all the hype is about with this wireless router
internet[@]##My internet connection is great! Faster than ever before!
[t] BEWARE - Doesn't work on my network
##I have setup IT networks for 10+ years
##I bought this as a replacement router at my home
##This was a disaster
##After 10 minutes the router would slow my connection to the point that it was unusable and &lt;10 k/sec
speed[@]##A full router reboot would return the connection to full speed only to degrade again in 10 minutes
##Several others online have mentioned this issue
##My network is not simple, but it isn't horrific either
##I have 1 wired computer, 3 wireless, 1 wired laser printer, and a wired Slingbox
##Some may say that the issue is my ISP, but the problem disappeared when using any other router
[t] Bad experience. I got a defective router
##I was attracted to this router for the same reason as many others
[t] Comcast Challenged
##I must first state that this is the first experience I have had with wireless technology
##I have not had Comcast Cable for that long either so I may be a bit off in this review
streaming[@][u]##i purchased this item primarily to use with my Wii (which is in another room) along with Netflix for  movies
##In this capacity it could not work better
##it is a tad bit slow on retrieving scenes within the movie but downloads and retrievals really only take about 20 seconds max
##I read a lot of reviews on this and other products like it and decided that this would be the best
##Problem
[t] Waste of money
##I have used a D-Ling router for years and decided to upgrade to this "N" router
##After 10+ hours on their support line speaking with about 6 different techs I was finally told it was a defective router and it should be returned for a replacement
##I recieved the same router back
##It still did not work
##I am very familiar with setting up wireless routers
##I contacted the D-Link a second time but did not get a response
##This router was a waste of money
[t] Reboots daily - pass!
##I made the mistake of buying the DIR-655 a few years ago to replace a DI634M
installation[@][u]##The DIR-655 started rebooting within a day of  with the current firmware
##It was a new product so I went back to my old router and tried it again in 6 months - same failure and again another year later (9-2009) with 1
##32NA firmware - same story - reboots every day!I would pass on this router and try something else - if you search on DIR-655 rebooting - you will find many others that have been burned
[t] Kills my computer
##I got the router working without significant problems
##However, I bought it on the promise that I could plug in a hard drive to the USB and share it with computers on my network
##Turns out it doesn't expose a share -- you have to install d-link's "network usb utility" on each computer that will see the drive
##I installed this, and immediately got a blue screen of death on my vista machine
##Rebooting just led to more kernel failures
##I couldn't uninstall in safe mode, and there was no configuration option to turn it off
##Eventually, I was able to unplug the network and reboot successfully, and after trying to uninstall from a full reboot I got
##another blue screen of death
##Router may work fine, but this feature is a dud
[t] Avoid this product it's Wireless features are FLAWED
##I had a D-Link Wired Gigabit / Wireless 108G gaming router, I had no issues at all with it, it performed perfectly
##Recently I got an ASUS 1000H and wanted to update to a Wired Gigabit / Wireless n router and picked this one
##I never experienced the following issues with my previous router
[t] No printer sharing
##Despite all the product description describing the DLink 655 has supporting printer sharing, it doesn't
##In other words, if you want to share a printer through this router you have to buy additional hardware
##I was disappointed in the tech support response - the person who responded was not a native English speaker and was very hard to understand
##More troubling he wasn't knowledgeable and I had hold while he sought other information to tell me that the 655 does not support printer sharing
##Beware
[t] easy set-up
##Being a networking professional and dealing with routers/switches/firwalls/IPS's all day, the last thing I want to do when I get home from work is
##work on another network - even my own
##I had the linksys wrt54GS sitting behind a pix 501 firwall
##The linksys was a real pain to set up, with some of the functional descriptions not making a lot of sense to me
##I spent several hours very patiently working with someone that does not use English as a native language, and in going through a couple of their technical support people that gave up, I was finally able to get this router to talk to the pix
##Linksys may be a cisco company, but it does not integrate well with cisco equipment
##About a year later, the radio in the router developed a problem necessitating a replacement of the router
##With 802
##11N being close completion, I decided to try one, the reviews for the linksys product looked good but I didn't like the heat issue and didn't want to have to replace it again in the near future
##Since my wife works out of our home, it is imperative she have a solid network connection
##I tried the D-link 655 and found it a delight to work with
##Everything made sense as I worked through the setups (I quickly abandoned the wizards, they are useful if the 655 is connected directly to a broadband modem)
##Getting it to talk to the pix was dead simple and very straightforward
internet[@]##After reading through the documentation and attempting/abandoning the wizard, I used the manual setups and had a wireless connection to the internet in less than 10 minutes
##I will soon be removing the linksys wireless adapter card in my home pc (g model) and trying the d-link n adapter but have confidence it will be an easy install
##The only remaining question is how long will this new router last - only time will tell
##I will certainly buy a new one if this one fails
[t] very disappointed
##Would constantly disconnect
##Also VERY disappointed with the configuration interface of it, after making ANY changes to it would require 60 seconds then it would require a reboot
##Doing anything in the config page was SLOW
[t] not good
##I had this for one week and had to return it immediately
##The wireless connection was inconsistent and unreliable and one of my computers couldn't connect to it at all
##But worse, the ethernet router was frequently dropping out and needing to be reset
##When you're playing poker online that's not what you want out of a router
##I'd say skip this and wait for them to make a better router
port[@]##Ironically I also bought the d-link 5 port gigabit switch and that works flawlessly
##Stay away from this one
[t] very good
##I'm very pleased with this product and I'm certainly recommend it
##It's easy to set up and a few hours I have my wireless network o three computers, 2 PDA and a printer working properly
[t] Fantastic Router!
##I love my new D-Link! Threw the Netgear into the trash can and haven't regretted it since
##The best thing about this router is that it sets up easily, has great security, and never fails
##The program they send you with it is a dream
[t] Dlink DIR655
##This is a fantastic wireless router! I have a g notebook card and my wife has a new n notebook card
##The signal is fanatastic for both
##Full reception all through out the house
##Never a dropped connection
##The only bad part of this is D-link's costumer service
##I had a hard time installing it so I called them
##They told me to sent it back cause it will never work properly
internet[@]##One call to Qwest my internet provider fixed that
##It was setup and working flawlessly!!! Don't even bother with their customer service
##but and awesome wireless router!!!
[t] Works Great
##It works perfectly fine on our Mac and PC
##Of course, it is easier to set up on the Mac
##Had a few problems with the instructions as most computers are intuitive enough to set themselves up and the redundancy in the instructions can cause problems
[t] Easy setup, great parental control features BUT ...
##I purchased this router because it was well rated by CNET and other review sites, but had to return it because it did not function well
##Plus
[t] dlink extreme
##Had Dlink Extreme for 2 weeks now,upgraded from linksys G and it works flawless from out of the box
##only reason I did not give it five stars is because its been only 2 weeks other than that its a must have on your router list
[t] GREAT PRODUCT EASY TO INSTALL
##I know nothing about computers and i got this item, plug it and no problems what so ever
##Excellent product
[t] D-Link Pre-N Router
##I love this router!! I did have a hard time initially setting the router up but once that was done it has worked wonderfully! I know have fast and reliable Internet service
##Would recommend this router to everyone
[t] Didn't work as advertised, returned
##I have a DSL modem with an 802
##11b Linksys box and two Macs connected wirelessly, one 802
##11b and one 802
speed[@]##11n I work in the electronics/semiconductor industry and specialize in wired high speed connectivity
##After reading the reviews I bought this D-Link Wireless N Router
##I had nothing but problems with it- browser support for Safari is flaky
security[@]##Couldn't set up wireless parameters with Safari Firefox works OK- Using open wireless security Macs would occasionally refuse to connect with error message- even when mac showed router connected via wireless, often could not open the setup page of router
##- flaky connectivity when connected to internet, latency and performance worse than my 802
##11b router
##After playing with this thing for about 4 hours with multiple settings / channels / combinations of macs on an off to troubleshoot I gave up and returned it
##I didn't even consider it worth bothering calling tech support as there were so many problems, and other reviewers have cited tech support as poor
##I am going to try a Linksys 802
##11n router
[t] D-Link Dir-655 Wireless Router
##The order, and delivery were fast and effecient
##The product works fine as I would expect
[t] Great Router don't consider Linksys
##My second Dlink
##The first is still running after 14 months not a single reset
##I love these things
##My IPAD works on my entire 1 acre property
##Also UPnp works great with Windows Home Server
[t] Wont stream netflix or youtube, buyer beware!
##The 655 worked great for over a year until one day I clicked on the "update your firmware" button on the user interface
##Big mistake
##It installed 1
##21 and it slowed down to molasses and would no longer stream netflix on my LG BD-370 player
##I spent hours that I can never get back to find out that it is a common problem with this router
##The Dlink forums are full of complaints
##Since the router wont let you ever "go back" to a previous firmware version
##I was stuck
##There is an application on line by a Russian developer that hacks the 655 and lets you down grad the firmware backwards
software[@][u]##call me crazy but I dont think it's a good idea to download uncertifed Russian  hacks to fix what is supposed to work from the get go
##I've updated to 1
##33 but it still only connects 33% of the time
speed[@]##The wireless connection speed is now only 65mb/s on N
##Web searches show that sometimes you can be successful
##apparently there are some extensive ports and stuff you can do, but it's far over my expertise
##I either have to replace my blu ray player or the wireless router
##It's easy choice
##Bye bye Dlink
[t] Worked ok at first...
##I purchased this on October 5, 2009--little issue getting it set up, but no biggie
internet[@]##However, woke up this morning with no wireless internet
##I reset to factory settings 7 times and changed the network names, passwords, ect to no avail
##Even took my Mac to the local Mac Store, and it had no problems with their network
##No matter what I have done, I cannot get this thing to work
speed[@]##So, while the speed was good, and I had no other issues for the past three months-it just quit working
##I am so unhappy given the amount I spent on this product!
[t] A self-reboot/frozen router
##This router is a good fit for general purpose as long as you
[t] Best I have owned
##This router replaced an old Zoom which was cutting out and dropping the signal
##The new D-Link supports four processors without any delay or down time, I could not be more pleased
[t] OK router
##Bought this router as a replacement for a Linksys router that I thought was going bad
##Overall the router worked immediately, which is always a good thing! QOS controls in the firmware I found to be a bit lacking
##seemed to have a lot of adjustment options in firmware, but not as nicely organized or easy to understand as the Linksys admin page
antennas[@][u]##Performance of router was just OK - with the 3 movable  - I expected to get a much better signal than the Linksys router, which I did not
##even with the router being 20 feet away with no walls - still only got an 80% signal
##Linksys even got a bit better
##Could not get router to work at all with my Slingbox, despite instructions found online
##Just can't get it to communicate, which is frustrating
port[@]##Spent a couple of hours on it and nothing, even after performing the necessary port openings and whatnot
[t] Great features, bad overheating
##I liked this router quiet a bit, it has excellent features and a very nice admin console
##If it weren't for its fatal flaw, overheating, it would easily be my favorite wireless router I've used to date
##It's not as feature packed as something running DD-WRT, but for me, it was enough that I didn't miss DD-WRT at all
##Now, the overheating issue
##This first started becoming a problem during the first few warm days of the Spring this year
##The wireless would suddenly quit, and the only recourse was to unplug the router, let it cool off, and then plug it back in
##Only problem was, it would only last a few minutes before stopping again
##I then realized I missed part of the clear film they cover the router in to protect it while shipping, which was covering some of the vents on the unit
##After removing the film, I had no more problems
##Until Summer, that is
##During a hot day (>90 degrees), it exhibits the same behavior as it did when I had the film on it during the Spring
##This thing is now completely worthless in terms of wireless
##The funny thing is, mine still works wired
[t] BEWARE! PIECE OF JUNK!!!
##D-Link router sort of worked for awhile; I would have to reset it once a week or more, then finally quit altogether
##Tech support doesnt exist and boy you better not lose your receipt if you'd like them to tell you even the time of day
[t] A disappointment
##Replaced a 5 year old wireless router with this with the promise of improved performance
##Mac(OS-X) and PC (XP)environment
##This new router was slower by far, dropped connections, had much less range, weak signal, and customer/technical support (I think from Somalia) was a travesty
##Same problems on both the Mac and PC
##Reinstalled my old one and am back up and running with no issues
[t] Lots of Features for the Price
##This router is great overall
##It offers tons of features and options for the money
##Although it has many options and features I do wish the interface was a little more user friendly
##Maybe its just me since I was used to my old Linksys WRT54G which had a very easy to use interface
##This router has many features and possible "tweeks"
port[@]##One of the greatest features is the share usb port
##This can be used for a printer or hard drive that can be shared wiith any device on the network wirelessly
port[@]##Also has many other features like in depth QOS settings, port forwarding, application rules and guest network
speed[@]##This router has really great reception and speed
speed[@]##To take full advantage of the speed you do need to be using an "extreme N" wireless card
##If you do though I think you can get speeds of as high as 300MB/s
##The router also has 4 Gigabit ethernet ports
##The Dir-655 looks very sleek stylish in its white color and bright blue lights
##Also comes with a stand and the 3 antenna's which you can move around and position to your liking to maximize the routers performance
##This router has just about every feature any modern router has on the market right now
##Not to mention many great reviews from top rated magazines
##The only thing the router doesnt have that I can think of is the dual band capability
price[@]##It would be kinda nice to have this feature but then again it would bump the price of the router
##I do wish the router was cheaper
##I got it for around $96 plus tax
##Was hopping for something around $80-$90
##I have only owned this router for about a month now so I cant comment on relability
##I hope it lasts some where near my last router (linksys wrt54g)
##Which I had for about 5 years and which is still running today
[t] Great Product at a Great Price
##I have only had this item for a week but so far it has been incredible
##I replaced an old Linksys BEFW11S4 and cant believe i waited this long
speed[@]##The Dlink has been working perfectly and the speed of my downloads seems like its 4 times faster
##If you are looking for a new wireless router this is the one to buy
[t] This router just doesn't work for me
##I can't get this router to connect to my cable modem DHCP
##[
##]On the status page, the DHCP status is "Establishing
##", the firmware version was 1
##21
##I updated the firmware to the newest 1
##32NA from DLink's website and still doesn't work
##I called DLink tech support and it was no help
##They just tell me to reset the router, clone my laptop mac address, power down the modem, power down the router, reboot my laptop
##I know my cable company don't care about mac address because I have plugged many different laptops both Mac and Windows directly into the modem and they all work
##I was just replacing my old Linksys WRT54G to this new N router and the WRT54G works fine
##So after several fruitless try of power everything down, reset the router, the DLink tech support said "I'm going to escalate this to a senior tech support"
##then click, the phone was disconnected
##They did not call back even though they have my name and phone number
##I've wasted enough time on this already so I packed it up and returned it
[t] good router
speed[@]##this is good router for speed and easy setup, But the range is not good compare with my old Belkin Pre-N
##If you look for the range, i think Belkin is No
##1
##All good
[t] Good
internet[@]##Router was easy to install, although I had to do things slightly different, because of my internet connection
##But, it was easy to figure out
##Not sure about how well the router works as far as distance and through walls, but I haven't had any problems with the signal anywhere in my house
##I'm satisfied with it
[t] Glad I bought it
##My first wireless router was a starter D-Link which was inexpensive
##Didn't know the difference
##However, this lasted over 6 years
##I found out they usually have a life expectancy of 2 yrs
##So I really got my money's worth
##Don't ask me why I decided to purchase a Linksys to replace it
##Probably because so many say it is the best
##Well I bought one, and spent 24 hours trying to set it up with nothing but headaches
##Support finally decided it was defective and told me to take it back and exchange it which I did
##However, before I opened it, I decided to check out customer reviews on others
##I found that others had same problems as I with Linksys (of course many had no trouble) but it seemed to follow a pattern
##This D-Link had great reviews
##It was a little bit more costly than the Linksys, but I decided to try it
##Well, needless to say, I was thrilled that it installed without any problem
##I was up and running within 15 minutes (I always read the instructions first)
##Never had to call support once
##A short time later I decided to set up the Wii to the wireless
##Well I wrote down the password wrong, so had to call customer service
##I got a technician so quick, I was surprised
##Within 5 minutes they showed me how to change it and I could give it the one I wanted to use
##I have never written a review before, but decided to do this one so I may save someone else some problems in deciding what to use
##I know there are many out there who think other wireless routers are better and maybe for their situation they are
##But this one is for me
##I have 3 laptops, and one Wii set up and will add PlayStation later
##The reception is great and I use some of my laptops in other rooms
##It works well with both Vista and XP
##This one was more than I really wanted to pay (thankfully Amazon had the best price)and probably a little more than I had to spend
installation[@]##But the time I have saved in installation and ease of use have offset the cost
##My time is worth a lot! Hope this helps you with your decision
[t] Extremely Pleased
##Compared to all the routers that I have purchased in the past this one is by far head and shoulders over all of them
##Just don't make the same mistake I did by simply replacing/exchanging an old router with this new one because you'll end up with an unsecured connection
installation[@]##However, when I followed the installation instructions exactly as they are written, it was a piece of cake
##Couldn't be more pleased with the results - much stronger signal and secure
[t] this thing is garbage
##Seemed pretty nice, when it worked
##Now it doesn't; I can't save settings, 'save changes' reboots without saving anything
##No problem, right? just visit the support forums
##Support forums have _lots_ of people with similar problems
##The best advice seems to be to factory reset - then it'll work for "a little while"
##Lots of folks asking when the new firmware will finally be released
##Support forums also have lots of people regretting updating their firmware - the wretched thing just behaves worse and worse
##and oh, look, the company rep being rude to frustrated customers, blaming everything but the router, and threatening to ban them
##[
##]for good fun, google 'DIR-655 class action'
##There doesn't seem to be one yet, but some interesting stories come up
##somebody should go to jail for the way they're doing business
##buy another brand
##any other brand
[t] rough start but great product
##The overall view of the product is great but was rough getting hooked up
##Followed the CD exact steps but couldn't get it to hook up
##Had to call service twice, both times they were very helpful, The second time did the trick
##I love the D-Link, great coverage all over my house
##We have two laptops both are upstairs, with the D-Link downstairs with the PC
##Haven't tried outside yet but plan to
[t] Great Router
##Bought the router las week to replace a Linksys that constantly dropped the signal
##Installation was easy and I get full bars in my 4500 sqft house
##Very satisfactory performance
##I did not use the wizard to install
##Just got the dsl PPPoE info and configured the router setting via a direct cable
##It took only about 10 minutes
##Highly recommend
[t] Love it! Purchased 1 for 3 locations
##I have one at my home
##Another at my mother's house
##A third is at our office
##This is a fast router, easy to set-up, and easy to maintain
##I've not had to reset any of them in the 6+ months of operation
##That is a far cry different than the Linksys crap I used to deal with or any other brand
speed[@]##I love this router because of its performance, ease of set-up, and blazing speed
##I highly recommend it
[t] Excellent router but....
##I ordered this router on Amazon
##After reading all the reviews and trying two different Linksys, I thought D Link was the one to be tried
##When i received this router, I noticed that the router was already used by someone else as there was a a wireless with SSID already setup
##I had to return the router and re order a new one
##And then it was easy to set up and haven't had any problems with the router so far
[t] No ideal, but pretty close
##D-Link is making it's way to the top of the manufacturers pyramid, until recently dominated by linksys and netgear
##I had many routers over the years, and this one so far pretty good
##Not perfect, but good
##Some glitches here and there, but all crucial functionality is good
[t] It works
##It was a pain to setup, but once I got it working, it has worked perfectly since
##It does give off ALOT of heat so I would recommend standing this unit up, but as for signal, it penetrates all the way down my 70 foot tin can trailer nicely and I mean right now
##I would go with d-link over my former linksys anyday
[t] Worked very well for 5 days...
##Let me start off by saying that I finally decided to replace my Belkin Pre-N router that I purchased in 2006 because of frequent connectivity issues with my wireless devices
##After receiving my DIR-655 I was really impressed with how well this router worked with all of my wired and wireless devices in my house (PC, Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, Roku, and Laptop)
##I used to have to reboot my Roku and Belkin router every time I wanted to watch a movie
##With the DIR-655 all of these problems seemed to vanish, that is for the 5 days that the router worked
internet[@]##Upon trying to get on the internet this morning the power, wan, and all 4 lan lights were flashing in unison
##I unplugged the router for a minute and plugged it back in, this did not help
##Upon running an IPCONFIG from my desktop, it was showing "disconnected"
##So my computer was not even seeing the router
##I then unplugged the router for about an hour, but the flashing lights continued upon plugging power back into the router
##I then tried to "reset" the router with the "recessed reset button"
##This also did not help at all
##I then called DLINK tech support
##They pretty much had me do all of the same steps that I had already performed
##After this they issued an RMA
##Now I have to pay to ship the router back to DLINK
##I'll update after I receive my new router
[t] Good router
##Easy to install, good reception throughout the house
##I have now had this for several months, and so far no problems
[t] D-link Router
##The main reason I purchased this router was to get better signal to another location in my home than I was getting with my g router
##There was some improvement, but not nearly what I was expecting
[t] It's fast
##This router has done what I wanted it to do
##It is fast
##Videos do not stutter
##Can download large files really fast
##No complaints
##Did not receive the set up CD with my initial order
##I contacted the seller, who resolved my issue that day
[t] D-Link Wizard Setup a breeze
##I am not a techie but didn't have to be
##Instructions were clear and the install wizard guided you through the entire setup process
##Up and running in just a few minutes
[t] Update for an old router
price[@][u]##I had to replace an older router, this one was well rated on tech sites, good 
##Got it quickly with 2-day shipping
##It was very easy to set up, the out of the box config worked well
##I was able to swap out 3 computers with no problems
speed[@]##The router has a very strong signal, is able to drive 3 computers & 3 iphones at very high speed
##Stays up with no problems
price[@]##Very good tech for price
[t] Awesome for Gaming
##The PS3 connects very easily to this game with out any hiccups
##Had to replace an old one that was damaged by someone
##Love this brand and the set up is soo easy
[t] It's Okay
##Not as powerfull as I had hoped
##Easy set up just like my previous D-Link
##Good speeds
##No lag time but had to add a booster to get coverage thru out the house
[t] Just what I hoped for
##I am not that computer savvy, but this router was so easy to set up and it has a great range in our large house
[t] D-Link DIR-655 N + 300 Wireless Router
##Great wireless router with excellent range! Setup was a snap, and it has been performing flawlessly to date
##I would hghly recommend this router to anyone!
[t] Best Wi-Fi Range Router
##This D-link replaced a 4 yr old Linksys Wi-Fi N Router
##As with technology upgrades, I needed to upgrade to a router that handles multiple HD Streaming Devices
##This router has 4 wired Gigaports for my PC's & Gaming Consoles & VOIP Internet Phone
##Additionally there is a single 2
##4 GHZ wireless N frequency
##Had I done my research to the fullest, I would've spent an additional $15 to get this same router with Dual Band Wi-Fi frequencies
##2
##4 GHZ frequency is great for web surfing & the 5 GHZ is great for wireless HD Streaming
##I love this router
##I just won't be doing any wireless HD Streaming
##To view the best HD Streaming, utilize 1 of the 4 Eathernet Gigaports on the back of the router
##I will eventually upgrade to the D-Link DIR-825 when my wireless users say they can't all video chat simultaneously on their I-Pads
[t] Router
internet[@]##Router works just fine for our computers and internet TV as well
##We would repeat buying this same router again, if needed
[t] Wireless Router
##This has been working great since we plugged it in
##Everyone likes it and we have had no problems
##Thanks
[t] Very good but...
##I needed a replacement for my old Linksys WRT54G, and I also wanted to upgrade to 'N' std
streaming[@][u]##for  video
##This router was very easy to setup and worked 'out of the box'
##I avoided the setup CD and logged into the router using Chromium on Linux and was setup in short order
##The menus are easy to navigate and setup wizards were helpful
##My only complaint is the requirement to only run the wireless connection using a WEP key
##I usually leave my network open and use a 'whitelist' to limit connections
##I can see no way to do this as the router insists you use a WEP key
##I will check forums to find a way around this eventually
##As a result, my kids' iPod touch's have fault where they lose their WEP kep when they disconnect from the network and it needs to be entered each time they try to connect (Not DLink's fault)I have read that others have had problems with this router, I can only comment that I purchased the router new, not refurbished, and I am completely satisfied with its' function and value
##EDIT
[t] I expected has longer range signal from this router
##I bought this router because it has 3 antenna
port[@]##It is easy to setup and it has usb port to connect usb printer
##The firmware from the programmer wrote is ok because it doesn't hang even it is overload
##the only issue i have is the living room smart TV not connected to it too well
internet[@],speed[@]##I don't think the distance has more than 20 feets tho and my internet speed has 30mbs
##I think i will run the cable for those bad reception instead
##Since i bought this around 70 dollars for this, I think this router is overpriced even i bought it on sale
##I think it worthy around 50 dollars maximum
[t] Didn't work
##I couldn't get it to work
##Had to return it
streaming[@]##I had bought it for the priority it gave to streaming video (I have a ROKU so I stream a lot)
internet[@]##It looked nice, came on time, but I could never get it to connect to the internet
##I had to return it and I got a netgear instead, which has worked great
[t] Junk
##Repeated drop-outs made this a very frustrating purchase
##A slight improvement can be had by giving up on Wireless-N, but even then the router drops out at least once an hour
##This piece of junk will be leaving with the trash pickup on Friday
[t] Great router overall
##Not meaning to belittle any other brands out there, but of all the routers that I've had none has delivered as much as it promised until I got this one
##All things aside when my computer guy referred me to this brand I raised my eyebrow but I have to say I'm so glad I listened to him
##This piece of equipment is the real thing people!
[t] USB port didn't work
##Bottom line
[t] D-Link Extreme N
##I bought this router to replace my old US Robotics
##It does a fantastic job running 3 wireless laptops in 3 rooms of my house, 1 is upstairs
##It was easy to hook up and with just a little configuration on 2 of the older laptops it started running everything with no problems
##It's a nice looking white router with bright blue lights
antennas[@]##It has 3 antennas that you can direct if you need to, I put them in the position that they recommended and it worked great
##I would recommend this to anyone who needs to run computers "through walls" and "upstairs"
##I have old plaster walls & ceilings here and that hasn't been a problem for it
[t] best wireless N router thats not dual band
##I currently have this in my office and a dlink dap-1522 in my living room acting as my media bridge
##The space is probably 20ft in a straight line, but there are 2 walls between them
##Currently my signal strength is 100% and by bandwidth is 270mbps
##Thats 135mbps each way
##For best results you have to use wpa2 only mode with aes encryption
##If you use tkip, for some reason, the router will default to G mode, even if its set to N only
##And that will limit your badwidth to 54mbps, 27mbps in each direction, a huge hit on performance
[t] Excellent Router
##I just replaced my wired network with this wireless n router and the results are fantastic
##I have hooked up to 3 pcs, and 2 macbook pros
##Setup was a breeze
internet[@]##and the internet connection is extremely fast
##Range is also excellent
##I definitely recommend this product !
[t] Overall-Best router I've used
##Title says it all
##I have had many wireless routers from Linksys,Netgear, Buffalo etc
##and this is by far the best router I have owned
##Easy to set up, nice web interfaces and works great in N mode
[t] Excellent Gaming Router
##D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless RouterThis router replaces a Linksys WRT54G
##I Bought this routerD-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Routerto use for online gaming with an X-Box 360 and a Playstation 3
##I also have a PSP on the network and the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router works great
##While I was worried when some reviews suggested that this router was difficult to set-up (as I am by no means a tech wizard) I found this was not so; The D-Link was extremely easy to set-up and maintain as well as monitor its performance
##The default settings for QoS work fine and adding devices takes seconds
##I would strongly recommend the D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router to anyone needing a wireless network for online gaming but doesn't need the headache
[t] DIR-655
##By far the best I have own
##I was devating between the dir-655 or the DGL-4500 just because I play online games with the xbox360 (call of duty 4)but so far I am extremely happy with the results and performance
##The best thing is that all my other wireless connections(b and G) work better without the N card
##About the only negative thing I can say is that there is no USB Xtreme adapter but other than that it works great
##Advice
[t] A Pain to Setup, but it Sizzles!
##My old router was simply too pathetic to support my needs, so I upgraded to this one
##It really solved my problem
##Reception is strong (54 mbps) and video streams from basement to living room just fine, even to my MacMini, which has a fussy location for its internal antenna
##Setup was counter-intuitive
##Normally, you stick in the disk and follow the directions
##Not here
##After you are done, and without a prompt from the install wizard, you have to go online to configure the router
##Here the workflow was not obvious, the steps difficult to understand, and the importance and consequences of decisions not documented
##Chosing a WAP key and implementing it was a pain
##Tech support won't accept calls if the queue is longer than 10 minutes too
##If you don't think you want to sweat this process out, buy something else
[t] Great performance for the money
##We notice much faster connection with the wireless connection with our laptop
##Also, the wired connections seem faster as well
##What more do you want?
[t] Excellent wireless router
##I was searching for a good router and a coworker recommended to me
##Now I've been with this router for 10 months and I have no complaints
##It was easy to set up--just follow the instructions once you connect to the link
internet[@]##I have two younters with laptop each of them and even with their room doors closed they receive internet signals with no problems what so ever
##My son also have XBox 360 and receive signal for all his games with no problems
##I do recommend this product to friends and family
[t] great router
##I'm very happy with this router
internet[@],security[@]##Lots of security settings and I can have my kids internet activity log emailed to me
##Connectivity is excellent
##One thing I'd like to mention
[t] great router, easy install
##i had been frustrated with a badly wired house (100's of feet of network cable all through the attic) and a poor wireless router and not to mention a poor wireless usb adapter too
##but this dlink router has made a great difference
##i just got this router last night and was able to set it up and supersede my old wireless belkin router in about 20 minutes
##the quick setup install disk was very helpful and intuitive with visual instructions of what to do step by step
##after it was set up and my pc's were online it did take me a few minutes to figure how to forward TCP and UDP ports for my eMule application, but after maybe 10 minutes of trial and error eMule was up and running
##the range seems to be very good for our rental house of 2100 square feet
##both the computers that are linked to it are behind walls and doors and one is on the other side of the house
##btw, it helps to have good wireless USB adapters on your pc's
security[@]##the security options seem to be pretty good as i've scrolled from page to page of the advanced options when i was doing some additional manual configurations
##i also like the "guest" feature and have already set it up
security[@][u]##it can use the  key you already have set up or it can use a separate key (or it doesn't have to use a key at all)
##i frequently have guests over while i teach guitar lessons to their kids and some of the parents bring work laptops, so i needed a wireless router with a guest feature
##apparently it can also route to wireless printers but we don't have a wireless printer yet (next home network purchase) so i'd have to reserve comment on that feature
##i bought this along with 2 Media Link USB adapters (the black wireless N adapter) and my wireless home network is now back to amazing!
[t] Wont work with remote desktop
##After 10 hours of fussing I sent it back
##Dlinks cust service blows
##Everything worked except remote desktop, which one might think was a problem in the chair and not the router
##But many many forums showed the same issue and no fix in sight
[t] A Good Buy
##I bought this to replace an older Wireless G model from D Link
##It was, as with other D link products I have purchased, easy to set up right out of the box
##For the person who does not know the difference between a MAC address and an IP address or a Subnet Mask from a Default Gateway the instructions are very clear and easy to follow
##I have it set up at home with two hard wired computers, two wireless laptops and a Belkin USB printer hub and everything works seamlessly together
##A good buy and I recommend it to anyone needing wired and wireless coverage for their home
software[@]##If I could make one suggestion it would be to invest in Cisco's Network Magic software
##For less than $50 it not only allows you to see your network but also to pinpoint and fix problems as well as exercise control (and monitoring) of web sites visited on any computer

[t] Worked great
##Easy to set up and use
##Worked great
##Would recommend and/or buy again
[t] Great product.
##I've owned this product for one week
##So far it has worked very well
##faster speed, more range and more secure
##It was a little quarky to get up and running but once I reset my modem a couple times everything setup easily
##I would recommend this product
[t] Not worth the time, money or hassle - buy a different router
##Where to start
internet[@]##First, I live in Colorado and have Comcast Cable as my internet provider, I am also leasing a Motorola broadband modem from Comcast
##My background, I am a Computer Engineer, with 16+ years of Hardware and Software test experience, including 2 years of testing TCP protocols
##The D-Link replaced a 8+ year old Asante FriendlyNET FR1104-G 802
##11g Wireless Router
##Below is a VERY Short explanation of all the trials and errors that I encountered with the D-Link
##When I first received this product, it worked perfectly out of the box, just as advertised
##However, one month after receiving the product, the unit was unable to acquire a DHCP address from the Motorola modem
##I tried the reset button on the router a number of times before sending an E-Mail to tech support
##To their credit, D-Link tech support responded to my E-Mail in less than 24 hours
##I was told to press and hold the reset button for 30 seconds, as this would reset the router back to the True Factory Defaults
##Viola, the router appeared to be back and running
##After another 45 days or so, the router was again, unable to obtain an address from the modem
##I performed the 30 second reset a number of times, and still was unable to acquire an address
##To help trouble shoot the failure, I attached my old Asante router, and the old girl acquired the address immediately
##Being a little more frustrated, I took the router to work and had one of our network testers take a look at it
software[@]##It appeared to have either a software or hardware failure (possible a cold solder joint)
##At this point, I contacted Tech Support, and into the black whole I went
##After a number of attempts to contact tech support, I finally put the D-Link on the shelve, where it sat for the past 3 months
##By this time, my wife was getting pretty frustrated with the old Asante router (it needs to be power cycled once a day for the wireless to work)
##I decided to try the D-Link one more time, and amazingly enough, it worked immediately after attaching it to the modem
##Well, that lasted for about 2 days, and now it's back to la-la land
##Enough Said
##Could it be the Motorola modem, maybe
##Could it be a lemon, maybe
##Poor Customer Service
##Poor Construction or Firmware (yes, I updated to the latest levels)
software[@]##Does not support DD-WRT software
##Find a better router, don't waste your time
[t] Good router for the $$$$$
##Setup is a breeze less than 30 minutes
##Runs cool maybe the user that complained about overheating never removed the plastic wrap, kind of hard to see
##I've been using the router for a week with no disconnect's
##Much better than my old Netgear G router
##The USB SharePort Utility is kind of buggy
##I'm trying to connect a seagate external backup drive
##Sometimes it works fine other times it will not connect
##Can't figure out what makes it not connect
##I'll update once I solve the problem with USB SharePort Utility
[t] If you have VOIP equipment or are an online gamer; this is the router for you.
##If you have VOIP phone system or are a gamer, this is the router for you
##I received the D-Link DIR-655 router (Amazon sent it so quickly - thank you)
##Here are some interesting facts; with Linksys SPA2102 (VOIP phone) place behind the DIR-655 my download speeds are 50% better
##My VOIP phone quality is also better
##I test my VOIP with a phone call while my son is playing World of Warcraft online gaming; perfect sound quality
##I knew something was up when Linksys (SPA2102) instructions for placing the SPA2102 said if you have a home router, place it behind it
##I thought the SPA2102 was a router? My last router (Linksys WRT54GS) did not have a very good QOS
##I tried to put the SPA2102 behind the Linksys WRT54GS, but the sound quality was bad
##All my routers have the latest firmware
speed[@]##Here is how the place of the SPA2102 in relationship to the DIR-655 affected my download & upload speed
##1st network configuration; Cable modem > SPA2102 > DIR-6552nd network configuration; Cable modem >> DIR-655 > SPA2102Network - Download - Upload - Server2nd - 12915 Kbps - 496 Kbps - Sprint (Fort Worth TX)2nd - 11678 Kbps - 531 Kbps - Broadstar (Miami FL)2nd - 9107 Kbps - 556 Kbps - NYC, NY, USA1st - 5200 Kbps - 555 Kbps - NYC, NY, USA1st - 6040 Kbps - 527 Kbps - Sprint (Fort Worth TX)1st - 4835 Kbps - 518 Kbps - Broadstar (Miami FL)So far, I must give my DIR-655 five stars
##I think I will only buy D-Link Routers from now on
##If you have VOIP equipment or are an online gamer; this is the router for you
[t] Fast, Great Range, Secure and Easily Installed
##I previously had a NetGear RangeMAx 240 router, which was very fast with excellent range, but it fried itself into uselessness one day and I had to find a replacement
speed[@]##In the interim while researching I reinstalled my trusty old LinkSys BEFW11S4 which worked fine but was speed and range limited, as it is 802
##11b
price[@]##Emboldened by PC Magazine's Editors' Choice rating, I sprang for the D-Link DIR-655 from Amazon, which, by-the-way, had the best price I could find anywhere
##The DIR-655 is a terrific router
speed[@]##It's speed is amazing -- I now get 10,000 Kbps down, almost three times what I got with the LinkSys, and equal to the speed of the ethernet-connected PC to which the cable modem is attached
##The DIR-655 works equally well with my PC, my desktop Mac and my iBook
##The range is great, allowing me to connect anywhere in my house, including upstairs
##Setup was easy and completely straightforward using the Wizard on the Install CD, but the wizard is actually not needed by anyone familiar with routers
security[@]##Setting up WPA2 security was also very easy
##and works on both the Mac and the PC
##All-in-all I had no problems in installing and setting up the router
[t] Great Interface!
##This Wireless router has been a joy to use
##It is easily mountable to a wall and is not an eye sore, especially with light colored walls and the white antenae and casing
security[@]##It seems to have so many security settings I might consider feeling safe from hacker attempts (but I'm in an apartment complex, so I know better)
##The Range seems to penetrate walls quite nicely
##I can't testify to outdoor use, but my internal PCI card on my laptop just loves this thing, and to give it full bar performance
##Oh, and when draft 2
##0 came out? Immediate firmware upgrade, no waiting, just get it done! It also has a lot of customization of ports, a wide range of application specific uses
##Ok, now for the few negative things, I'm having trouble getting Folding@Home to receive server updates through the firmware
port[@]##Since it uses http port 8080 for access, it shouldn't have any trouble, but yet it does
##I can't find anything on the d-link forum about this either
software[@]##The Network magic software is pretty much worthless unless you have XP Home, although I did like how it interacts directly with the d-link router
software[@][u]##One BIG negative about this  is that it takes over all print sharing and folder sharing from Windows XP
software[@]##So unless you kill the software (which always tries to stay running in the background), you can't share a printer or folder the old fashioned way
##It won't find it
[t] Xtremely good product
##I bought this the other day along with a D-Link DSL-2320B modem
##The router works beautifully
##Easy to set up and very good signal strength
##The D-Link modem didn't work out and D-Link Tech Support wasn't very good at resolving the issue so I had to take that back
##I connected another modem to the router though and it works great
##I haven't bought a media streamer yet so don't know how that will work but suspect it will do just fine based on what I've seen the DIR-655 do so far
[t] Bad, very bad
##I first purchased this router several years ago, when they first came out and I was very pleased
##The router had gigabit support long before I had my first gigabit network card
##As I added new devices and upgraded old ones, this router performed very well
##As I added devices and services, such as remote secured FTP access, this router never let me down
internet[@]##The very day I was upgrading my internet service to the highest tier, the router died, and I did not think twice about getting the exact same model I had, I was that pleased with it and a testimony to the satisfaction I have had with this product
##That was a HUGE mistake
##D-Link has completely changed the internals of this router, called it the same model, and continued to market this router as the same router, and it is not
##The hardware version went from an A1/A3 to B1 and in a word, it is "horrid"
##Beware, most all of the reviews for this product, dated in years past, are from the old hardware version, and NOT the new version
##Suddenly, my remote secured FTP will not work, my android phone will not connect to WiFi, I cannot get access to some network shares, each time you make a change to the config you have to wait from 30 seconds to 3 minutes to refresh the page which is just awful
##I spend literally days trying to get remote secured FTP working, which it had been working flawlessly for years, and it simply was not to be
##I finally had to either put the FTP server on the DMZ (totally open to the internet) or disable the secured (SSL) aspect of FTP
##It is STILL not working like it should
##I opened all ports from 10-64000, which should be almost DMZ and it still would not work, so even though it says ports are open, they apparently aren't
internet[@]##Again, I spent several hours a day over several days, to get my cell phone to connect to the router via WiFi and to internet to save my data usage, and again, it was just not to be
##I did finally figure out, that if I enabled the "Guest Zone", and used the SSID and password for the guest zone, it worked
##I guess I can be a guest on my own network, and why this has to be, who knows
##After another group of days and hours spent, it finally occurred to me, network shares (connecting to other computers on my network) that had been working great, was suddenly not able to connect
##could this be
##surely not, but yes, it ended up being the router
##Why? Who the heck knows
##But now, when something don't work, I'm not spending days on it anymore, I know
##it's the router
##I routinely check the WiFi and network connections just to make sure no one has hacked in, previously all network connection showed up instantly, but not any more
##My current WiFi connection that I'm using to look at the router doesn't even show up on the screen that shows all WiFi connections
internet[@]##This applies to internet connections as well, some are listed, some aren't
##This is a major problem (as if none of the other con's aren't already)
##While trying to get these problems fixed, I used to be able to enable something on one screen, and pop over to another screen to turn on/off something there
##The old hardware version (A1/A3) you could do this, occasionally a change you would make required the router to reboot, but this was only on a few things, otherwise it toggled from screen to screen, setting to setting as fast as the screen would refresh
##Not anymore!!! Every little check mark and change you make then 'save changes', gives you this "Please wait ___ seconds (and it could be 30 seconds to 180 seconds (3 minutes
##yep 3 minutes)) then you get to click "continue" to get back to the screen (it doesn't just refresh on it's own)
software[@]##Apparently someone that likes to drive a mouse wrote the new software
##The point is, you can do nothing quickly with all the built in delays, it takes much longer- by a factor of several minutes every time you want to change something
##But in the end, it doesn't do much good to change anything anyway, it probably won't work
##I had a number of problems with LinkSys products years ago, and decided to give D-Link products a try, and every single product exceeded my expectations
##They weren't a 'name brand' per se' but their products worked well, and over the years I have added more and more products specifically looking for D-Link brands and chose them over other brands specifically from my personal experience
##That has now changed
internet[@]##If you want, solely internet connectivity and don't expect to WiFi with cell phones, or basically anything else but access the internet, this router IS fast and still does that part well
##Anything else you may need it to do, it probably won't or plan on spending days trying to find a work around
##and your workaround will probably just be
##just don't do that anymore
##It's sad
##Overall, I regret re-purchasing this product a second time
[t] Disappointed in product and Amazon service
##I purchased one of these units a couple of months back
##It turned out it periodically dropped the connection to the (WAN) Internet
##When I contacted Amazon, they promptly sent a replacement for the defective unit
##First issue with the subsequent model - The second unit that I received was a Pre-N model (older hardware version than advertised on Amazon site and older than the first one)
##Second issue - while not dropping as often with the Internet, it was still occurring
##this was verified by a onsite inspection by the ISP technician - they mentioned it is typical for these to start dropping as the hardware goes bad
##Third issue - the Pre-N technology in the second model would not connect above "G" speeds of 54 MBps
##(The alternate model I purchased locally worked just fine for above "G" speeds)
price[@]##Fourth and the most surprising - After the defective units arrived back at Amazon, Amazon only partly credited (70% back) the purchase price to me
##This is not something I expected
##I have shopped with them since 1995
##As a consequence, I am shopping elsewhere for most electronics now
[t] "there's nothing we can do about it"
##Purchased this router a little over a year ago
##Worked pretty good until I decided to subscribe to dlink's securespot service (parental control)
##Well that turned out to be a waste of money
##But whatever, I just cancelled the service and took the thirty dollar loss; no big deal
##Then the problem started
internet[@]##Every once in a while the dir-655 would block internet access to both laptops at home (wirelessly connected)
##I noticed the address bar had a message containing the words "bsecure" plus a whole bunch of other letters
##So I called tech support and they had me log in to the 655, enable securespot and save settings, then disable securespot and save settings
internet[@]##Problem solved! Great, so a few days go by, I turn on my laptop and get the same "bsecure", and no internet connectivity
##So I log in the router and run the same procedure again, which fixes it
##Well, the re-occurences got progressively worse, so I called D-link tech support again
##This time they refer me to the "Securespot" department
internet[@]##It turns out that one of there servers has been going down repeatedly, which would cause it to loose securespot subscriber data, which resulted in not only my internet getting blocked, but countless other people that had also subscribed to securespot
##So the customer representative admitted this was an ongoing issue with securespot subscribers and that "there's nothing we can do about it"
##So I'm left with having to go to my desktop, log into the 655, perform the resetting procedure, everytime I want to use my laptop
##And the best part about it is that adding securespot required a firmware upgrade, which guess what, is not reversible! And D-link's response to that
[t] Worst dlink product I have used
##Have been using this router for the last 2 months or so
##I have already returned one unit for replacement, which cost me $15 in shipping under warranty because dlink does not cover me shipping the unit to them (didn't know this!)
##second unit is still just as unreliable
##reception is not any better than my older g router
##wireless connection is laggy and slow
##lose connection every so often
##customer service is horrible (they claimed that these are happening due to my ISP yet I had been using the same ISP w the old router w no problems)
##so far I am sorry that I have upgraded to n
##stay away from this router
[t] D-Link is Worthless
##I purchased this wireless router after much online research and speaking with D-Link Customer Service BEFORE I purchased it online at Amazon
##D-Link confirmed that I could add this wireless router downstream to my existing D-Link DLG-4100 router to establish a Wi-Fi network in my house
##The DLG-4100 is in my basement where my cable modem is located
##After opening the box and trying for an hour unsuccessfully to accomplish this, I called D-Link technical support twice -- only to find out eventually that I need a wireless bridge instead!!! Right-hand left-hand
##And I come to find out that Amazon wants at least 15% and maybe 20% to restock because the box is opened
##Very, very frustrating
##Make sure you know what you really need, however you can, before you buy anything from Amazon and D-Link
##P
##S
##I did some more online research -- thank goodness for the Internet -- and spoke with one of our IT people at work
##It is possible to use this router connected to another router
##This connecting or cascading set of routers is described at these two links
[t] Painless install with Setup CD; Win 7 network dream
##I finally gave in to a new router to replace my Microsoft MN-700 that is 12 years old -- it was becoming a little unreliable in its old age
##I picked the DIR 655 based on ratings, particularly its higher prospect of being easy to install and maintain (although, it, like most routers, certainly has its share of complaints and bad customer reviews)
##I only had to make one call to Tech Support before I began the install -- to confirm a specific, simple protocol at the first step -- and then I was off
##Once I got set up with a laptop near the wall-cabinet router location, it only took about 10 minutes at most to run through the CD install wizard routine, and everything went as programmed
##Within 20-30 minutes, I had one wireless laptop, two wired desktops, an Xbox 360 and a ROKU media device all working and recognized in the Windows 7 Homegroup I had set up earlier
##It could only have been easier if D-Link had come to the house to do it for me
##I immediately took the laptop outside to test its range
##I got about 100' when it dropped to two bars, and that was perpendicular to the antennae array and through an outside wall sheathed in corrugated metal
##At an upper-floor office location inside the house where it is often in use (about 30' away), it held a full 5 bars, one-two more than the old router
##It appears to be much faster in delivering media
##e
##g
##, online videos no longer stop for buffering
##Browsing and other online activities seem to be as fast as my desktop with similar tech specs
##Two more comments
[t] great
##great product and i have not had any p[roblems with it
##works consistently and is fast with computers, ipads and game system all at the same time
[t] DIR-655
##Verizon FIOS Actiontec and Dlink DIR-655 pair up very well
##You need to configure both routers to get them both to perform well as the dlink is my secondary router i use it mainly for all wireless purposes
##and everything has a 100% connection on all 3 floors
##It was well worth the money and a major upgrade from the sluggish fios main router
[t] Router
price[@]##fast service good price and I would tell my friend to buy from this web site ,D-link had good tec support it made it easy it if you need help to install it
[t] Still in a process.
##There are some concerns, need more time to findout
##Installation process is not easy as advertised, considering set up all devices
[t] Good router
internet[@],speed[@]##I had a belking 54g before and i upgraded my internet to higher speed so i got this one
##I had this router for about 2-3 years
##Its good but recently the connection has been lagging
internet[@]##It's not disconnecting but i have to manually disconnect and then reconnect to get the internet to work again
##Kind of annoying
##Not sure if it has something to do with my cable modem
##I plan to take my cable modem back to comcast and get a replace because it also drops connection alot but then the problem seemed to transfer to the router
##I tried releasing my ip and then renewing it and it doesnt fix the problem long term
##So not sure whats going on
##When i had my belkin, never had a connection issue
##I've seen other dlinks do this though
##I was going to go with a belkin again before i bought this but there was a problem when i changed routers and it had a conflict with my ip address
##I didnt know what to do so i got this one instead
internet[@]##It didnt fix the ip address problem, i had to call the internet tech support and all i had to do was change the ip address on the router itself
##So i could have kept the belkin
##Overall its a good router but its been finicky lately
[t] Excellent Router##When I purchase this Router ,I did not expect that it would work, so good
##did not know the router was one of the best out there at the time & still going strong
[t] I've purchased 2 of these units...
##for friends I was living with and not for myself
##They work very well, receive consistantly high reviews, and are quite affordable
##When I moved out one of my friends returned the router to me because he no longer needed it
##I am going to pass it on to another fortunate individual because I already have a good router in my home and have no use for the extra one
price[@]##But, yes, this is a great router at a great price
[t] Good router for the price

[t] Strong wireless router
##Works wonderful for integrating wireless components into a home for TV and tablets
##I would highly recommend this router to someone looking to bolster their wi-fi signal
[t] What a super router!
##What a great product!! I have full bars on my network wherever I go in the house
installation[@]##Easy fast installation and very colorful LEDSmake it fun to run!!!!
[t] GARBAGE
##I bought this router from amazon, due to its positive reviews
##The first one arrived DOA, with dlink offering minimal phone support
##The second one has been functioning
##like garbage
##I have a 900 sq ft loft (meaning that its pretty much open), and I lose wifi reception 30 feet away
##The power socket on the back has to be taped to the router in a certain way in order for it to power the device, and it needs to be reset on the reg
##This was my first kind of expensive router, and I am really disappointed
##I had a $20 netgear that worked much better
##Oh and if you want to plug a hard dive in this router
##its a colossal pain
##You have to pair the devise that you want to access the HD with, and then when you are finished, you have to un-pair it
##If you don't un-pair it, you wont be able to access the HD with any other devises
[t] great!
##My bro could get on my network 2 houses down! that's how far this thing reaches! Highly recommended!! Happy I researched and decided on this one
[t] D-Link DIR-655 N+300 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##Great product
##Looks good, and doesn't take up much space
##Can handle several laptops, a desktop at once along with an I pad
##Delivers as expected
##Would recommend this
[t] Very good equipment.
##Was realy very easy and fast to set up
##The wireless perfomance is realy good
##Yes I recommend to friends
[t] Worked as advertised.
##I had printer problems and Epson said that the router was at fault
##I contacted D- Link customer support who patiently diagnosed the problem which turned out to be the printer after all
[t] Drops WiFi connection, only fix is to reset or cycle power
speed[@]##Purchased this router a couple of years ago to replace an old Netgear which worked fine, because I thought this would give faster wireless speed
##Was never quite impressed with the WiFi performance, but lately it's really been a problem
##Both my laptop and Blu-ray WiFi connections would just stop working completely
##Usually on the laptop I just turn off WiFi and turn it back on, and it finds the connection
##But recently this stopped working
##I would re-enable Wifi, it wouldn't find the network automatically - so I would have to select it from a list
##Then it would not accept the password which was entered correctly
##The only fix was to go down to the router and cycle the power, which would fix the issue
##This started happening more and more frequently, and then even cycling power wouldn't work - I had to re-do the initial set up
internet[@]##Through all this the connected internet worked fine - it was just a wireless issue
##I finally decided I'd had it and I just ordered another, newer, Netgear router
##I will never purchase another D-Link router again
[t] Nothing But Problems
##When connected directly to my cable modem, I have no problems, except that I have no WiFi
##Using the Dlink 655, I have constant problems
##I loose connectivity on all devices once or twice every day and have to reboot the Dlink
##I also get conflicting IP addresses issued which is not good
##I have run the setup and reset the Dlink to factory condition several times
internet[@]##At times I have not been able to make the Dlink have an internet connection at all
##I am an IT professional and I know about routers and modems, yet I cannot resolve this
##I cannot say if this just a one-off bad router or not, but I mine is no good
[t] Constantly dropping wifi, and stopped working after 1.5 years
price[@]##I purchased this one because of the price and gigabit lan
##I've been using this for 1
##5 years
##At first, it was occasionally dropping the wifi signal, and I had to restart the router once in every month
##I did not think that it is a valid reason to return
##Then, it started to happen more frequently as time passes, and now everyday I have to restart it again
##More than that, now even after clean restart, and re-install, and upgrading the firmware, the wifi is so slow and has a huge lag to the point that it is unusable
##I've read from the reviews that, i am not the only one who have the same problems
##Would not recommend
[t] Pretty good choice
##It works pretty well, but it needs to be flashed to the latest Firmware
##All and all a good buy
[t] so kool
##Good product for everyday use
##I would purchased this product again
##especially at a 2 for 1 deal
##or a 50 percent off deal
##as I write this with you I am using this product right now
[t] Excellent Product!
##This product was very easy to install
##I pluged in, entered secuity info, user id, and pw and the solution was up and running within min
##I had the gamerlounge and was having issues with VoIP and connectioin issues
##This router is the bomb!! Great job and good product!
[t] Second copy works well
##The first router that was sent did not work
##It took a considerable investment of my time to convince myself, and then D-Link, that the router was defective (including being disconnected multiple times while waiting in various queues between service D-Link service reps)
##The reps were all courteous and professional, but the long and arduous process and the repeated dropped calls where ridiculous
##Very frustrating, but unfortunately typical of customer service quality these days
##After all was said and done, they suggested that I send it back to Amazon to get a replacement
##That process when very smoothly; Amazon immediately sent a new router and paid for the return of the defective one (a real benefit of ordering through Amazon)
##Once I had a good copy, the router was easy to configure and works as advertised
##The signal strength and connection speeds are great and I haven't had any issues with the wired or wireless connections
##It works fine with my sons X-Box, which was the one concern I had
##The admin pages are laid out nicely and it's easy to locate what you need
##It was also fairly painless to upgrade the firmware version
##I'm only knocking off a star because of receiving a bad unit and having such a long and frustrating experience with D-Link customer service
[t] D-Link DIR 655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##Product was easy to install and worked great
##I would highly recommend this product
##Arrived in 2 days
[t] D-Link Router
##Excellent router; much easier to set up than LinkSYS; good range -- greatly improved my WiFi access throughout the house and outside
[t] Dlink DIR-655 Best Router I have found
##I purchyased the DIR-655 along with the various D-Link adapters (DWA-652 for notebooks and DGE-530T for desktops)
##Prior to that I had a Netegear 624 G running at 108 mps
##Before that I ran a Netgear B router so I have run a number of routers
##Plus I have set up other types of routers for other people
##This Dlnk equipment is giving me great speeds
##My 2 notebooks going through about 4 walls gives me 300 mps
##The desktops are giving me 1 gbs
##I did have to update the firmware when I got it because it was not displaying my wireless devices correctly
##Very easy to do this upgrade with this router
##Function is built in
##Setting up wireles security, which you absolutely neeed was also a snap
##It was very easy to install
##I would absolutely recommend it, but buy the entire package including the adapters
speed[@]##It did work fine with my G adapters, but you get so much more speed from the N adapters
[t] comment on customer service
##I have only had this up and running for 2 days now
##Seems to be working fine
##I have a two story house and I get connections in any room
##I was Online for about 4 hrs with no interruption
##Hook up was awfull!!! called d-link tech
##support 4 times with the same answer from everyone and they didn't seem to care that everyone was telling me to unplug wait hook back up etc etc
##was not working
##The language problem with each person was not fun!! Finally I hung up and sent an email so that english wasn't a problem anymore and got an answer
##I was on the phone with this company from 7 to 12 that night
##One simple problem, the email instructions said that I needed to change my IP address on the router because my dsl provider (shentel) was using the same IP address and that is why i could not get a connection! I would not recommend if you are not an IT person and may need help with hook up do not get anything through d-link because the tech support is really bad!!!!!!
[t] Not Perfect But Well Worth My Purchase
##This item works extremely well
##The wireless coverage is great
##There is a mass amount of configurable settings and options which I love
##This could be a little more user friendly for the non tech-savvy, even though default setup is very simple and usually "good enough" for the average person
##For IT Guru's I think it offers more than enough features and settings to accomidate just about any home network
##Works great with torrents and setting http request priority so as to not bog down your web surfing with massive downloads
##Just wish it had more wireless mode options
##Can't get 108Mbps Wireless G, but can get 54Mbps and Wireless N

speed[@]##It has decent wireless range even through walls, and the speed is also satisfactory
##Every thing worked right out of the box
##Setup was a snap
[t] Great Purchase...
##I bought this product about a month ago after my old router was fried last summer when lightning hit our house
##It took about 15 minutes to set up and has run without a single problem ever since
##It was a great purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a router
[t] no problemo
##After spending twenty, yes twenty, hours on the phone with people I could hardly understand much of the time, I finally gave up on the Linksys router 610n
##Five case numbers and about six techs could not get two computers working properly
##The dropped connections, the stifled URLs, the constant rebooting to re-establish a connection all got to be too much
##So I bought the D-link 655n and without a care in the world I got it hooked up and running beautifully with no dropped connections, no stifled URL, and no rebooting necessary
##What a blessing to have a technology actually work
##And I did it without a call routed to India
##Cysco, what were you thinking?
[t] Overheating problem with D-Link DIR-655 router
##I have just solved a problem with intermittent WAN connections and overheating with this product
##On hot days (today it's 85 degrees in my office) the D-Link DIR-655 router overheats when handling a lot of local network traffic (copying big files between computers) and drops the WAN connection (to the cable modem)
##Before this happens, there is short period of intermittent or unreliable connectivity to the WAN
##The LAN still works fine, however
##I tried swapping in another DIR-655 router, same problem once the thing warmed up
##I added an external fan blowing on the router case, and everything is happy again
##The air-cooling slots in the case are very small, and the case feels very warm (without the fan
##)I have no problem having the extra router, though
internet[@][u]##After all, a single-point failure of the router kills all my  connectivity
##Except for the overheating problem, I like this product, the wireless connections work fine, and would recommend it (just think about keeping it cool
##)
[t] Very reliable - By far the best router I ever purchased.
##I had this router a little over 6 months
##I bought it mainly based on the good reviews found here on Amazon website
##It exceeds my expectations
##The wireless signal is very strong
##I have the router in my basement and I get the signal everywhere through out the house, the back yard, front yard and I bet my neighbor sees the signal too (BTW, it's secured)
##The router has been on 24/7 for over 6 months I I haven't had to reset it once
##My last Trendnet and Linksys routers needed a reset every few weeks or they refused to connect wirelessly
##I highly recommend this router to anyone who wants a reliable gigabit and wireless-N router
##It obviously one of the best product in its class
[t] DIE-655 Is a robust router
##Fairly easy to setup although the new plethora of options and some minor changes to older model setup is somewhat different
security[@][u]##The first machine was the easiest to add while the second and third were a bit more confusing since different OSs would not accept the autogen  key which I had to figure out how to change
##Once setup it has worked flawlessly for me using 3 ports continuously, 2 wired and 1 wireless under heavy load
port[@]##Additionally the uPNP port forwarding required by many newer programs seems to be supported and working flawlessly as well
[t] Great Range
##Mine is a wireless network in masonry and steel building with the modem and router about 100 ft
##from the wireless device
##My first router was a Netgear WNR-3500
##It did a fair job, with two or three bars
##It was replaced it with a D-Link DIR-655 and the 655 gives a consentient four bars with no fluctuations
##The 655 at least in my application is vastly superior
[t] Smoking
##FAST router - easy setup - excellent technical support - best wireless router I have used to date and I have used many
speed[@]##Excelletn range and speed
##Actually I use this as an access point and it is superb
[t] Excellent !!
##Easy to setup, works without any drops or, hickups
##I didn't experience anything that I can carp about this product
##Lastly it is much better than similar routers from competitors
##Hoping the upgrade to 802
##11n final spec in nov 09 will just be a firmware update
##D-link just rocks !
[t] 12-11-08 Currently a great deal for the money.
##12-11-08 Currently a great deal for the money
##I did a lot of research and yes there are better devices out there but you're going to pay for them
##This is a rapidly changing area so I choose the middle of the road price/feature wise and spent around $100+
##I realize I will need to purchase another one in a few years anyway so why pay $300+ for something that overheats
##It's fast, easy to setup (I'm techie), shared printer works well and works with different operating systems (have Vista and XP)
[t] My house seems to jam most electronic communications. This thing works for me.
##My house is a late 60s post modern house built into the side of a hill on several levels on several concrete slabs
##Solid walls, 3400sq ft and L-shaped
##Wireless communications of any kind are very difficult inside the house
##The hill blocks the cell phone towers, and the slabs and angles and walls seem to block wireless activity inside the house itself
##My cordless land-line phone ( http
[t] Best router I have owned
##This router is everything I want out of a router
[t] Easy to set up and use
##My first foray into lan stuff
##Router was easy to set up and install
##The router management pages are easy to understand and use
##The help section and phone help line were also awesome
##I hooked up two computers and two printers with full sharing, no problem
##My only problem was I had to add an extra MAC address to use my laptop wirelessly
##I fugured it out using the help section
##The signal is strong as I get on wirelessly from one story up and 70ft away with all the doors closed
price[@]##Good buy at a good price
##I do wish it had a printer server for going wireless to my downstairs printer (I will be buying a d-link printer server for that purpose) but I can easily use the upstairs printer through the wireless
##The unit has a USB to connect a mass storage device where I can back up all my files easily
##Tom
[t] Fast and stable
##The DIR-655 provides more than what I expected in a wireless router
##My research found this router to be rated highly by experts and users alike
##The options and configuration can be somewhat daunting for novices whereas experienced users will enjoy the control they can apply to their networks
##I have various devices connected to it (Apple TV, Skype phone, NAS, LCD TV and wireless destops and laptops) and all of them run really well
internet[@]##I am able to redirect mySynology NAS Disk Station DS107+ High Performance Single Bay Network StorageFTP & HTTP features through the router seamlessly and have wireless bandwidth to access the internet
##The DHCP client is more reliable than my previous 3Com wireless router
internet[@]##I just wish the broadband internet provider would be as reliable as this router
##I did experience problems with the wireless WEP encryption when connecting Apple wireless devices, this was overcome by disabling WEP and limiting access to selected MAC addresses
##Good buy
[t] Worth EVERY penny!
##I was beyond frustrated with my Internet connection so I decided to invest in a better router
##OMG! It is fabulous
##flawless connection! I highly recommend it!
[t] This is probably the best router ever
##it definitely was not the easiest to setup but the results are amazing
##I'm on my laptop in the other room and the pages load up instantly, in the blink of an eye and it doesn't slow down our PC when my roommate is downloading a video simultaneously
##so worth ever penny
##of course i got it at a huge discount here at amazon
##85% off so i paid just under $100
##mega score
[t] Good Results
##We used this to make our church's office wireless and got good results despite the fact that it is a brick building with thick walls
[t] Rock Solid
##This router rocks! It is easy to set up, has loads of functionality, and it even looks cool
##Its rock solid and stable
##I highly recommend it
[t] Tom
##I do not use it
security[@][u]##Too difficult to configure for the printer option and it seem to exhibit a  flaw
##I noticed a printer on my network that is is not in my house

[t] Este router no sirve..
##buenas amigoseste router no sirve para nada
##es mas publicidad que otra cosa no tiene nada de alcance es solo publicidad
##no se lo recomiendo a nadie
[t] Biggest Piece of hardware Crap you can buy!!!!
##The DLINK DIR(T)is One of the most expensive wifi routers out there and you can expect horrible results
##First DLINK has THE WORST support you will find anywhere!! Totally crappy service and then when the warrenty is up they charge you over $35 for 30 minutes of support, whether they can fix it or not
##Let me tell you, based on my experience, I was on the phone for over an hour and a half and they had NO CLUE!!! I went to the 3rd level and Duhhhhhhh
##Nothing!! The product worked for over a year with little problems and then all of a sudden, my access would cut off again and again
##SO #$&*% frustrating!!!!! I had my cable company come out to verify it wasn't my broad band and it wasn't
##The cable guy was very cool and tried everything to rule out the broadband
##He guarenteed me it was the DLINK DIR(T)-655 white piece of crap!! I bought a Linksys Wireless-G 2
price[@]##4GHz for half the price of the D(umb)LINK DIRT-655 and it works even better than the DLINK DIRT-655 ever did
##Man it is fast and with a name like Cisco behind it, it really gives me the piece of mind my systems will run around the house without anymore hiccups
##No cutting out at all
##Fast and Furious
##STAY AWAY from DLINK people!!!! DLINK Service and their overpriced router, The DIRT-655 SOCKKKKKSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!! Just do a search on Google and find the hundreds of links that complain about how the DIRT-655 cuts out!!! Also the SecureSpot is a ripoff
##Cisco's product uses OpenDNS and it's FREE!! Protects your computers and devices in the house from all the porn and crap out on the internet!!! For all you porn addicts, don't worry, you don't have to sign up for it, but I would highly recommend you did
##DON'T BUY the DLINK DIR-655 folks
##RUN RUN RUN to the others! I promise you won't regret it!!
[t] Don't purchase this D-Link product!!
##I bought D-Link DIR-655 last October through Amazon
##com
##For 3 months,it had worked well
##(not excellent, though)However, one week ago, after I tried to update DIR-655 it didn't work at all
##Moreover, what drive me crazy is D-Link's support
##Although I have contacted D-Link several times,they just gave me service phone number that always says me 'waiting' whenever I called to them
##They never provide any reasonable service to me for the problem so far
##I recommend you do not purchase this product unless you believe this would be never broken
##You can not any service from D-Link
[t] wastes your time and money.
##Pros
[t] Not as good range as I expected
price[@]##I ultimately returned this and put in a Belkin that was less than half the price and actually get more range with the Belkin
##I have a 1850 sq ft house and I wanted to be able to use the wifi in the back yard but didn't get much of a signal with this Linksys
##Very disappointed
##Belkin has slightly stronger signal and I've been very happy with it
[t] Junk!
##One of the worst routers and a total waste of time
##I got the B1 version and it did not pass Port 0 and 1 scan tests
security[@]##Contacted tech support about this serious security flaw but they never got back to me about it
##So I returned it for a refund
##Also, the Shareport utility for accessing an attached NAS is a dumb design
##No built-in media server is also a negative
[t] bad product
##This is just a badly designed product, does not function fully, returned to Amazon next day
[t] Worst router of all routers I've ever used
##This has to be the worst device I have ever setup
##And the range sucks if you can even see it
##Most devices cant even see it 98
##65% of the time
##And I am between 5 and 30 feet away from the device
##4 different wireless devices a Dell laptop, A Desktop with a DLink wireless G card, A Palm TX, and a Blackberry can't connect to it
##Not with wep or WPA
##I've spent over seven hours and have not been online more than 15 minutes wirelessly
##In comparison the last year I have completely wiped and deleted all the settings on my Linksys on at least three different occassions
##I had completely setup and added all 4 devices back onto the network in about an hour tops
##No saved settings, documents, or anything
##Plugged in the Linksys disk, ran the utility, added devices in the router, setup mac address access only, wep,ect
##This DJunk router supposed to replace an aging Linksys that is starting to go
##But for the life of me I can't get devices to connect
##And wired the amount of time a website takes to load is three times as long
##My blackberry as a modem actually connects to the web faster and loads the pages faster
##By far the worst router I have ever owned
##I'm not even going to try a replacement
##If its slow wired it is worthless
##Actually it works worse than the old netgear 802
##11b I was on 10 years ago and its slower wired
##I know because I hooked it up in a couple hours a month or two back to test it
##Maybe I got a bad unit but I'm not going to chance it on another one of these units
[t] Don't Bother there are better routers out there
##Router works OK not great
##Have to either restart or diagnose problem to reconnect everytime I use it and the laptop is only 5 feet away from router
##Will keep it only because its here but will not recommend
##Get a better one than this if you want to enjoy your router's performance
[t] Easy to set up! Good performance.
##I just have with this router like 3 months and since i setup it, it has been working well, with not losses and i don't even have to restart ir or something
##Has a good range, good performance and i recommend it
##Hope that this should help you to decide, good luck
[t] so far so good
##Just upgraded our old Linksys 802
##11b router
##I was wondering if I would have any issues with the installation, based on other reviews
installation[@]##Happily, installation was quick and painless
##So far the performance is great
##Web pages are loading significantly faster
##For the wifi ubernerds, there are tons of settings which I will probably never touch, but that you can tweak to your hearts content
[t] D-Link's DIR-655 - An Excellent Router!!!
##Replaced my WRT A+G wireless router after it died
##Having read good reviews about the DIR-655, I decided to get it as my replacement wireless router over the weekend
##Installation and set-up was a breeze - the router was working in less than 15mins
##I immediately noticed increase B and G coverage and constant data rates of 48-54mbps almost all over my house (2-floors) and garage
##I have 2 desktops (wired), a PS3, 360, Wii, PSP, Touch, and 5 notebooks connected to this router
##I paired this to D-Link's wireless N card - the DWA652 and works even GREAT! I got constant 300mbps connection all over my house!
[t] Strong, dependable, gamer friendly
##The DIR-655 worked as promised
##I wanted it to be hidden, provide strong wireless connection for me and my wifes' laptops, and provide strong wired connection for Gaming for my kids
##I placed it in the rafters in my basement and I'm happy with the wirelsss reception I get throughout the house (I have a ranch style - one floor)
##My kids were able to set up and host online gaming easily and I was able to configure it pretty good
##Although I have not converted to Cat6 cabling, the wired computers reported they were connected at 1000Mb and it seems large files like movies and backups go quicker with the gigabit wired connection on my internal network - even with my old CAT5 cords
port[@][u]##The only downside was that nobody could answer what the USB  was used for on the router
##The best answer I got was from a tech support guy who said that USB support was "to be enabled with a future Firmware Uddate"
##Guess I still have to plug my USB mass storage into my box until then
[t] Great router!
##Previous router was a Netgear wireless G, that was issued to us from Time Warner with our "home networking" package
speed[@]##After going through 2 of those and still unable to fully appreciate high speed internet, I purchased this router
##We have 2 desktop computers, an xbox360, and 2 wireless laptops running off of it, with no interruptions
##Set up was very easy
##Highly recommended!
[t] Good range, reliability and speed
##I have not a chance to test this router with 802
##11n devices, but I've had no problem setting it up with wired devices (at Gigabit speeds), and G and B devices, including older desktops, laptops and PDAs
##User interface was straightforward, and the range and reliability is significantly better than my older 802
##11g (Wireless-G) router
##So far, a very satisfactory experience
[t] Best Draft N Router on the Planet
##I replaced an Older D-Link router and TWO Linksys rang extenders with this one unit
speed[@]##Coverage and speed are great
##Easy to config and set-up
[t] Very Good
##My house is small, so it's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls, but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners, with no signal interruptions
software[@]##The model is also very clean and nice, and the software is very user-friendly
##These were only my first week impressions but, until now, I strongly recommend this product and I'm very satisfied with it
[t] Flawless router
##Worked flawlessly out of the box, but due to my outmoded wireless adapter software, I had some problems with the wireless encryption
##After updating the Intel wireless adapter driver on my laptop, I was able to install the encryption without further problems
[t] Works like a charm
##My wife reported intermittent connectivity issues and I decided to update my 5 year-old router
##I took the advice posted here to "throw away the instructions"
##Here's what I did
[t] Poor Installation
##You can NOT easily upgrade an existing wireless network with this router, nor is it easy to start a brand new network
internet[@],installation[@]##First off, it REQUIRES an internet connection to run the installation program
##Next, it REQUIRES that you hardwire the router to a PC
##If you can not do both of the above, then steer clear of this one
[t] D-Link 655 modem
##Fast install, easy to use and impressive manf
##service (concurrent & active modem monitoring)
[t] Smokin Router
streaming[@]##We upgraded our entertainment system to include an Apple TV and utilizing wireless streaming for the movies, noticed that sometimes there would be a long pause of about 5-40 seconds
##After installing this wireless router there are no more pauses when watching a movie
##Also takes care of three computers total and VOIP telephone flawlessly
[t] Excellent. Works great with uTorrent and Skype.
##I originally bought a wired ethernet router from Linksys but was disappointed with the frequent disconnects with skype voice calls and needing to change configs to work with uTorrent
##Then I tried this Dlink recommended by a friend who does a lot of gaming
##actually they recommended a different dlink router that uses gamefuel, but that recommendation led me to the dlink website where I found this one mentioned
##It specifically targets p2p and voip use
##and wow they did a great job
##All I had to do was hook it up and follow the simple wizard to get it working
##No configs
##this supposedly recognizes p2p and voip apps through its traffic and enhances for it
##I was originally skeptical about using the wireless part of it, since my past experience was it was very slow
##but it must have been cheap routers
##because this router is very fast, even with the wireless connections I am able to maintain good voip connections
##Also, I read some past reviews says this router is very hot
##I noted they were old posts from 1+ years ago
##I got this one about a month ago and saw it has a firmware dated late 2008
##and I don't feel much heat at all coming from it
##So dlink must have addressed this issue in recent versions of this router(?)
##Excellent
[t] was rated as best router
##works great
##easy to setup
##but configuring some settings were a little confusing
##like setting the password for wireless signal
##this is rated as one of the best routers
[t] Great router
##Speed is great! Easy to set up
##Only problem is compatibility with iTunes - no dice
##but works fine with media player and my soundbridge once I fiddled around a bit with it!
[t] D Link Router
##shipping was a little slow (5 days later than projected) but product is awesome so far
[t] Great signal...
##Goes faster than my old linksys G
##more configure to protect and control my home network
[t] Easy setup for Mac and Windows
##I bought this router to create a wireless network for a new iMac (802
##11n) and aging Dell laptop (802
##11g) with a cable modem
##It was easy to setup and works great
##The signal strength on both computers is strong throughout my abode, through all kinds of walls
##It has all kinds of options (which I don't really use)
##If there is a flaw, I'd say it is the USB port, which is basically useless
software[@],port[@]##You have to install software on your computer for it to recognize the port
##And only one computer can use the device at a time
software[@]##And the software you need to install is Windows-only
##I'm hoping a future firmware update will provide enhanced capabilities
[t] Works ok ... not easy to use
##works ok, but isn't very easy to use
##all the screen settings are embedded so you have to search and tab and search
##Annoying
##why they just couldn't put all the wireless settings under "wireless" and all the "port" settings under port, i don't know
##the instructions tell you what something is BUT NOT WHERE to find it
##the Wireless doesn't rate as fast as my linksys either
##solid product, but definitely not user friendly imo
[t] Good price, very poor support!
##I purchased this router to upgrade my network from a 10/100 Ethernet, b/g wireless to 1Gbs Ethernet, b/g/n capabilities
##Previous router was a Netgear product serving faithfully for 5 years
##I am not an experienced network person, but have better-than-average computer skills supporting a network that has Win2000, WinXP Pro and Win7 Pro Dell laptops
##I needed technical network support to implement a new router on a 6-computer, mixed OS network
##D-Link support (Phillipine based) was unable to provide much help
##The problems started when I found the enclosed quick-start guide (and manual) to be unclear and conflicting
##I called customer support to clarify
##I was informed that the instructions were WRONG and they would be glad to help me setup the DIR-655 and integrate my 6 laptops into the network
##They insisted a manual setup was the best and only way in which they would help (I now wish I knew how automated setup would work)
##Setup of the router and wired connection went relatively well
##For wireless we started with one of the WinXP machines and they recommended WEP encryption due to "issues" with WPA2 on WinXP
security[@]##Also, the previous router used WEP wireless security
software[@]##The first tech was unable to get the WinXP system to connect to the wireless network and turfed the issue to Dell stating that they did not support Dell software
##I contacted Dell Pro support and even though they normally do not support network setup issues, the tech discovered the problem
##The Win7 machine required an internal router code and the WinXP system needs a WEP encryption key
##Unfortunately, my problems were not over as the next WinXP system would not accept the WEP encryption key
##Another call to D-Link support got a tech that new networking better than the first
##It turned out that the Device Ownership Password (transmitted to Win7) was required on this system, but it needed to be obtained from the bottom of the router
software[@]##Still, this wireless adapter software had no provisions for WEP (only WPA2), so the agent attempted to get Windows to manage the card, with no success
##I was again turfed to Dell
security[@][u]##I finally went back to D-Link support and had them help set up WPA  (this agent actually provided decent support, but still could not get one XP system to connect, nor could he help me with a Netgear switch)
##That allowed the Win7 system and the second XP system to connect, but not the first
##Back to Dell support to reload wireless card drivers in the first XP laptop
software[@]##First, he deleted the Dell software managing the card
##and the card connected! Windows is managing the card
security[@][u]##I finally fought through the Win2000 system and it's Netgear PCMCIA card and it was fine with WPA 
##Dell support helped me connect my printer to the network, and I am up and running
##So far, no apparent improvement in wireless network speed, but wired Gigabit is nice
##I do believe there is improvement in reliability on the internet, but that's a tough call
##Because of lackluster customer support, I do not expect to get everything this router should be able to offer
speed[@]##I need to get an N-capable laptop to determine if speed or range is improved
##I have decided to keep the router only because so many hard-fought issues were overcome and I am much more knowledgeable about networks now
##I do NOT recommend this router to an inexperienced person with a mixed network of systems primarily because of D-Link Phillipine-based support and poor documentation!
[t] not happy with the unit
##I had the D-Link DIR-615 and once installed DIR-655 didn't noticed any difference
##Speed did not increase neither did the range of the wireless reception
[t] very satisfied
##Bought this product for my new Sony Vaio
##I had a tech set up the thing since I am a cluts at these things, but I had a little trouble maintaining the signal
##I called the D-Link service line, and contrary to what I have read here, the person at the other end actually seemed to know what she was doing
##She didn't resolve the problem, but the direction she went in enabled me to solve the problem by myself
##I have several wi-fi devices, and they all hook up to the router easily
##I am very satisfied
[t] Works! Now I'm streaming through the Wii!
internet[@]##I used to have a Linkys router and thought my internet service was bad because my wifi would work for a few days and then drop
speed[@]##I got this router and have had zero drops and the speed is fantastic
##I have all of my computers and devices hooked up to it and I stream Netflix through my Wii all day with no issues
##Very happy!
[t] wireless router review
##Not much of a technical guy so I got a lot of information from the customer reviews at Amazon
##The reviews rated this router highly and set up easy
##I have to say the set up went great, the enclosed cd walks though the set up right up to protecting your wireless site
##The router works faster and better than the one I replaced
##I am totally pleased
[t] Avoid D-Link - Designed to fail after warranty expires
##This is my second D-Link Router
##We bought the D-Link GamerLounge Xtreme N Gaming Router DGL-4500 - Wireless router + 4-port switch - Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 802
##11b, 802
##11a, 802
##11g, 802
##11n (draft 2
##0) - external first, it died about 2 months after the warranty ended
##Hung onto it because it hurt to toss it
##At this point, you can plug things in, and the connection is up and down every few minutes
##Replaced it with theD-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router
##Started having problems with it a month or two ago
##Basically, we get disconnects fairly frequently, especially in WoW - or we lose Internet all together - and only power-cycling the router will restore service, however temporarily
##Checked our warranty, and it ended back in August
##We also have theD-Link DAP-1522 Xtreme 4-Port GigaBit Selectable Dual Band Draft 802
##11n N Duo Wireless Bridge/Access Point
##It's limited in the number of ports, and thanks to the lack of external antennas, its range is terrible
##Avoid D-Link, it's garbage, and overpriced garbage at that
[t] The best router I ever used!!!
##I can say this very surely now after using this product for 1month
speed[@]##The range and speed is just awesome
##Few times I had break in signal but it just came up right away
##I see many movies online and it is just cool
streaming[@]##I also saw very good performance with HD online streaming
##Just one big happy customer!!!Neil
[t] Great router
security[@][u]##Easy to setup  features
##Simple as plug in and go
##On DSL and everything seems to be even a little faster thru this router
[t] Outstanding throughput with no drops or reboots needed
##First off, I have the current shipping version consisting of Hardware Version B1 and Firmware 2
##00
##From day one this thing has ran like a champ providing a constant 130Mbps connection to my laptop
##The unit itself runs super cool and isn't even warm to the touch (I imagine this is due to the new hardware version)
port[@]##My only complaint is the USB port doesn't work to allow me to connect to my Buffalo USB hard drive
##I can see the drive but cannot access it
##Hopefully a new version of the Shareport from DLink will correct this
##I can honestly say I am glad I didn't wasted any more time with Netgear or Linksys who seem not to be able to make a decent residential router
[t] Router has only marginally better range
##It is a good router and works well
##I had a new Netgear router that was the new dual band and the range was poor
##Just about 40' away in another room and I only had half signal
##I switched to this one and get better signal but it still does not reach much beyond my building
internet[@]##My house is only 150' from my business so I would like to be able to use just one internet plan
[t] Great Wireless Router
##This router is the best I have used to date
##There may be others that perform as well
##However, if speed, reliability, and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements, then this router will do the job
[t] Do Not Buy This Product
##I purchased this D-Link DIR-655 router to replace a failing Netgear unit that was about 4 years old
##I purchased it after reading rave reviews in several technical publications, including Maximum PC Magazine
##I have spent numerous hours of my time, and the time of my more tech-savvy friends, trying to get it to work - at all
##The symptom I experience is that I can see the router, and get into it's setup, etc
internet[@]##, but I cannot see or get any access at all to the internet
##I have had tech support on a call for over 1 hour from D-Link, who claim the problem is with my ISP
##I have had my ISP tech staff on a call twice, for over an hour who cannot really help because a) it's not a router I am renting from them (though they supply d-Link themselves, but not this model), and b) since there is no connectivity at all, they cannot remote-link in and see what is going on
##They claim it's some conflict between the router and something else running on my system - but not their problem since I can connect directly without any router - which does make some sense
##I have downloaded the firmware and upgraded it; actually replaced it since my device shipped with the most current version supposedly already loaded
##All to no avail
##At this point, I have worked so long on this that I can no longer return it to Amazon
##As part of this experience, I have also looked at a LOT of blogs and have found that my experience is NOT unique with this device
##Many who are clearly more technical than I am have been unable to get thgis device to work, or work reliably
##The concensus is "buy something else"
##In that regard, the only recommendation seems to be "buy Cisco" - which works fine for those wbale/willing to pay $1K+ for a router - I cannot
##I am going back to Netgear, though, again, the Blogs are not very comforting in terms of the the "N Gigabit" model from them either
##Amazon should NOT sell this device till D-Link gets their act together with the product, and their technical support of the product
[t] Tech Support didnt Make the Cut !!!!!
##the product was great but the WiFi would not connect tech support was a total waste they just told me to send it back which I did
##the death of home technology products is tech support this is the biggest issue technology faces today there has to be a better way
##dont buy this prodcut and maybe the company will make an effort to provide good support so little problems like this dont become huge ones
##I will never use d-link again,that is the moral of this story
[t] You are rare to read a 3 star review.
##You are a rare bird for taking a peek at a three star review
##IMHO this is my favorite router from a company with crappy tech support and I'm shopping for something better today
##The good
[t] Warranty not honored- buyer beware.
##I have one of these routers, and it has worked very well for over a year
##Based on my experience, I suggested that my not-so-technically-minded father in-law get one so he could create a wireless network in his house
##He used an Amazon gift card from my wife and I to buy one
##I wasn't surprised to find that he couldn't get it to work, because at 82 he's not about to pick up new computer networking skills, so when we went to visit him a few months later, I made a point to get his router up and running
##It turned out that he hooked it up correctly, and it worked fine as a wired router, but the unit did not transmit a signal
##After searching a few forums, it was clear that this was a problem with some DIR-655 units, and the only course of action was to return it for a replacement
##Amazon never responded to his inquiries for a replacement, which I can understand because of the time lapse, but when my father in-law contacted D-Link, they told him the unit was only warrantied for 2 or 3 months, and he was out of luck
##The fact is that this product has a 1 year warranty, and by this time he had it only 5 months
##At his age I guess he was not willing to press the issue, so instead he bought a different brand at the local store, which he installed and works just fine
##So much for D-Link
##As a result, I won't be replacing my router with another D-Link because of how they treated my wife's dad, and I thought I'd give everyone a heads up on how they operate
##Buyer beware
[t] BEST HIGH-TECH WI-FI ROUTER FOR YOUR MONEY
##OK Folks,first-off, let me say that I have never owned a wi-fi router before
##And recently I purchased my wifey-poo a top-o-dee-line laptop - so a wi-fi router was gonna be added to our computer gadgets
##Being the computer geek that I am, I went to a few different "techie places" to see what was the hottest think out on the market in regards to wi-fi routers
##And "Lo and Behold
##this one kept on popping up
##During this searching process, I learned that the "N" series of wi-fi routers are the newest craze in technology
##(Beating out the "B" and "G" series routers in power/distance, download speeds, and technology)
##Anyhoo, to make a long story short, we purchased the router and could not be happier
##I have it set-up in my office, which is where the main PC is located
##The office also happens to be situated right in between the bedrooms and the living-room and kitchen areas
##It has perfect reception everywhere in our house
##Everywhere we go, the signal strength is "maxed out"
##Now let me be quite frank here
##I also have a high end Cisco firewall router
##And because of that, and never having owned a wi-fi router before
installation[@][u]##the  kinda through me for a loop
##I think it took me a little longer than normal to hook it up, and it's working fine
security[@]##But when I have a little free time, I will need to recheck everything to make sure it is set-up correctly - with all the passwords and security defenses in place
##Like I said before
##so far I am very happy with it
##Pricewise, Amazon
##com has it the cheapest
##And Amazon
price[@]##com is also a reputable seller, so I'd go with them if you want to mail order it at a great price
##Ourselves
##we found it on sale at Circuit City $99
##00
##It was a few dollars more, but we had it in our hands immediately
##Bottom line, I would recommend this router
speed[@]##In it's specs, it beats every other router out in the market for speed of download, power, and distance
[t] Confusing
##I was going to upgrade my Linksys 54G to D-Link N, but to confusing
##If you have a Windows OS, Iguess it would be easier, but I have a Mac system
##I got one computer to work, but my other wirelessdevices, couldn't connect
##A little confusing
##So, I went back to my slow, but faithful Linksys
##MaybeI'll buy a new Linksys N router
##I brought a new Links wireless WRT160N from Walmart; sorry Amazon, router and have been trying to get it to work for the last 2 days; but it wouldn't connect, whatever I did
##Finally, out of desperation, I switched over to Firefox and EVERYTHING started working!!!! My probelm all along had not been the new router or Network preferences, but SAFARI!!! It was screwing things up
##I would recommend that if you are upgrading to a new 'N' router, stay away from Safari and use Firefox, to access your 192
##168
##1
##1 Linksys page
##Webpages load super fast and everything is allot smoother
##I'm switching over to Firefox
##I don't know what it is about Safari, but Linksys wireless router, definitely do not like it
##I can't really say if the D-Link router was any good or bad; since I never really got a chance to test it, priorto sending it back
##All along it was Safari browser screwing things up
[t] Connection keeps dropping on me
##When this router's working it's great, but that's only half the time for me
##I purchased this router over six months ago, and ever since I've had many problems with the connection dropping on several laptops in the house
##I've updated the firmware, replaced the router with a newer one, and called tech support several times
##They admitted a problem with some routers routinely dropping connections, and said for some there's no fix at this point
##They said a future firmward upgrade could fix the problem, but couldn't guarantee it
##Until I can get more consistent coverage, I can only give this router 1 star
[t] Complete garbage, and expensive to boot!
##Had this router for a while and it's been a constant headache
internet[@]##It randomly drops the internet connection and then reconnects
##Not a big deal if you're just checking your email, but if you're trying to upload/download anything, forget it! At first I was led to believe it was due to too many simultaneous connections overloading it (though I never quite believed that) Now I can't do anything with a file over about 2mb even when it's the only thing running and no other devices are connected to the network
##Trying to upload files for a website or stream files is useless since it's constantly crapping out
##I've ended up skipping the router altogether when I want to get any real work done
##Fortunately my modem is in the same room as my computer so I can just plug it straight in
##Worst $150 I've ever spent on a computer product
[t] Poor customer service
##Very poor customer service, my correspondent was essentially impossible to understand
##I wanted to configure this item as a wireless-n access point, but they were unable even to grasp my question
##I eventually succeeded by myself
[t] Better than Netgear WPN824 and ZyXel X-550
##I was looking for a router to replace my Netgear WPN824
##I wanted a device that offered some advanced features such as QoS, Wake-On-LAN/WAN and detailed logging
##I intially tried the ZyXel X-550 and was pleased intially but hated the fact that the coverage was not as good as my Netgear WPN824 and seem to drop connections often
##I recently purchased the DLink DIR-655 and must say I am very impressed
##It offers all the features I was looking for and more
##I initially had an issue with losing connection on the LAN attached (Wired)devices but after doing some troubleshooting I found the issue to be caused by the "Automatic Classification
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Wireless Router Better than Belkin N+ Router
##Tried the Belkin N+ based on the recent Cnet Editor's Choice recommendation
##After 3 calls to Belkin Tech Support to try to resolve dropped connections, I returned the unit and purchased the D-Link DIR-655 Wireless Router
##Since I have AT&T DSL, I needed to call D-Link Tech Support, as the CD installer is not compatible with DSL
##A quick 15 minute call with D-Link resolved the issue
##My unit has been trouble-free ever since! Unit would have earned a 5-star rating if the CD was compatible with DSL
[t] Great speed and coverage
speed[@]##Great speed and coverage
##Easy to set up, the set up CD actually makes it easier if you follow it, the written instructions are harder
##Very satisfied!
[t] Much better than my old router - Bad firmware bug lowers rating
##This router goes further than my old b/g router
##The setup pages are much faster than my old router also, and have a lot more settings
##It's working perfectly, doesn't get too hot (one review mentioned a heat problem)
##I'd recommend this router
##Update
[t] Great product!!!
##I cannot tell the difference from when I had my computer wired to going over to wireless with this router
##Absolutely fantastic
[t] Better than Linksys...
price[@]##Well worth the price
##The setup is easy, but allows you to enable more advanced security, if needed
##I replaced my old Linksys router with this one
##I would have to reboot my cable modem at least once a month in order to regain connectivity
##I have had this for over 8 weeks and have not had to reboot my cable modem once
##Good stuff
[t] Super fast, great product!
##This is a blessing for out smaller house
##I can go anywhere in the house and it is superfast! Easy to set up, the set up CD actually makes it harder if you follow it, the written instructions are easier, great product!
[t] almost perfect
##Everything is fine
##The signal strength is very good, the coverage is very wide, the feature is nice to have
##The problem is only one, that is they do not have feature that allow me to set up the mac filter only for cable connection and or only for wireless connection
##For example if I want to set up my wireless network to be more secure by filtering the mac address and allow any connection from the cable connection, it will not work
[t] WORKS FINE
##Advertised as D-link extreme over 300 mbs
##It works fine but performance is no better than my old SMC G 54mbs
[t] D-Link Wireless Router
##The set up of this router was fairly easy and it seems to work well
##The set-up CD included a program from CISCO that helps you set-up your network and manage it on an ongoing basis
##There is an additional cost for this program (around $50
##00) which I ultimately purchased
##It's not bad and is very useful for the novice but you do not need it
##Overall I would recommend this router
[t] This Router Is A Range Beast!!
##Here's the deal I have my xbox on the first floor but the cable modem and my netgear WNR834B wireless router are upstairs in the office
##The netgear was fine upstairs albeit it was still slow downloading
##Downstairs the signal was spotty at best
##Based on the amazon reviews I picked up the dlink and I was impressed the first time I was trying to pair the xbox with the dlink router
##I got 4 bars where before I only had 1 before
streaming[@][u]##Netflix  was so much faster
##Hands down great router if you need signal coverage throughout your house
##I wont even get into the settings and features as this router pretty much has every setting you could imagine
##Highly recommend the dlink
[t] A Turkey can set this up !!!
##*Ease of setup 5 out of 5 stars*Reliability 5 out of 5 stars*Speed 5 out of 5 stars*Range*Over Heating= NONEI recommend this router to anyone
##This is a very powerful router!!!
[t] D Link Wireless Router
##The unit died after only 2 weeks of use, but replacement was shipped immediately
##New one is working fine
[t] Nice router
##I don't know if the conflicts with Network Magic were due to mixed OS- (VISTA ) but it just didn't work
##Buy the router, skip Network Magic
##I moved up to this router from an older D-Link router- and added a new desktop computer with Windows VISTA at the same time
software[@]##Router set up and links to four other computers was made more complex by the D-Link supplied Network Magic software
##Until I removed the old part I had all kinds of connection problems, printing problems and the like
##With Network Magic gone, I am very happy with the D-Link router
[t] It's ok, not enough stability to rely upon.
##There are some upsides and down sides to this wireless router
##The upsides are
[t] Good Router
##Excellent router and stable, some heat here and there but consistent
##Did have some trouble at the beginning with factory installed 1
##32NA firmware which made router restart once everyday but I knew this router had potential with correct firmware patch since I had used the lower D-Link model DIR-625 which was bulletproof but I needed a 1000BASE-T Gigabit upgrade
##After 1
##34NA was released and installed, it has been running flawless
price[@],installation[@][u]##This router does not support the  of third party firmware like DD-WRT or Tomato because of its closed source code and cpu restricted access, but other than that it runs perfect and have been for 6 months and worth the price
##Edit
[t] Terrible. Just didn't work.
##I bought this as a replacement for 2 Netgear WNR1000 routers that both failed after a few weeks of service
##With the DIR-655 my laptop could not obtain a connection
##It kept cycling between the "Automatic" and "Acquiring Network Address" modes in the Wireless Network Connection dialog
internet[@]##I hooked up my old $30 Belkin (which I keep around as a backup) and was connected to the internet again in less than a minute
##In 2010 there's no excuse for a wireless router that doesn't just work
[t] Solid value
##It is really tough to find a router that everyone likes - there are no five star routers
price[@]##This one seemed most favorable and the product seemed a good mix of product performance and attractive price
##First, the router works great
##I have 100% connectivity, even sitting in my backyard
##There is no issue with drop-outs or rebooting, which some other folks have complained about
speed[@]##Connection speed is generally @ 50 mps, which works just fine for web surfing, email, etc
##Second, do not count on D-Link support to get you setup
##I had a problem with my laptop configuration (it was used by my daughter at college, so is 4 years old)
##I could not establish a WPA connection
##Not willing to settle for WEP, I called D-Link
##Twice
##And had extended conversations with their service reps
##The first provided bad advice
##The second asked to call me back after 20 minutes
##When I asked why, I was informed that the average service call is 15 minutes, so when the conversation becomes too lengthy, they cut off the call to keep a ceiling on the statistics
security[@]##Good grief!Anyway, the problem was with the security key
##The D-Link reps were having me enter the WEP key, which is 10 digits
##I did some reading and had the router generate a random 32 bit key, and then manually entered that into the laptop wireless setup
##That fixed the problem and I was rolling with WPA
[t] I love it!
##Since I moved a few months ago my wireless connection just wouldn't stay up with my old Netgear router
##My wireless connection would drop repeatedly throughout the day
##When I bought a new laptop running Windows 7 the problem got even worse
##I had to connect and disconnect repeatedly to get a connection
##I decided the problem was interference from other wireless networks in my area
##There are 11 other wireless secured networks in my range
##After reading a lot of reviews online I settled on the D-Link DIR-655 and all I can say is, "I love this router!"
##Since I set it up 5 days ago I haven't lost my connection once! The setup was extremely easy
##Much more so than the netgear was
##My signal stays strong no matter where I am in the house
internet[@]##My internet browsing seems faster and my download speeds have increased by as much as 100 kbps in most cases
##Although I haven't used it much so far, I also like the Shareport feature
port[@]##I plugged in a powered USB port with 7 slots and can access all my removable drives fine
##Operations such as extracting or moving large archives isn't fast over the Shareport with that multiple drives running through it, but it's still fast enough for me to stream a movie from the Shareport to my laptop!I am extremely happy with this router and highly recommend it even for the novice user
[t] Great router
##It's easy for me to setup
##I'm an IT guy
[t] Very good
##My friend recommended it to me
##I like it
##Easy to set up, especially to me, I am not good at it
[t] Router is worthless
port[@]##This router seems to work out of the box, but as soon as itis properly configured(with security, port forwarding, QOS, etc) itdrops any connections
##Set it back to defaults and it startsrouting correctly
##Right now, I'll just have to run an open networkand hope no one bothers to steal my wifi until I can find anotherrouter that actually works
[t] Customer Support/Service? Product Not Mac friendly.
##Bought Dir-655
##Own Mac 10
##4x G4
##Disk that shipped with product did not work in Mac
##Went to Dlink/support web site to download firmware/software/install wizard
##Mac not supported
##Web support, FAQ's ect
##are no help concerning Mac install
##Called customer service (877-453-5465)
##Phone system does not respond to any input
##Have not been able to talk to live human voice
##Update
[t] D-LINK D-STINK
##I had an expert install this unit replacing a well known router
##We tried it out sitting just 5 feet away to see if it would work, all I got was a FAIR reception, worse than what I had
##HORRIBLE
[t] Computer Router
##My computer expert friend suggested I purchase this product
installation[@]##Fortunately, he was also available for installation as the instructions with the unit were not valid for my Comcast Internet System
[t] Great Router!!!!!
##I have no complaints about this router
##I've been using it about a month now and I'm really impressed with the stable connectivity
##My Blu-Ray, laptops, and cell phone are all connected with great signal strength
##Absolutely a great buy!!!!! 5 star product
[t] Don't buy it - it will make you cry
##After one year of owning this router, it has gone from OK to finicky to unusable
##I now get a spontaneous DHCP release several times a day
##I have updated the firmware, turned off any options possible, read all the forum posts and made sure the thing is not overheating
##I originally bought it because it supported an external antenna and the reviews were generally decent, but I am about to buy another router just to preserve my sanity
##Fly, you fools
##Save yourselves
[t] Great Stuff
##This is a very good router
##Easy set up, even for use with a MAC
##I have told several friends about this Router
[t] Bit of a wait in getting
##Bit of wait to receive it but when it arrived everything went fine
##Excellect CD set up and installation, very easy
##Works great
[t] Definitely Brand New!!!
##Does not disappoint
##Product arrived quick, it really is next day
##Very good signal around the house
##I used this as a wireless access point and its wireless signal is so much better than the 2wire that att provided
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router
##Haven't had this unit for long, but it was easy to install and easy to configure
##I primarily bought it for the SecureSpot filtering, which seems to work just fine
##Had a zyxel and used their parental controls, but, at $70 per year, it seemed a bit too much for a bit too little
[t] alright product
##I expected to be surprised with this product, but I turned out not
##Its performances are the same as my previous modem
[t] junk
##I bought this based upon several reviews that I read
##Don't believe anything positive
speed[@][u]##This device functioned @ 1/4 of the  of my previous WAP
##Old was 54Mbps this was running @ 11mbps, wirelessy & wired
##The web based interface has more adjustments that a Cisco router
##Don't waste your money with it
##I'm returning it & anxiously await my refund
[t] 5 Star hardware
##The device performance ranks 5 stars
##The 99 page owners manual on the accompaning CD remains for others to read and rate, I chose not to read it
[t] Definitely not pleased with item
##I was very disappointed with this product
##I had a hard time getting to work
##When I called support, no real attempt was made to help me
##Finally, I returned the product and purchased a Belkin N1 Vision Wireless Router
##I am glad I made that decision
##Bob
[t] Not any faster than wireless G...yet
##I must say that the product worked right out of the box, once properly set up
##The speeds howevewr are not any better than wirelss G
##I have a DSL set up with a new notebook rated for high speeds
##My measured land line connection is at about 86M
##The best I can get on my notebook is 54M
##I spoke to both Verizon and DLink customer service, and did all of their checks, and programming
##Still no faster
##Thust the 3 star rating
##If speeds were as reported, would be a 5
[t] "Xtreme" stands for XTREME FRUSTRATION if you are a Apple/Mac user
##Although this router says it is Macintosh compatible, don't expect any help from D-Link's User Manual nor website for set up on a Mac
##The only thing on their website regarding the Mac is the OS it needs to be higher than, and to see pages 10-14 of the 93 page user manual
##Page 10 basically says to skip to page 14 if you are not using the (Windows Only) CD for set up, and when you get to page 14 it tells you what to type in the window that the CD brought up, which you can't see
##What a waste of time, money and accumulated frustration! I suggest they quit saying Macintosh Compatible until they give some instructions for Mac users
##Come on D-Link
##put a few instructions somewhere for Mac users! In my book, you rate your name 'D'-link, far from getting an 'A'-link
##You can make a CD and a 93 page manual for PC users, but not any instructions at all for Mac users? Shame on you!
[t] Same range as Belkin 802.11g
##I purchased this router to increase the range compared to my 4 year old Belkin g router
##After setting it up and talking to tech support for 2 hours, I still get the exact same signal (very low) as I did with the old g-class router
##I am using an Asus netbook with an n wireless adaptor, but the DIR 655 performs exactly the same as an old g router from about 40 feet away
##6x? 14X? "extreme-n"?
##The exact same performance as a g-class router, the only difference is that the DIR 655 is more expensive
[t] Don't buy D link xtreme if you have a mac
##Bought a d link
software[@]##Cd does not provide guidance for support for mac or software to install for mac
##Technical support rude and unhelpful
[t] Defective had to return it
##I wish I hadn't bought this router
##I spent eight hours trying to get it to work but couldn't
##The *tech* support at d-link was exceptionally bad (as is noted by many other reviewers)
##In the end they told me I had correctly configured it and it must be defective
##Follow up (two days later)
##I spent another couple of hours trying to get it to work and I glad I did it because a replacement wouldn't have helped
##It turns out that the problem lies in the router firmware v
##1
##21
##It turns out that in some instances You *must* use the router's virtual server to forward ports
port[@][u]##The firmware supports direct  forwarding, but direct doesn't work under some scenarios
##The only default setting I changed was the router IP (changed from 192
##168
##0
##1 to 192
##168
##1
##1) and I also reserved two IPs
##I'm still leaving my rating as a 1
##The router is working, but this issue seems to indicate that the firmware wasn't thoroughly regression tested (checked under a wide variety of settings)
[t] Popular Gigabit Router with Flaws
##This is one of the most popular wireless routers which comes with impressive features
##1 GB LAN ports, 801
##11n Wireless, USB2
port[@]##0 port just to name a few
##The main reason i bought this router is to improve my home network to 1GB standard and in particular to include a fast external USB hard drive into the network
##(The old setup required to have the HD connected to a PC which means the PC would need to be always on simply to access the hard drive
##So i thought the D-Link router could also function as a "pseudo" NAS with fast access to the hard drive from the network)Sadly, in practice the router showed some flaws, some of them significant
##1) The DLINK 655 router (when used as my new main router behind a DSL modem) kept rebooting as it seems, constantly bringing the whole network/internet down
##I dont know whether this is a router problem or related to firmware
##I updated the DLINK to the latest EU firmware 1
##34
##but as said the behavior of the router was ANYTHING but reliable
##In the past, i had many other routers from Linksys, Fritzbox, even cheap non-name routers, but NONE of those showed random reboots and similar behavior
##The vast set of features is worthless if the router is not reliable
##2) The USB feature and my dream of incorporating of my external HD into the net via the DLINK USB2
port[@]##0 port has shown not practical - not to say i consider their solution nonsense
software[@]##The problem is that for connected USB devices on the router each PC needs a special software called "Shareport" to access the device - and it is ONLY possible that one PC at a time can access the USB
##If another PC wants to access the USB device, ie
##hard drive, the other PC first has to release the device
##In other words
[t] Unbelievably Fast!
##I like to start off by saying, this product is AWESOME! I had basic service for 12mbps, I was not getting anywhere near 12mbps
speed[@]##Had a lot of lag in my connection and my speedtest speed was always around 5mbps
##I switched my modem first to a motorola sb6120, it helped a lot but it only helped at the source of the connection
##I am on my laptop most of the time on a different floor so I needed a solution
speed[@]##The modem was processing a fast speed but it would sync well with older wireless routers that are running on 150N/N150 technology
##I look around and I seen a lot of people write positive reviews about this product so I gave it a shot
##After I received it, I set it up right away
##At first I did not see any major changes anywhere, the connection on the other floor was still low
##So I called tech support and they walked me through the router setup, got a firmware update, setup the firewall
##And after a reboot, my connection went from 5-12mbps to 25mbps! And this is on a wireless connection!!!!! Unbelievable! I am amazed! The only con is that every once in a while I have to do a manual reset of my modem and router to get it work again
##But other than that 95% of the time I am getting faster speeds than I am paying for
##This item is highly recommended, works good with other Docsis 3
##0 modems particularly the motorola sb6120
[t] Great Reception
##Love this product
##It is solid, doesn't need restarts every week
##Wifi range is great, covers the whole 2-story house from the basement
[t] Not exactly what I expected.
security[@]##The is good overall, the security is great, and the options are more than plenty
##The only bad thing is, my connection is almost non-existent when using 1
##1MB bandwidth to download
##My previous router works tons better in that aspect
[t] Four years strong!
##i was checking out new products and came across the 655 that i bought four years ago and had to write a review
##if you're considering this model, it has worked nearly flawlessly connecting 3 laptops, a wireless printer, a cabled NAS, and two cabled desktops (the only exception is when i need to reboot it maybe 2 or 3 times a year -- it's really rare to do that)
##not strong enough for multilevel homes with coverage in all its corners but few routers are
##within its normal range it's nothing but fast and excellent and accepts firmware updates with no problems
##a really super product
[t] Extremely Pleased - Easy Setup
##This router was super easy to set up for this "Networking and WiFi Challenged" person
##So simple
security[@]##I was online in a matter of minutes with security features
[t] Router is not very good
##I'm surprised at all the good reviews on this router
##Unfortunetely I bought it because of the good reviews, but it's going back to Fry's next week
speed[@]##My 8 year old Netgear FVM318 router's wireless speed is 100 to 200% faster then the DIR-655 router, and the latency is consistenly 33% better! The wifi reception on the DIR-655 is only slightly better, but, the wifi connectivity drops from time to time, which never happened with my Netgear router
##I'm really wondering why this router has all these great reviews, because I don't recommend it
##I'm going to try another Netgear router
[t] Works as expected - So far so good
##Was a good buy for the money
##Works fine
port[@]##Comes with a USB port on the back for connecting typical USB devices direct to the router so that you can share printers without having to set up a home network and all that
##Running Win XP and Win 7
[t] Locks up from time to time
price[@][u]##This product has a decent  and a good feature set
##Most everything else is pretty much average
##The main problem is that it locks up under heavy use
##If I just use it for light web browsing and occasional network file transfer, it's okay
##But if I try to download a huge service pack, use it for torrents, or watch a lot of Netflix streaming, it locks up completely
##When it's locked up, networked computers cannot access each other and nothing can access the Internet
##About 3-4 times a week I have to power cycle the router in order to fix this problem
speed[@]##All the neat features and speed don't matter if the thing is locked up
##I have owned this unit for years now and none of the firmware updates have solved the problem
##I finally gave up and got a different router
[t] No problems!
##Everything went as it should - no issues
speed[@]##The speed is good, but nowhere near 300Mbps - maybe the cable signal is limiting my speed though
##I am getting 3x faster connection speeds (verified thru speedtest
##net)
##Very happy with this product
[t] Not great for gaming or HD streaming
##I've owned a number of routers in my time and this one, like them all, has pros and cons
##Lets start with the pros
[t] Good when it works
##It is a very nice router when it wants to work
##I have been on the phone with D-Link 4 times trying to find out why the router randomly stops working, but they just keep messing with the settings insisting it is not the router
internet[@]##I have had the cable company out 3 times and they guarantee me that it is not the internet
internet[@]##I have upgraded the firmware, portforwarded and done everything i could possibly do, but every other day i have to come home and pull the power plug to the router, wait for it to reboot then get on the internet
##After working all day and spending 80 bucks on a router, I really do not think I should have to do this
##I would go with something else if you are looking to spend the money
##I had a netgear before and it never had this many problems
[t] worthless product
##I bought this router to extend the range of the wireless network within my house
##It was a failure
##The range was no greater than that of my old router
##In addition, it frequently dropped the wireless connection while the wired connection remained good
##The wireless connection could only be restored by rebooting the router
##I sent it back and obtained another identical router
##It had identical problems
##Possibly Amazon had a defective batch of these routers
##They were highly recommended by the person who set up my network
[t] Range & Signal Strenth are Just Awful..... avoid this product
##I bought this here at Amazon largely on the strength of the other reviews here, and wish I hadn't
##I don't know whether I just got a bad one, but the wireless range and signal strength are terrible
##I should have sent it back during the Amazon return period, but I didn't motivate to do so and now I'll be stuck with replacing it and taking a total loss
##As a concrete example, in the next room a mere 20 feet away with nothing in between other than a little drywall, I only get 2 signal bars on my Kindle
##And two bars on a mac laptop
##And downstairs, within 40-50 feet, it barely registers at all
##one bar IF the computers can see it
##There are four routers in my neighbors' surrounding houses which are penetrating my house with a stronger signal than this router IN the house
##I'm sure it probably has a bunch of advanced features I'm not using, but it's not doing the basic job it was bought for
##It doesn't supply a decent wireless signal within a regular house, even at short ranges
##The words "extreme" and "gigabit" sound fast, but this thing makes for a SLOW home network
##It will wind up in a drawer and I'm shopping for a replacement
##Poor signal, give this one a pass
[t] Strong signal, stable operation
##I've owned and used this router for over 5 months now and not once have I needed to reset it or been struggling for signal within or around my home
##It's neat, compact and looks good, although I have hidden it from view recently as the LED lighting is unnecessarily bright
##Very happy with the purchase
[t] D-Link Dir-655 Router improved my home network performance!
##Before I installed my new D-Link DIR-655 (and a new Modem) my home network was slow and the wireless reception in parts of the house was spotty
##I installed the new router and a modem and was amazed by the difference in performance of the game, smartphone and laptop that depend on wireless reception
##It was easy to install as well
[t] Needs improvement on installation instructions
installation[@][u]##The  instruction CD/DVD has errors
##D-Link, needs to test the instructions with a focus group so they can find out that it is missing key information
##E
##g
##- It asked me to disconnect broadband modem but never did ask me to re-connect
##I would have saved time and not think that I missed a step
[t] Randomly drops connections!
##This router is horribly unreliable! I replaced it with a Linksys, which hasn't had any problems
##How does D-Link get away with selling this garbage?
[t] Easy wireless network
##This thing was so easy to install
##It was almost harder to remove it from the box than to get it up and running on my old Windows Vista desk top
##I just followed the instructions and in just a few minutes I had a great wireless network
##It was even easy to connect my phone, printer, and my laptops
speed[@]##The speed is great and so is the range
##It covers the entire house and then some
##It is also secure
##I would suggest this to anyone looking to set up a home wireless network
[t] D-Link! D-Link! D-Link! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!
##I am very satisfied with this product
##Setup needs to be carefully followed if you have DSL, but otherwise the unit was straightforward to setup and performs extremely well
##I replaced my WRT54g with this unit and WOW 802
##11n has my vote for speed, consistency, and signal strength from the router
##Give it a try, you won't be disappointed
##I paired it up with the DAP-1522 Bridge/Access Point for my home theater system
##Killer combo!Update
[t] Excellent router
speed[@]##This is a great super speed router - for me it does connect over 10 of my WIFI devices - 4 hard wired devices, VOIP calls and yet stream the movies flawlessly
##never had any heating up issue as some one had mentioned in one of the reviews
##Extremely happy with it
[t] It did what it had to do. Linked me to WI Fi
##It connected me to Wi Fi
##Now I can shop and get on the inter net
##and read books
##so far everything is good
[t] Router
##I have gone back to Comcast and they have our telephone too
internet[@]##For the internet I needed a router so I could get on with other users in the family
##It works great and I've had no problems
##I bought this as I read that you don't need one that cost's a lot of money just one that will do what you need it to do
##So far it has worked great
[t] was a good router but started having issues
##it was a good router when i only had 2 laptops and a desktop on the network but when i added two wireless printers, two media devises and my NAS to the mix things got problematic
##In the beginning i couldn't figure out why my Air Play would't show on my Iphone or Ipad and why i couldn't air print from either device to my wireless printers (this was also an issue on our Macbooks and Lenovo)
##So i checked everything to make sure things were up to date and played with the settings but i still couldn't get the printers and airplay to stay constant so i finally had to give up and i replaced the router with a different brand with dual band capability
##i gave it 3 stars cause its really not a bad router and it gives pretty good signal strengths but it doesn't handle traffic very well so if you have alot on your network i wouldnt recommend this
[t] D-Link DIR-655 Router stops working!!!! JUNK!
##I have owned the D-Link DIR-655 Router for a few years now
##I work on VPN from home, so I am on the wireless router constantly
##I have many wi-fi devices (Android phones, iPhones, iPods, Kindles, laptops, NAS, etc)
##I recently upgraded the firmware to 2
##10
##My sons got Windows 8 machines recently
##For unknown reasons I am experiencing constant drops of wireless signals from this DIR-655 router
##I've changed the channels (1, 6, 11, auto search), removed encryption, experimented with different settings, removed the upgraded firmware back to 2
##07, but still get the constant drops of wi-fi
##The router will simply stop broadcasting wi-fi for no reason and most devices connected, will be disconnected immediately with no warning
##This is very frustrating
##More frustrating is the fact D-Link is of no help unless you pay them a substantial fee (warranty ended)
##Their email support is rudimentary and useless
##There is no reason why the wi-fi should stop broadcasting randomly
##Again, this is a recent phenomenom
##A relative of mine also has a D-Link router (different model) and he has the SAME problem of constant drops and his problems are also recent
##He has owned his router for about the same amount of time as me!! This appears to be a D-Link problem to me
##My recommendation would be to NOT purchase this router or any D-Link product
##It does not last for more than a few years and is frustrating to use when wi-fi stops broadcasting for NO REASON
##I need wireless in my home (it is where I work) and there are likely many better choices in routers on the market
##D-Link is junk
##DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ROUTER!!!!
[t] Steady and promising wireless, update##I decided to buy new one, so many choices in the market, I tried Belkin N750 dual band that doesn't good enough for streaming video and range also
##Next try was Dlink N300+(internal antenna), Dlink is good guidance when you hooked up into computer
##but range is still not my favorite
##DIR-655 was recommended from my coworker and I bought this it was set-up as vertical standing to get better heat dissipation and better range too
internet[@]##Disabled IPv6 on my computer due to internet speed, If you want to try, goto your property of local network controller and click configure and then advance tap where you could change enable or disable
##Find and disabled them
[t] excellent.
internet[@][u]##We are five people in our home, more than 11 wifi device and all of them getting  uninterruptedly
##Range is more than enough for a medium home
##(Almost 250 ft radius)
##And its super easy to install
##One of the best router I have ever had
[t] B1 hardware version works as well as original A2 model except for QOS.
##I originally used the A2 hardware version of this router for several years with excellent performance
##I bought this latest B1 hardware version to replace that as I was experiencing problems with my Internet connection and thought maybe my old router was getting too old to be reliable
##This hardware version uses a different firmware than the older A2 version
##I found the functionality to be similar except for a couple of things
##Most noticeably, it seems this B1 version's firmware doesn't give you as much time as the A2 version to change settings before timing out and requiring you to log into the web interface again
##I found myself having to constantly save every time I change any setting to prevent the web interface from timing out and forgetting everything I changed before saving
speed[@]##Another major difference between this and the A2 version is the inability to set a manual upload speed for QOS higher than 2 Mbps in the B1 version
speed[@]##The A2 version's manual upload speed for QOS can be set as high as 100 Mbps
##I don't understand why D-Link would limit the newer version of this router like that especially when upload speeds being provided by ISP's to the average consumer are going up
##Because of this limitation I have gone back to using my old A2 version and will probably not be using this B1 version router again
speed[@]##I'd rather find some alternative router that supports higher manual upload speed settings for QOS
##The only other thing that I noticed is much different between this B1 version and the old A2 version are the design of the status lights
##On the A2 version there is a small icon of what each status light represents printed directly on the router's body in black above the light which makes it impossible to differentiate between the different status lights from a distance without memorizing what each light represents
##On the B2 version the icons for the status lights on the front have been incorporated into the shape of the light itself and increased in size to make them easier to see from a distance
##So when the status light for the Internet lights up you see the light in the shape of the icon that indicates that the Internet is connected and working
##I just wish that the colors had been changed a little to make it easier to differentiate between the different lights
##They are all still the same bright blue color as the older A2 version
##If you use this router in a dark room the lights are so bright they may distract you or bother you if you try to sleep in the same room while the router is on
##The lights constantly blink even if you are not actively using your Internet connection
##There is no way I know of to turn the lights off or dim them
[t] Decent, but dysfunctional router
##When I first bought this product, it was a pain to install, and then after contacted customer support for assistance
##After describing my problem to the customer service lady, her only advice after 10 minutes was to unplug and replug the device
##Eventually, I figured out how to set up the router, and it performed well
##I got good speeds all around my house, which was much better than any router I had owned before
internet[@]##But eventually, the first night that I used the router, my internet went down
##I went to the router setup page to see what was wrong, then i saw that it said that the cable status was "disconnected"
internet[@]##I unplugged and replugged the ethernet cable running from the modem to the router, and my internet was functional once again
internet[@]##Unfortunately, the internet started to disconnect every single day, so i had to redo that process every single day (unplug the modem and router, replug them, turn them both back on, then hope that it was reconnected, but many times i had to do that about 4 times to get it to work)
##Then yesterday, i went downstairs to fix the router because it was down yet again, and no matter what I did, i couldn't get the router to be "connected" again
##So now, I am attempting to make a return to purchase a new router, that 1
##worked constantly 2
##had good range/speed and 3
##had some sort of helpful customer support
##Unfortunately, i have owned the router for over 30 days, and I will need to contact amazon to set up a return
##I would not recommend purchasing from this company, for reasons I have already stated
[t] Another Solid DLink Router
##I had been dying to get this router
##It had went on sale at TigerDirect so I grabbed it!($55)
##This is another solid router from DLink
##I previously owned the DLink DGL-4300 gaming router
##In all of the three years I used it, it never ever dropped the connection
##Simple awesome
##Now on to the DLink 655
##I've had this router for about 3 months now and it is holding up just like the DGL-4300
##It has never dropped the connection, so far and the wireless operation has been flawless
##My wife's computer is upstairs maybe 15ft away (8ft concrete ceiling - basement) gets a solid 150Kbps signal
##She can run video with no lag or dropped frames -- you wouldn't know it was wireless if you didn't see the adapter
##One of the primary reasons I bought this router is because it is IPv6 ready
##Unfortunately, I have not set it up as of this impromptu product review
##I did however have a look at the firmware settings to enable it and I found documentation from Comcast on how to set it up
##I'll try to remember to update this review when I do set it up
##One thing of note
[t] Router for Computer Dummies
##Wow
##everything was so easy to do, the hook up
security[@]##the security
##the ease of operation
##the lights are bright which for me is a good thing since my router and other components are in a dark utility room
##but here is the best part
internet[@],speed[@]##my internet speed has increase
##and no more lost connections
##this unit was recommended by my brother-in-law
##an IT guy
##yuuuup
##you need to get this unit!!!
[t] Good router
##My daughter needed a router, so I got this one based on good reviews, and also got a second one for myself
##I had been using an older Netgear router that worked ok, but needed to be rebooted every few days to get DNS to work properly
##I also wanted to have 1Gb capability on the network in case I wanted to do network backup
price[@]##Amazon had a good price on these D-Link routers and I am pleased to say that they have worked out very well
##Both routers have been in operation for almost a month working flawlessly
##I have not had to reboot the router even once - very reliable operation
##The only negative I might say about it is the user interface
##As a retired computer science instructor who taught Cisco networking, I prefer to view and change the settings directly
##The D-Link DIR-655 seems to prefer that you work through a wizard sort of interface
##Navigating through the different settings is a bit clumsy
##Once you get used to it, it is not bad, but I would have preferred a cleaner display
##Even my old Netgear router did a better job of this
##Overall, I would certainly recommend this router - it works well and is stable
[t] My Dlink
##Easy to set up
##good value for the money
##Try this one, I think you will like it! Recommended to me by a friend at work, he said if you need a good router than purchase this one it really performs well and I haven't had any problems with it
##I haven't had any issues with this extreme d-link either
##Get one, it won't be a mistake
[t] Great for a while
##I've had the unit for six months and the first five were great
streaming[@]##The unit has great range and streaming video to my wireless blu-ray had no problems and overall good performance
##BUT, just recently without any changes to the unit's setup I started getting drops on the wireless side, almost daily
##This is real frustrating as the network just disappears from view and the only way to get is back is with a hard boot of the router
##Hopefully, they will release a firmware fix or something soon, or I guess I've got a worthless unit!
[t] Excellent Router
##Have had this router for months, and I haven't had any issues with it at all
##Setting up the wireless was incredibly easy, and the connection is very fast
##If you have thick walls, the range could be better, but the router works very well, and doesn't get too hot
##I have it connected to my Laptop running Linux Mint 11, my PS3, and my HP printer, with no issues what-so-ever
[t] Great Router
##Wasn't sure if I could install by myself but gave it a try
##Very easy setup
##Great instructions
##Have had now for a few weeks and never a problem
[t] Unable to connect to internet
##After two hours trying to get it to work, I gave up and sent it back
software[@],installation[@][u]##The  process is cumbersome and slow, and the software fell into a loop after I logged in, rebooting the router over and over
##I tried using the wizard and I tried installing manually
##Nothing worked
##Using Windows 7, Comcast cable
[t] Almost got it right!
##Unfortunately D-Link has yet again crippled great hardware with poor firmware
##The link-ablity, reliability, and performance is awesome! However, about every couple days I'll have to restart to get maximum performance out of the router
##After waiting for a couple minutes it's back up and running perfectly
streaming[@][u]##Highly recommended for bandwidth prioritization, gaming, and media 
[t] best router yet
##This is by far the best router I have ever had to date, it has not dropped connection once yet works perfect with Xbox could not be happier!!!!
[t] Love this router!!!!
##I ordered this router not sure what to expect, I am not very "up" on these types of things
##I just knew I had to reboot my old router every other day and even then wireless connection was not so hot
##I have had this router for 3 months now and LOVE it!! I have not had to reboot once, wireless connection is awesome
internet[@],speed[@]##heck even my iphone internet is faster!! the speed of my internet is now actually high speed internet!! Extremely simple set up, would highly recommend this router to anyone!!
[t] Great Router
##Bought this router to eliminate weak signals at far end of the house - replacing a D-Link DI-524
##Set up was easy and we immediately noticed improved reception inside
##Even better was being able to stream TV outside on our laptop - couldn't do that before
##Only down side is the bright blue LED signal indicators but it does may a great night light
[t] Cuts out!
##I noticed I had to reset the router every night
##When it worked, it worked great! But when I install a router, I want to forget it's there
##I returned it and bought a Belkin
##We'll see how that goes
[t] Easy Set-Up & Works Great
##I purchased the D-Link DIR 655 to replace a bad g router
##I get better distance and signal on wi-fi
##The set-up was as easy as it can be
[t] great router
##This is the fourth or fifth router i have owned, and by far the best
##Fast speed, great security, and no issues
[t] Great Wireless Router
installation[@]##This router was very easy to install, I didn't use the included installation cd because I only have a Mac; the manual install was quick and easy
##Performance wise, I have noticed a boost in download and upload speeds compared to my old Linksys wireless G router
##So far, I have not had any dropped connections or resets from the router
##Also, some people had problems with their units producing excessive amounts of heat; I have not encountered this problem and the unit is operating as expected
##Overall, this was a good purchase!***Update***After three months of use, the router still works well and have had no issues with it
[t] Good for streaming movies between computers in the household.
##The product installed as easily as it could be, requring only the most basic of reading capability or prior knowledge
##I've got transfer speeds of 5 Megabytes (60 megabits) from my desktop to a laptop, so the only problem would occur if you're using fibre optic speeds
##Strong signal works throughout the house, 3x faster than my previous router so that's good
[t] Great router
##We needed to update our wireless router for our house and this was a really good deal, it works great!
[t] Still going after 3 years...
##The router hasn't really given me any trouble at all
##I did have one PC that was dropping off the wireless network for a bit, but that was cured when I upgraded the NIC's firmware
##Oh and be sure to upgrade the router's firmware on occasion
##It does seem to help
##I'd definitely buy another router like this one if it were necessary
[t] Super for the price
##Does what a router is supposed to
##Hasn't had too much trouble even with 5+ devices at a time
##Good range
##Neat look
##But I wouldn't go so far as to call it "EXTREME"
##I reserve that word for backflips and couponing
[t] Great product, Excellent performance
##So far I have not had any problems, and even with Wifi, I am able to stream movies from a distance
##I was very skeptical regarding the consistency of the signal
##But I have pretty much the same quality as I use the cable
[t] Great Router
software[@]##I bought this router based on the recommendation of our lead software developer, who is sort of a guru geek (or geek's geek if you like)
##The signal strength of the wireless portion is fantastic
##I really like the set up pages (I've owned a few different routers)
##There's a lot of flexibility (such as being able to leave DHCP running but you can reserve IP addresses for your equipment)
##I highly recommend this router
[t] Very pleased
##Setup was a breeze, all of my devices work, and the connection never drops
##Exactly what you want from a router
[t] Very please with the D-Link DIR-655
##I previously had another D-Link Router and it died after a number of years of good service, so I purchased the new DIR-655
##This is a beautiful wireless router! It's extremely fast, and it hooked itself up without any problems
##I expected I would have to tweak it to death as I have had to do in the past, but it just planted itself and started running
##It even put in the encryption codes
##One of the reviews I read somewhere on this product, said that it ran so hot in terms of the operating temperature of the unit, that they had to return it
##I found that this unit runs considerably cooler than any that I have owned before
##What I did note, is that the router comes covered with a thin mylar film all over it, which blocks the air holes
##If a person did not see this mylar and did not remove it, I would expect this thing would melt down
##I highly recommend this product
[t] DLink Wireless Router DIR-655
##I must say this router puts out a very stable signal
##The signal is powerful enough to penetrate three 6-inch concrete walls at a distance of50ft
internet[@][u]##I get two of five signal bars, and even so it still stable to surf the  at 54mbps - uninterrupted in wireless-G mode
##The router features a massive amount of config options sure to satisfy a guru home techie
##The router also is very compatible with other brands of wireless cards
##I am using the wireless card that came with an HP DV6500 laptop
##And as I mentioned before, the signal simply does not buckle from that distance
##I won't bother to mention the obvious other features, but just to say it is a formidable router
##I was gonna buy the linksys router but wasn't sure if it could work in my situation
##The setup was a bit weird, as the CD crashed my computer
##I did get all up and running in less than 10 minutes in basic mode
##Good stuff !!!
[t] Easy Setup and Great Range
##I purchased this product today at lunch
##I replaced a Netgear Wireless-G router and what a fantastic improvement this was
speed[@]##Great range and speed
##It was very easy to install and set up as well
security[@],software[@]##I had it up and running with all the software installed and security enabled in no more than 10 minutes
##A fantastic product that I would highly recommend
[t] Great router!
##I moved up to this router from an older D-Link router- and added a new desktop computer with Windows VISTA at the same time
software[@]##Router set up and links to four other computers was made more complex by the D-Link supplied Network Magic software
##Until I removed Network Magic I had all kinds of connection problems, printing problems and the like
##With Network Magic gone, I am very happy with the D-Link router
##I don't know if the conflicts with Network Magic were due to mixed OS- (VISTA and XP) but it just didn't work
##Buy the router, skip Network Magic
[t] Three Hours on Support Line! Don't Buy It!
##Support is great, very knowledgable
##But the product is insufficiently thought through
##First, you should know that it sets up a new network, so your Windows 7 "Homegroup" won't work
##No file transfer between your existing network and the new one will work
##But when I set it up, the configuration program thought my network was secure and it wasn't, so it took a support call and some very obscure steps to set it correctly
##Then it turned on that the fact that my existing network dynamically selected its communication channel was a problem
##Another support call
##Fixed, but time consuming
internet[@]##Then whenever I connected with the extender it would drop its internet connection
##Another call
##lots of rearranging of equipment
##No solution
##Support escalated the problem, but I was out of patience
##Three hours of fooling with somthing like this is three hours too much
##I sent it back to Amazon
[t] Frequent disconnects and reboots
##I have worked with networks for about 20 years, and have worked with just about every router brand out there
##I was very optimistic about this product based on other user's reviews, but like MANY users have confirmed, this router can be extremely flaky
##I tested with different firmware versions and various setting adjustments as recommended by other users experiencing the same problems, and it still disconnect and reboot itself at random and frequently
security[@]##It only seem to be marginally stable when degrading or disabling security settings, which is totally unacceptable to me
##Opening certain online games takes way too long, even if you are just playing online and not hosting
##None of those games require opening any ports when not hosting
##Downloading emails with attachments fails about 80% of the time and causes the router to reboot
##I would not recommend this product to anyone
[t] Frequently drops signal
##Purchased this router after reading reviews
##Did very well for first 3 mths but soon after started dropping signals (wireless)
##If you have 4-5 devices connected to it, this drop in signal becomes very evident
##At times, the router is not discoverable and frequently needs to be restarted
##2 stars because when it works, it sends a very strong signal
##However, restarting the router frequently is undesirable
##Drops signal almost once to twice a day now after 8 mths
##Firmware update done but problem still persists
##I want to like this router but the frequent drops make it very frustrating
##Would not buy this again
[t] Great except for the WiFi
##I work in IT and after using this router and also getting it replaced with another we ran into constant problems where the WiFi would drop and the only way to reset it was to power cycle the unit
##I tried multiple different things such as using only N or G signal, disabling QoS and even leaving the encryption off with no luck
##Ended up going with a little more expensive Netgear router and it has been running perfect
[t] Best purchase I've made this year!
##I used to have a Dlink WBR1310
##it was terrible and I almost gave up on Dlink till I came across this router with all of it's glorious reviews
##I have to say, they were absolutely right!PRO
[t] This thing rocks
##I don't normally bother writing reviews of things I purchase, but I made an exception in this case because this is such an exceptional piece of equipment
##It solved all my wireless problems
internet[@]##Streaming video has no hiccups and all internet access is noticeably faster even from antique 811b access points
##I now have a good wireless connection from anywhere in my house where previously I had only a few decent hotspots
##(My router is stuck in the basement surrounded by metal ductwork from the air conditioning - not optimal location!)
internet[@]##The interesting thing is that the signal strength doesn't actually seem much different anywhere; what is different is that I can establish an excellent, fast internet connection even when the signal strength is only two or three bars, whereas previously anything under 4 bars you could forget about it
##Setup is not the easiest in the world and it took a phone call to get it right, but tech support was easy to reach and solved my problem competently
##The router seems loaded with cool features and it's not at all expensive
##Awesome job D-Link!
[t] Excellent router
##I bought this to replace a 10 year old Netgear wireless router that was failing
##I have been impressed by the ease of the setup, and the range and power of the wireless signal
##My old router did not cover the entire house, this router covers it all and extends into the back and front yards as well
internet[@]##From a performance standpoint, I see improved throughput passing packets through to the internet compared to my older router
##This is not wireless performance, since 802
##11N is faster than 802
##11G by design
##but is rather an indication of the packet switching performance of the router itself
##Highly recommended
[t] Won't go wrong with this
##After wasted 8 hours on Linksys WRT610N router, I boughts this with PCMCIA card for one of my laptop
##What a difference it made
speed[@]##Laptop is running at full speed with excellent signal
##You won't go worng with this but here are some tips- Do peel off the platic film which protech the router but covered the venting holes
port[@]##Otherwise, the router might get overheated and reset- MAC filter not only block wireless device like most other routers, but it also filter device connected to the ethernet port
##I wasted some times here and eventually figure it out
##Be careful here!- Do update the firmware first thing you login to the router
##Otherwise, do backup configuration before you do the firmware upgrade, Most of the configuration will lost and you would have to reconfigure it again
software[@][u]##- Use the web interface is much straight forward, insetad of the  that come with it- Be aware of the default ip is 192
##168
##0
##1, rather than 192
##168
##1
##1 on most other routers
price[@]##-Do pick up Dlink 5 or 8 ports GB switch at the bargain price with $10 rebates
speed[@]##I ran a cat6 cable for my PS3 and many other device ( like NAS), speed is so incredible
##Love it
##and you will
[t] D-Link DIR-655
##Router came with a CD
##I connected two wired PC's and wireless laptop in no time at all
##I have read that router was hot to the touch, it is barely warm
##Excellent buy
##Very pleased
[t] Recommended! Worked great for me!
##I've been wanting to upgrade from my Linksys wired router for a few years but held off due to mixed reviews and pricing on the newer Linksys wireless units
##I recently discovered the D-Link 655 and read mostly good reviews with some exceptions
##I ordered the D-Link 655 on July 23rd and wow am I pleased
##I used free super saver shipping with USPS and received the item on July 25th
##I guess living in NJ helped with that as it appears the item shipped from Jersey City, NJ
internet[@][u]##To setup the new router I used the included Network Magic setup CD and left my desktop computer hooked up to the  through my old Linksys wired router and Cablevision / Optimum Online cable modem, as instructed
##The item shipped with the old Firmware version 1
##10 but ths did not cause any problems
##The setup CD program found the old wired router and stepped me through every step of the way to setup the new wirelss router
##Everything worked fine the first time
##Using the Network Magic software, I hooked up two wired computers, one wireless laptop and my son hooked up his PSP wirelessly with no problems
##Signal strengh and performance are excellent
##The Network Magic setup CD also made my printer and "My Documents" folders shareable on my home network
##I updated the Firmware to 1
##11 from the D-Link support web site with no problems
##There is a even newer Firmware version now available but I did not upgrade yet as it was just released earlier this month
security[@]##Setting up WPA security was a bit more of a challenge, but I got that working in about an hour or two for all computers and my son's PSP
##I'm very pleased and highly recommend this product to anyone looking to easily setup a wirelss home network, including non-technical users
[t] Easy to setup with great range
##Replaced my old Linksys B/G wireless router
##Much greater range and was easy to setup
speed[@][u]##I have a Dell laptop with a wireless N internal card and the transfer  is amazing
##Router is also very reliable with no drops
[t] Setup was ok, works great
##My Netgear624 router, which had served me well for several years, finally decided it had handed out its last IP address
##Since I had years of trouble-free service, I replaced it was a brand new Netgear624
##This was a disaster
##I finally put it out of its misery with a
##357I took a chance and bought the DLINK-655
speed[@]##I only use it for -g connectivity- none of my wireless nodes are -n, since I use wired connections for anything that I really need to be high speed
##The setup was a little hokey
internet[@]##Somehow or other DLINK managed to create an automatic router configurator which needs to be connected to the internet to work
##I am sure it works great, but until my router is configured, I can't connect to the net
##but at least it provided a good laugh
##My network is a little bit complicated
##It has a 5 Windows XP compters, a Mac, a couple printers, a half-dozen NAS devices, a few SONOS boxes, network switches, subnets, a camera and an second wireless access point
##It took only a few minutes to manually configure the router, and it seemed intuitive to work through the menus
##although they are certainly organized differently than the Netgear interface I was used to
##While I am an engineer by training, all of my network knowledge is self-taught, and I certainly don't consider myself an expert
##The router has been up about 12 weeks now, and has required exactly 1 reboot, and I think that was my ISP's fault
##It has been rock solid, and I get good signal strength everywhere in my 2 story house, and about 100' out into the back yard
##The only flaws so far
[t] Works great, excellent tech support
##I had a little trouble getting it to work out of the box
##The configuration wizard didn't seem to recognize their firmware, and said I didn't have a D-Link router connected to my computer
##I called tech support, and got hold of a real person in about 1 minute
##He walked me through the manual configuration, skipping the wizard, in less than five minutes, and since then, everything has worked perfectly
##What a contrast with Linksys, a few years ago, where I was on hold about 90 minutes to get hold of tech support!
[t] Works for me
##I replaced my Linksys (turns out unnecessarily) with the d-link
##Both were working OK as wireless routers
##Linksys was easier to set up with their web-based configuration service
##d-link slipped Network Magic into their"installation procedure"
##While I really like Network Magic, now that I'm using it, I felt that d-link "conned me" into spending the extra money for Network Magic
##The d-Link web-based configuration is not for the inexperienced (unless you just use all defaults)
##On the other hand, it is so extensive that an expert tecchie could have lots of fun tweaking the d-link config to precisely what they want
##I believe d-link has a more sophisticated set of configuration parameters
##Good for experts, bad for novices, and *very bad* for expert wannabees
[t] The best out there (seriously)
##I've now owned ten (10) wireless routers (and before that, wired-only routers with separate wireless access points)
##Two years ago, I had to replace my trusty Linksys WRT54G (the antenna degraded to a point of no return)
##I purchased a NETGEAR WNR2000 (which I exchanged with NETGEAR corporate for a WNR834Bv2), Belkin N+ (small buffer overflowed and rendered my Slingbox useless), and Linksys WRT160N (whose wireless radio went bad after three MONTHS)
##Right before acquiring the D-Link, I purchased an Apple Airport Extreme (which I had waited years for)
##You know what? The ~$80 D-Link is better
##I couldn't get USB-attached storage to work on the AirPort, yet it works FLAWLESSLY on the D-Link
##"One computer at a time?" Share the drive using Windows/Samba
##Problem solved
##This is the best router I've owned
##My *only* complaints are for the time-wait after small changes in the admin interface, and the Wireless-N is single band and doesn't operate too well with computers expecting dual-band (2
##4/5
##2)
[t] Returned Unit
##Speed was terrible
##No matter how much I tried to reconfigure the settings I couldn't get to function properly
##Returned router within 2 weeks
[t] D-Link 655 N
##This router was selected to replace one that was a few years old, and was dropping connections regularly
speed[@]##The D-Link allowed me to up-grade to N from G, as well as add some speed
##So far, so good after a few weeks of use
security[@]##Ease of set-up, and setting security was welcomed
##I'm expecting years of great service
[t] Great speed! Easy setup.
##The router has been working great for the month or so that I have had it
##I used to have a Buffalo wireless router that only support B and G
speed[@]##The Internet speed on my laptop was always slower running the wireless compared to when I plugged it in with a cable
##I do not need to do it with this router
speed[@]##The speed is fantasic with wireless N adapter in my laptop
##The option to setup a guest network is another useful feature
##My kids like to have their Nintendo DSI's and this let's me use encryption that works on them
[t] Replaced Airlink AR675W No difference?
##I purchased this unit to replace an Airlink AR675W
##I have a cable modem connected to the router
##Connected to the router I have a D-Link DNS-323 network attached storage
##One Xbox360
port[@]##A D-Link DGS-2208 8 port switch
##Connected to the switch are two computers, another Xbox360, a Western Digital WDLive mediaplayer and a Pioneer networked receiver
##The D-Link maybe a little faster but does suffer from occasional disconnectsfrom the(Cable Modem)internet
##The Airlink rarely dropped the cable modem signal
##The Airlink is waaaay cheaper
##The D-Link LOOKS cooler and has more options for experiencedusers
##Gamers or people with network attached storage will find it easier to setup permissions
##If it is in a bedroom you may have trouble sleeping with all the blue flashing disco lights!They are VERY bright
##Think black tape bright
##SUMMARY
[t] Average speed / easy setup.
##I set this up and connected it to my Dell Dimension running Windows 7 64bit
##I used the setup disk and it installed without any issues
##Everything worked fine
##Once I had it setup, I updated the firmware
##Before upgrading the firmware, I backed up the configurations from my initial working install per instructions
##After the firmware upgrade, I updated the configurations with my backup
##After this nothing worked
##I tried to manually set the configurations again but no connections
##I was able to get everything working again by pulling out the install cd and going through the initial setup again
##After this, everything was working again
##Making any additional configuration changes can be confusing
##The configuration utility is extensive but not very user friendly
##This router replaced my Linksys WRT54g
speed[@]##I was hoping to get better speed and range
##The range was not much better than the Linksys
##In some spots, it's actually worse
speed[@]##Because of the range issue, I'm not getting much better speed from distance
speed[@]##When I'm closer to the router range, I do get better speed via wireless n
streaming[@]##One thing that has helped me with streaming dvd's or other video files over the wireless network is to use VLC player(open source media player) instead of windows media player
##Files that skipped, stuttered, stalled and froze playing through Windows media player played perfect with VLC player
[t] Good so far
price[@]##I had D-link before but after two and a half years it just stop working I can remember seeing this item two years ago and the price was way two high for me
price[@]##I looked at the price and features this time and it was just right , the d-link is easy to set up just follow the the set up wizard
speed[@]##The speed of it is great and really broadcast through out my apartment
##So far this thing is working fine but in time we will see how it goes until then
[t] Great Router!
##This router is an excellent piece of equipment
price[@]##For a wireless N router, you can't beat the price
security[@]##It is very rich in features and the security is thorough
##I had no connectivity issues yet
##I've connected a PS3 wired, brother printer wireless, windows vista laptop wireless, and iphone wireless
##All work perfect and connect easily with WEP key
##Very happy indication lights as well
##Big upgrade from my 54Mbps Netgear
[t] Nice Router
##Was difficult to set up, not as intuitive as others I have used
##However I called D-Link support and they were VERY HELPFUL in getting this manually set up for me
##Wireless works very well
##Highly recommended
[t] Amazing deal!
##I found this router in a PC magazine write up, priced at close to $200
##Lucky for me, I found it on Amazon for way less
##As for the unit itself
##it is a home network, connecting 1 PC, 2 Laptops, 1 PS3, iPad, TVand never skips a beat!
[t] Great router
##I have had this router for about a week now and I'm impressed
##I access the wireless network via my laptop and also using my HDTV
##SPEED/RANGE
[t] No Problems, Easy to set up
##I'm an old computer professional but this is my first wireless router
##This router explained the basics so I could properly set it up with the wizard without having to learn everything there is to know about wireless technology
##I haven't had to restart it once since I first brought it online
##There are lots of features, most of which I will never use, but they are there if I ever need them
##This is my third D-Link product and I haven't had one issue with any of them
##In contrast, the Netgear wired router I had was unreliable
##I'm buying D-Link from now on
[t] Solid purchase
##Had this router for about a month
##Very easy set-up and good range
##I'm very happy with product overall
[t] One of My Best Purchases!
##I bought this router because I got tired of not being able to use more than one device online at a time
##I have my laptop, xbox 360 and blu ray player all connected
##I am far from a computer wizard and it only took me 45 min to connect all three devices
##Not too bad considering it is my first time setting up a wireless network
##There is no lag when playing games on xbox live
##Actually the games run smoother than before
##I have read a lot of reviews that complain about the heat
##Well there is a stand included in the box, I sat my router on top of it and heat has been a non issue
##I mean this thing barely gets past room temperature
##Just make sure its in a clutter free area with no dust and you should be fine
##I have had it for a few weeks and have had no problems
##Well worth the money!!
[t] What a router!
##This really is a great router
##Setup was a bit tricky with my system, but the tech-help was superb
##The range is perfect, and I feel it's very secure
[t] USB drive doesn't work
security[@]##I bought this Modem from Amazon looking at overall reveiws and thought it is value for money considering its speed,USB drive connectivity and security
##But it seems that feature of USB shareport is very problematic
##After connecting the USB external memmory drive(I have Toshiba 500GB) it started to give some sort of clicking sounds and it just got disconnected from the Internet totally
##Also I had to reboot the modem many times while trying to use USB memery drive
speed[@]##The speed also seems to be very slow when I try to use USB drive
speed[@]##On top of it I found that this USB drive I can not even access/see using the utility provided by D-linkAnother thing I noted is the speed of wirelss Internet is much slower than one I got at the the very beginning i
installation[@]##e right after Modem installation and setup
##I'm afraid it is something to do with the USB drive connectivity issues I had faced earlierNow after all of this experience I have decided to return it and get some better modem
[t] Excellent Product
##Very easy to use and set-up
##Got it working in less than 10 mins! Slightly on the expensive side, but the modem's range and reliability more than make up for the extra cost!!
[t] Great Product!
##The Dir-655 is a great router
##The wirless range is the most noticabe feature
##I get a great signal everywhere in my two story home
##Setup was a easy and the interface is intuitive
software[@]##Not huge fan of the "Shareport" software
software[@]##Only draw back is the software will only allow one system at a time to access the USB device
port[@]##I would recommend buying a NAS device that uses an ethernet connection, rather than the USB port
##Overall
[t] Could Be Better
##I'm going to focus mostly on the USB connectivity which is really what sets this router aside from most of the others
##I was torn between this particular line of wireless N routers and the Airport Extreme Base Station mainly for their use of shared hard drives over a network
##I spent a lot of time trying to research this before hand but documentation or even clear reviews on how reliable the USB Shareport performed was scarce
##I went on a limb and purchased this over the Apple and a mnow partially regretting that decision since the one feature which was most important to me performs miserably
software[@]##First there is software which must be installed before you can even access the networked hard drive and it is buggy at best
##Often preventing your system from shutting down or redrafting normally
software[@]##There is third party software which is slightly more stable but again performance is sub par
##My read / write times averaged in the single megabytes per second range and this was typical of both wireless and wired access iwith multiple file systems being experimented with
##I
##e
##NTFS, FAT, and HFS
##Once I disconnected the drive from the router and plugged it directly into my MBP many of the files were corrupted or completely inaccessible
software[@]##The software also gave me error messages saying another device was accessing drive which was impossible because there are no other machines looged into my network
software[@]##Needless to say I removed the software and have my external hard drives hooked directly into my computer
##The router by itself performs wonderfully but this feature is utterly useless and since it's debut in '06-'07 no amount of Firmware has seemed to fix these issues which after a little more digging has led to post after post of complaints
[t] Great for Gaming
##I bought this mostly for the purpose of improving my connection during black ops and bad company 2
##This router really works! I went from being a 10-10 type player (or worse) during team deathmatch to being a 20-10 player just by using this router with my xbox instead of the router comcast gave me
##Before, I would see a player, aim down the sights and start shooting, only to end up dead
##When watching the kill cam, apparently the person had time to see me, aim, fire, while the whole time I never officially did shoot back
##Now it is much more even
[t] Phenomenal Product
##This wireless router was just what I was looking for to complete my home network
speed[@]##The speed and reception on this thing is fantastic
##No wireless phone interference, no resetting it every day to make it work like other products I've used
##D-Link knocked this one out of the park
##It may be a little more expensive than others, but the value is extreme
##Super-happy with this purchase
[t] Firmware still faulty with 2.0.0 in late 2011 - dns hangs
##This router is fast but the firmware is both lacking and still has a dns relay bug
##Dns relay is enabled by default
##This means that the router gives out itself as the dns server in dhcp
##This is common however d-link's dns relaying has a flaw
##Dns lookups are cached and fill up the allocated dns memory
##Once this memory is exhausted the router hangs on subsequent dns lookups for about ten minutes until the memory is cleared and the caching starts over
##I have the latest firmware 2
##0
##0
##I experience this issue about once or twice a day
##Turning off dns relay fixes the problem but the router should not be broken by default and this defeats the benefit of dns relay which is faster dns lookups
##One thread detailing the issue
[t] Not As Powerful As I Would Like
##I read the reviews before purchasing this wireless router, and thought it would be better than my old Linksys
##The range of the Dlink is not as good as the Linksys for some reason
##I have it in the same spot as the old wireless router
##I wanted it because it is a newer model with "N" capabilities
##I have a new laptop and thought using a new wireless router with "N" would make it faster and the reception better in my home
##So far, it has not met my expectations
internet[@]##I am going to re-route my internet connections to another part of the house to make it more efficient to cover as much area as possible
##I didn't have to do this with my old wireless Linksys
##Maybe I should have stayed with Linksys???
[t] Big Bang for the Buck
speed[@]##I just changed from DSL to cable for the higher speed broadband, going from far less than the advertised 1
##5 MB with DSL to 28
##58 MB consistently via cable
##My son is an online gamer, and the wireless router is located on 2nd floor, while his PS3 is located in the basement
##He is getting at least 7 MB now, with no lag times or crosshairs jumping around when someone calls on the land line
##But, while I am at it, I will drop my land line as well
##I researched many wireless routers, but for less than $65, this was a screaming buy
##I am not disappointed with any aspect of it, and it was set up in less than 20 minutes from the time I opened the box
[t] So far so good!
##I've had this unit for a week now
##Setup was super easy
##I was replacing an old D-Link wireless router from 2008 that lasted me 2
##5 years so it was easy to migrate the configuration from that one to this one
##All devices connect without issue
##The key with the antenna's is to point ALL of them in the general direction of where most of your wireless devices will be in the house
##It may look strange, but it adds several yards to the overall range
[t] Fast but wireless distant, well.....
price[@]##My husband and I loved the price
##We priced it at ***'*, and was a really good deal
##But as far as the distant of the wireless
##My husband has an iPad and I got an Archos
##We only get as far as the front porch and then no reception
##Our older router was able to reach full reception all the way out to our front gate
port[@][u]##Other than that we love the USB share 
[t] Updated - Nothing special...Average router
##Updated
[t] Fix for the Conflict caused by AT&T's modem
##I had problems initially getting the D-Link 655 to work with my AT&T modem properly
##After doing some research I discovered that the problem was that this router uses the same IP address as the my Speedstream 4100 modem
##Once I changed the IP address on the router I had no more connection issues
##If your Google "D-Link 655 + Speedstream" you should be able to find some good information on this conflict and how to resolve it
##I believe I changed my router IP setting to something like 192
##168
##2
##1 Now that I have the router configured properly to work with the Speedstream I am very happy with it
##Even though I had some setup issues I am still giving the router 5 stars since the problem was caused by the Speedstream modem, not the D-Link router
[t] Great Router, Great price
##I have had zero problems with this router
##It installed easily right out of the box, set up software, updated firmware, and walked me through setting up wireless encryption
##Within 30 minutes of removing the shrink-wrap I had two PCS, a laptop, a PS3, and a web-capable blu-ray player all connected from various points around [both sides of] a duplex
##While the PC users were surfing and watching youtube, the PS3 was playing a game, I was watching Netflix on the big screen TV at the other end of the house and nobody has had any problems!One reviewer stated that his unit got "
##so hot he could barely touch it
##" but either he had a bad unit, or forgot to take the plastic scratch-guard off the unit, thereby blocking the vents(?) Mine has been running 24/7 for a week now and is barely room temperature
##Heat is not an issue
##The *only* caveat I have (already mentioned by another reviewer) is that the blue lights on the front of this router are indeed bright! You will not want it in the same room you sleep in - or anywhere else they would be distracting
[t] Great Purchase
##I have made such a great purchase of an items technology that I have no clue about
##I did extensive research of different versions of wireless routers and made the decision to purchase the D-Link
##What a fast, solid performer
##I am sitting in my living room 40 feet and numerous rooms/walls away from router and have excellent signal strength
security[@][u]##I set up  settings during the simple setup and feel confident with its features
##Best of all to this point was the customer service
##Yes I had to call customer service during the setup
##It was a simple procedure, but because of my unfamiliarity with my new laptop, I did not turn the network switch on
##I did not know this, and called the D-Link customer service
##She attemted to resolve the problem and after a few minutes was more than curious when it was discovered that I had made the error
##Look no further when looking for a decent, upper midlevel router for your home or office use
