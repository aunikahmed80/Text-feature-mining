[t] a decent phone for its price
##this phone is better than the older V3 motorola phone
screen[@]##It has a much better screen resolution and responds faster
##But the interface takes a little time and effort to get used to
price[@]##But on the whole decent phone for its price
[t] Good Phone and worth the price you pay.

##good call quality,audible,no issues with signal and reception
##Got 1 bar when I was in elevator and call did not get disconnected
##- Battery life
##I allow it to discharge almost to 5% then charge itback to 100%
##Battery stays for 2 days with minimal usage and close to day and half with lot of usage (only calls, no browsing)
##- Appearance and interface is very much improved and looks good
##I have been a loyal amazon customer for close to two years, had no issues with any of my orders
##On time delivery
##Some issues I had were- Transferring phone book
internet[@],software[@]##Used a software from internet to transfer from my contacts from Outlook to Phone memory
##- No CD or handsfree along with the product
##Need to get itseperately
##- very glossy, so need to clean it sometimes to remove fingerprints
##All in all a really good phone with required features
[t] TRY ANOTHER PHONE
##TERRIBLE PHONE, REPLACED BATTERY TWICE AND IT STILL HAS TO BE CHARGED DAILY WITH MINIMUM USE
##CALLED MOTOROLA FOR HELP
##CANT HELP YOU, GO BACK TO THE SELLER
##NEW BATTERY DIDNT HELP
##SO I HAVE TO KEEP A CHARGER WITH ME ALL THE TIME
##CANT RECEIVE OR CALL FROM MY OFFICE ( IN A BUILDING) WHILE OTHER PHONES WORK, LIKE NOKIA OR BLACKJACK
[t] good phone, but deceptive
##Some things people need to know about this phone
##Good
[t] MOTO Store Discount
##Use this code at the online Motorola store to save 15% off most items
##Here is the code
[t] N75 - Unbelievable value for the money
price[@][u]##This is a very powerful phone at a ridiculously low 
##I love it
[t] Great
##This is my first cell phone
##I enjoy it so much
##It charges fast and is so cool
[t] the speaker phone is not that great...
##The phone's case on the back did not close properly
[t] Very powerful, versatile phone
##For years, ever since the "old school" days, my cell phone of choice was always a Nokia until about three years ago, when I opted to upgrade to a Motorola v551
##While overall, the v551 was a nice phone, there were some Motorola quirks that really soured me on considering a new Motorola device
##So, when the time came again to upgrade my device, I started to do some real reserach to find an all around good phone
##I considered waiting for the new iPhone, but couldn't see plunking down $600 on a non-3G capable phone (first generation to boot)
##Nokia's were out simply because many of them are not flip phones and even the ones that are weren't aesthetically pleasing
##Compounding my problem even further was the fact that even though the RAZR's looked nice, I read way too many reviews that highlighted its many shortcomings
##And, it was a Motorola, plagued with the same quirks that I had hated (one example, the fact that I had to create a separate contact for every phone number I entered, even if it was for the same person, another was photo quality and yet another was the charger
##)After reading the reviews for the V3xx, I was intrigued
##For one, Motorola revamped its operating system, making it more user friendly
##Secondly, the v3xx was 3G capable, had a powerful camera, and could be used as an MP3 device
##These were the things I was looking for, and after reading the reviews, I figured I'd give Motorola another chance
##I've had the phone for three days now and I'm very pleased
##It has a nice sturdy feel to it, the buttons and "joystick" are easily used and feel solid
##The display is very sharp, it takes great photos and has a few photo tools to help make your picture look good
sound[@]##The reception is also very good and phone calls sound crystal clear
##The speakerphone is average, sounding just like most speaker phones do (like a tin can
internet[@][u]##) The  browser, with the 3G capability, is great and I can actually see myself using the media features as opposed to having it simply as a novelty like I did on the v551
##The streaming video and music is great and I hope that Cingual expands the selection of titles as well as length of programming
##I still have yet to try the mobile e-mail function and the mp3 player, but I don't have any doubts that they will perform well also
##To be a semi-serious mp3 player, a micro SD card is essential, as well as either a bluetooth hedaset or a 3
##5mm adapter
##Perhaps the only gripe I can come up with at this time is the outside display is not as bright as it could be, and I find myself having to look very hard to see what time it is or whether I had missed a call
##On the v551, the display would light up bright blue and even when dimmed, the time was still easy to see during the day
##To sum up, if you're considering a phone that that doesn't require serious business use, give the V3xx a try
##I'm very pleased with my purchase
[t] had high hopes
##I really had high hopes for this phone
##Previously I had a cingular v3 for 2 years and couldn't have been happier with that phone
##So, in looking for a new phone, naturally I went with the v3xx because of the 3g network, new screen, sd slot, and all the new features
screen[@]##Everything was great with the phone, screen is awesome, data transfer is quick, phone looks great, but I could not get over the most important thing in a phone
[t] Not quite what I hoped for
##I have changed to GSM and selected the V3xx phone as the Motoroal V60 was the best phone I have ever owned
##The Razr V3xx has some short commings that anyone considering it should know about
##First of all you have to have the phone really centered on your ear to hear it at its best 1/4 inch makes a difference
screen[@]##The front screen is too small to read incoming call numbers, so it is useless for caller ID
##Both inside and external screens are hard to read in bright sunlight
##The srceens are great in reduced light or indoors
##The start call(green) and end call(red) buttons are right next to buttons that start the AT&T browser or CV both of which will cost you if you press one by mistake and cancel as quickly as posible, you learn to look at the buttons you are pressing, not a good idea if you are driving
##I have not been able to find a good blue tooth device to use while driving
##I have purchased two units with built in speakers and three ear piece devices
##The best is the Motorola H700 (I bought it from Amazon to avoid fake look alikes and the $99
##00 asked by AT&T)
##The H700 is scratchy but usable in a car
##The quality and volume of the blue tooth on any of the devices I have tried is about equal to the built in speaker
battery[@]##The last issue with the phone is battery life, if I am lucky I get two days charge on a battery
##I probably place or receive four to five short calls a day
battery[@]##Sometimes I run out of battery on the second day, so now I just plug the phone in each night
##My old phones Nokias, Motorolas, and Panasonics (all digital not GSM) lasted between one or two weeks on a charge
##I guess I'll have to adjust to the new technology!
[t] Great phone, make the leap to this Razr its worth it
##I have used Nokia from day 1, but I decided to try this Razr, because I had heard that Motorola fixed a lot of the problems that the original Razr had
camera[@][u]##This phone has great reception, brilliant screen, awesome  for pictures, bluetooth works very well with hands free link in my car and very easy to text with
##I haven't downloaded music yet so can't comment on that aspect
##This phone is also very nice looking I must admit
ringtones[@]##The only problem is the ringtones that come with this phone are awful, they force you to go buy ringtones which I think is absurd
##Great phone otherwise, highly recommended
[t] Got this phone on a second try....
##When I first went in the store to upgrade my phone, I got talked into getting a LG CU500
##I liked the features of the phone but did not like how it handled my calls, (went silent for a minute or two alot during calls)
##So I took it back and got a Razr v3xx since I have had a Motorola phone in the past and it got great service, not to mention that I did some research and alot of people seem to really like them as well, (online reviews and friends referral)
##I have to say that this is a really nice phone and I haven't had ANY problems with it at all so far and I've had it now for 2 weeks
##So I'm super happy with it and glad I traded the other one in for this
[t] DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM AMAZON (or any other phone)
##My boyfriend bought this phone for me from Amazon and it was the worst idea ever! First, when I got the phone it couldn't be activated due to technical problems (due to Amazon, not AT&T;)
##I called Amazon for assistance, and they forwarded me to their cell phone department who said 1) they didn't know what the problem was, 2) there was no one else that I could speak to, and 3) they would email (NOT call) me back
##Amazon gave me the run-around for over two weeks
##Finally, i took the phone into an AT&T; store
##They informed me that is was most definitely a REFURBISHED phone
##They also told me the reason there were so many problems activating the number is because the phone number BELONGED TO SOMEONE ELSE! I called Amazon to discuss the fact they had sent me a refurbished phone when I had bought a NEW phone, and they did not have an answer
service[@]##The very nice customer service representative said that he would have someone email me back (because the cell phone specialty department did NOT make any calls)
##It's been two weeks and I still do not have an explanation as to why I was sent a refurbished phone or why I was assigned a number which was already assigned to someone else
##DO NOT buy phones from Amazon
##Although you pay less for the phone, it's not worth it!!! Just go it the store and deal directly with the cell phone company
[t] Poor quality, pooer service
##The phone is neat and comes with a lot of great features, but buyer beware-the warranty is basically non-existant
service[@]##We had a problem with the keyboard and called for warranty service and they said that the warranty is invalid if there is any water damage
##We explained that there was no water damage, it just stopped working
##They asked us to check a "dot" sensor on the phone
##If the dot is red, the warranty is invalid
##We asked how the dot could be red when the phone (2 months old) never got wet, and their rep told us that rain, sweat or being exposed to humidity or condensation! An unscientific survy of razr uses at a soccer game found 4 of 5 with the dot turned red-and hense no warranty
##So bottom line is, it is a good phone, as long as you don't sweat or live in a location where it rains or gets humid
[t] best performing razer
##Solid performance
##3G network is great
##and oh so thin! Most comfortable phone to carry around in your pants pockets
[t] AT&T Lies about Dropped Calls but phone is not problem
##I was talked into this phone when I almost used my old Motorola as a hockey puck when it "spontaneously died" along with 2 other Cingular customers who also had the Motorola V557- Our phones just powered off and would not power on, and we were all within a month of contract end and planning to go to Nextel
##However, the phone has performed well
##Battery life could be more like I was led to expect, but it is ok
camera[@]##It charges best if turned off, and the camera (not a critical accessory) is phenomenal, sometimes outperforming my wife's digital
##However my carrier is still big disappointment
[t] Cool design with some "need to get used to" features
design[@]##I definitely like the phone for it's slender design and features
##the only thing that gets me is getting used to actually using the phone
##trying to make sense of call history, or to quickly access some of your items can be trying for someone who is not as tech savvy with cell phones
##i enjoy the phone and it does what it supposed to do very well
screen[@][u]##make and receive calls!clear audio quality, no dropped calls so far and a HUGE  to see things
##after reading the guide and sitting down with the phone for an hour or two and re-programming it,
##it's a lot more user-friendly
##it's as good as any other phone for text msgs
battery[@]##good battery life and if looking for accessories, definitely look for a snug holster to avoid this phone from feeling loose in its case
##You can also find good accessories at Radioshack
[t] Hijacked by cingular
##This is an amazing piece of equipment
##I have used the RAZR V3 for 2 years
##This is only that much better
screen[@]##Bright screen
##Brillient Graphics
##Fast operating system
##Huge memory
camera[@]##Decent camera
##Quantum improvement over the original RAZR v3The downside
[t] Awesome after an easy hack
##I've had a non-3G RAZR for a couple years, and recently upgraded to this
##Coupled with an unlimited data plan, this is an absolutely stellar phone
##Users of past RAZR and similar Motorola phones almost won't recognize the OS
##It's been hugely improved in almost every area - camera, media, address book, messaging, storage (including a a Transflash slot)
##It's also very snappy
screen[@]##Hardware-wise, the screen is bumped from the old 176x220 to 240x320 (QVGA)
##It's silky smooth and bright
##If you live in a Cingular 3G area, the HSDPA data is amazingly fast, and the voice quality is orders of magnitude better than any cell phone I've tried before - crystal clear
##The built in browser is okay, but it really shines with the free Opera Mini browser
##The only disappointing thing is that Cingular has crippled the network access for Java applications
##Using a non-Cingular Java application such as Opera Mini will have the phone asking your permission to access the network every single network request it makes
##This gets really frustrating really fast, but a fix can be found with a little bit of googling
##Don't bother with this if you don't get the data plan
##get a KRZR instead
##many of the OS improvements are included
[t] Razr V3xx is the best Razr phone availble.
##The V3xx excels so much more than any other razor phone
##The V3xx has a 247mhz Arm9 process which the V3/V3i/V3r only have a 40mhz processor, V3x 70mhz,Krazr K1 only has a 66mhz processor
##Also the V3xx has more built in memory than any other previous Razr phones with 60Mb expandable w/ upto 2GB SD
##Another note the V3xx has the Nvidia Goforce 4800GPU which is great for the gamer
##I had much faster framerates on my Java games
battery[@]##The Goforce 4800 also conserves battery life when you are not using the phone
##I had the V3r razr and the batter drained much faster
screen[@][u]##The V3xx comes with the best  so far with 240x320 Qvga 
##The old Qcif screens just do not look this good it is amazing
##V3xx is a HDSPA 3G phone one of the only ones that cingular provides
##It is much faster than the old GPRS/Edge/UMTS formats and allows for faster data downloads
##Streaming video, and audio is also availble which is a great feature
screen[@],camera[@]##The video camera is very good and supports full screen playback
##Lastly the phone supports A2DP stereo bluetooth 2
##0 support
camera[@]##Only drawbacks of the phone are the camera 1
##3MP the Goforce chip supports upto 3MP and Motorola should of done that
##Still most razr phones only have VGA or 1
##2MP
##Another drawback is the buttons ofcourse this is something common amongst all razr phones

[t] Best phone out there!
##Prior to purchasing this phone, I had used a wide variety of other phones from Cingular with having settled on the V551 for a while and then even upgrading to a Palm Treo 650 since I wanted easier to use options of email, internet, text messaging and mp3 player all in one
##Well after the Palm got old and I wasnt using as much as I thought I would and with the extra weight of the Palm, I decided to buy a v3xx after reading all the reviews
##I just cant say enough about this phone! Some of the great features I've noticed just in the few days since Ive had it
[t] Awesome phone!
##The title says it all
##It's got lots of features but I don't care about those
##I don't need my phone to take pictures and play MP3s and all that, even though this phone does those things
##I just need it to reliably perform as a phone
sound[@]##My last (Samsung) phone had very poor sound quality and was often unusable
##This one is awesome
sound[@]##The sound quality is superb, even in places that used to give me trouble with other phones
##It's also very stylish, light, and fits easily into a pocket
##Fantastic graphics
##This is just an awesome phone
[t] Great phone, minor changes, only tri-band
##I recently got this phone thinking it was quad-band since that is what Amazon advertises
##However I checked some websites and found out Amazon is mis-advertising and this is actually only a tri-band GSM 850/1800/1900
##Although Motorola downgraded this aspect of the phone, you should still be able to use the phone in most countries (after having it unlocked) since services that run on GSM 900 also run on 1800 I think
##Overall, having previously used a RAZR V3, I love this new V3xx
##1) Camera is now 1
##3 MP (compared to the V3's 0
##3 MP), however, 2 MP would have been better
##2) Screen is significantly sharper and the graphics are improved
##3) Phonebook allows for multiple numbers per entry
##4) External keys are now silent, so if you have previously used Motorola phones, you will find this a blessing; you no longer will be embarrassed when changing your ringer setting
##Some more upgrades include
[t] easy to use even for me
##I upgraded an old phone to a Sync just three days ago; at the same time, my son got a Razr v3xx
##In comparing the two phones, several things about the Razr prompted me to go back and exchange the Sync
screen[@]##The Razr keeps a subdued clock on the outside screen at all times; the Sync does not
##The Razr is much easier to open with one hand
##The Razr has voice-dial; the Sync does not
sound[@]##The Razr seems to have a cleaner sound for calls
##The Razr is simply easier for me - an almost 40-something with no technical skills - to figure out
screen[@]##The screen icons are cleaner and the menus are more intuitive
##I had the Sync for three days and still could not figure out half the stuff I wanted to
##I've had the Razr for 3 hours and have already set it up the way I want it, including locking myself out of those expensive Media Net buttons
##There's even a way to lock the AT&T; Music feature, but keep the ability to use the music player, which is in that menu, by making the music player one of the Navigation keys
sound[@]##Plus, the Razr is just prettier!The only thing I can think of that I don't like about the Razr is that the speaker does not sound very crisp at all
##If you listen to music, I recommend headphones
##Update June 2011 - I'm still using this phone, and it's still awesome
##It never quits
##My son has the same phone (he's now 17) and neither of us are easy on phones
battery[@]##It's simple, intuitive, light, and the battery life is still days long (we've never replaced the batteries
##) If mine ever dies, it'll be a tough decision whether to upgrade to an iphone or just get another Razr
[t] Motorola RAZR V3xx Phone (at&t/Cingular)
##I just bought this phone two weeks ago and my observations are as follows
[t] Pretty good phone
##I think the Motorola v3xx is a nice phone
##It performs the basic functions of a phone pretty well which is to make and receive calls
##I haven't explored the other features much
##I've been using it for about a month and didn't find any problems with it
battery[@]##Reception and battery life are good
[t] Best Motorola phone I ever had.
##Ok, Im goin to start by saying that over the past year, I had the SLVR L7 (Great MP3 phone) Sony Ericsson W600i (Best phone with stereo speakers) Samsung Blackjack (Ok Internet phone)Well I just got this phone yesterday and I had been using it for over 4 hours and I think from all of the phones, the Motorola V3xx is the best because I didnt have to buy any accesories for it since it uses the same accesories that the Slvr uses
##When I first open the box and saw the phone shining, I was amaze because if you see in the pictures, the phone doesnt shine and if it does, its not as realistic as it should be
##I put my blackjack's micro SD card and I turn on the phone and all my songs was recognize by the v3xx, Before i bought this phone I was wondering weather if you listen to the songs in the phone and close the lid of the phone if the music would stop but No it didn't
##When you close the lid, in the litle display, it tells you the song and the artist and you dont need to open the phone to change songs
##With the side buttons, you can change volume and songs
##But the best thing that this phone offers is the BASS feature
##Whenever you are listening to the songs, (go to options and select music options) there you an control the bass feature
##It sounds good if you have the 3
##5mm motorola adapter
##(you can get it in amazon for 5
##00$) I would say that this phone is way better than the krzr because this one have 3G and its fast
##If you have a laptop, all you have to buy is the bluetooth adapter and use the phone as a modem, you DO NOT need the USB cable, although you could use it
##Overall this is a great phone, Camera is good (WAY better than the razr V3)
battery[@]##The reason why I return the blackjack was because the battery suck, and I realize that I didnt need a PDA phone
sound[@]##The speaker is pretty loud although if it was stereo it would it had a better sound but this phone doesn't need another speaker
##This phone has everything you need on a phone
internet[@][u]##The  browser is really good
##I can even go to [
##] and browse everything as I did with the blackjack
##If you are a teenager or someone that needs a phone for calls and a lil more
##Than I recommend this phone
##This summer im goin to Puerto Rico and im goin to see if I can use it there
##3G is available in PR so im sure that I wont have any problems
##If you have a ? just post it in here and I try to answer it
##Hope is helpful
##I'll be adding more updates as I use this phone

[t] Rotten experience with Cingular's customer service.
##Long story short, I called Cingular for the first time today and spent nearly an hour trying to get someone there to port in my old number
##What a frustrating and rotten experience, including being given the wrong number to call, and then being told that it was the wrong number (by a rather rude representative) after being put on hold for a long time
##After some more bad customer service, I finally got to a supervisor and told him that this was perhaps the worst &quot;customer service&quot; I'd ever experienced, and that this was my first and last day with Cingular
##I can not imagine ever needing to call them down the road for something and going through this type of frustrating hassle again
##I am going to send the phone back and order another one with ANOTHER CARRIER! Too frustrating
[t] v600
##this phone look good but don,t work when press number don,t work speakerphone dont workmake alot fuss drop call a lot this is a bad phone motorola have good phone don,t know what happen to this one if i could give back it would be gone
[t] Worst Customer Service
##I received this phone 10 days ago and I'm still trying to activate it
service[@]##The phone looks cool, but what's not cool is the service at Cingular
##Cingular claims that porting a phone number from another company usually takes that long!! The long waiting time, even when you want to talk to a manager, is more than 15 minutes
##I have decided to go back to T-Mobile
##They're more experienced and friendly
##I don't want this phone because of Cingluar
[t] Bad design - drives me crazy
##Push buttons on the rim are exposed and active even when the cover is closed
##They cannot be disabled
##These buttons control ring profiles so that the phone will change to silent without warning
[t] Pretty damn good, if you can live with the address book
##I moved from Sony Ericsson T68, so my comparisons will be based on that as a benchmark
##First of all, let me say that on paper this new fashion-conscious flip-phone is about the most impressive you can get
[t] V600 has been recalled/discontined by Cingular
##The V600 model was originally designed for AT&T
##Due to the AT&T/Cingular merger, Cingular decided to take this model as well
##However, Cingular could not get the phone to fully work on their 850Mhz network
##That is why they started replacing the phones of their V600 customers for V400 models
##All this corrective process (call it recall, if you wish) is carried out by Cingular exclusively
##As per the phone itself, the V600 is not being recalled or discontinued by Motorola but is being recalled and discontinued by Cingular
##It is just Cingular's network that is not capable of supporting this model
##An easy way to test this is to try and activate this phone through AT&T
[t] Just little things...
##There are only two things that I really dislike about this phone
[t] Cool Phone...Horrible Battery
##I think I have the worst of luck when it comes to batteries and cell phones
battery[@]##I would have given this phone 5 stars except that the battery life isn't as long as advertised
##Overall, I love this phone and am glad I bought it
##I have been with Cingular for almost 10 years (it was Bellsouth prior to that) and I've been rather satisfied with them
service[@]##Friendly service (not to mention they actually answer your call)!PROS
[t] Not so great
##I purchased this phone in June and in Sep
##The volume no longer worked
screen[@]##I received a replacement phone and now the screen freezes and you cant see the time or caller id and it shuts off by itself
##I would not reccomend buying this phone
[t] What a great phone!!
##I have waited months for this phone to be available in the states
##Unfortunately, I was not willing to spend 300
##00 for it
##I was able to purchase this phone for $99
##00 with new activation from Best Buy
##Not only did Best Buy have great savings on rebates, they also threw in a Motorola Bluetooth Headset (worth$99
##00) for free!! What really sweetened the deal was that Best Buy would pay up to $75
##00 for your first cell bill! The phone has amazed me from day one
##I am not the least dissapointed in the product
##I noticed some people are complaining about the phonebook
##People you have to read your MANUAL! My nine year old daughter knows how to add multiple phone numbers to one contact name and she didn't have to refer to the manual! The phone is not difficult to operate
##There are so many ways to customize and personalize your phone to make it easier to navigate through the menus
##I hope this review helps anyone who reads this review
##Good Luck on your decision!
[t] Is This The Same Phone Ya'll Have?
##I have had my phone for 14 months (Jan
##05) and love it
##It is small, easy to use and works with my bluetooth earpiece for an exceptional hands free device
##I have never had a problem with the speaker part either
service[@][u]##Now, I bought this phone through T mobile and I love the 
##The reason I bought this phone was because it can be on the free international plan
##I used it throughout Europe this past summer and never had a problem; I felt like I was sitting next to the person I was talking to
##And at $
##99/minute, it is a dozen times easier and cheaper than finding a phone card and trying to use the European phones
##I also can take some fabulous pictures on my phone
##I have never used the games nor have I used the voice dial (I'm middle-aged so don't have the need nor the inclination to take the time to figure it out) but everything else works like a charm
[t] DON'T Buy it!
##H
##J Spivack's review (12/17/04) is dead-on! I have experienced the same issues and frustration with Cingular & this phone
service[@][u]##My advice, get a different phone & 
##Received the first phone in June 2004 and now in May 2005, I am on the fifth phone
##Each time a problem has come up (buttons didn't work, display stops working, phone answered the call on its own (while sitting on the desktop), etc
service[@]##), the service has been tremendously awful (1 hr on the phone) and my only viable option is to receive another refurbished phone
##The company tells me the replacements are "reconditioned" and suggested I contact Motorolla
##Even after clearly articulating I was dissatified with the quality of the phone and service, my request for a refund and/or different phone at their cost was denied
service[@]##This company is not customer friendly or interested in maintaining any level of customer service or satisfaction
##Add to that poor phone performance and it is a lose-lose scenario
[t] Apparently there is a recall
##This seems to be an excelent product
##I went to purchase it this morning at Cingular
##However they are no longer selling it
##Not many details were provided, but apparently there is a recall due to some bugs
##This is no official information, but check before you buy it
[t] Cingular is deceptive!
##My review is on Cingular
##I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used
##THEY LIE
##THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY
##THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area
##If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular
##Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse
[t] Motorola V600 does not function
##70% of all calls to or from my phone are dropped
##In one 50 minute call the signal dropped 5 times
##Cingular just keeps trading my phone for a new one
##None of them work
##I would not recommend spending $250+ on this phone as it does not work
[t] Heaven has come to the earth

##First time thru our transit system I dropped the phone
##My eyes begun to fill with water as,I focus on the unit lying on the floor
##I pickup the phone stood on the side and,checked to see if it still worked

[t] Heaven has come to the earth
##I received the unit last week, the phone sounds and feels great
##First time thru our transit system I dropped the phone
##My eyes begun to fill with water as,I focus on the unit lying on the floor
##I pickup the phone stood on the side and,checked to see if it still worked
##It still works perfectly and no scratches to boot
##Motorola you have exceded my expectations
##No more candy bar style phone for me
[t] For its price, it should be much better
##I used the v60 for 2 years, so that will be my point of comparison
##The v60 was just an amazing phone that peformed great, easy to use, AND great looks
##It easily surpassed all phones of its time and was worth the big bucks
##The v600 is just over-hyped and does not live up to the V-series name
##The v600 is loaded with features, and offers about anything a cell phone can these days
battery[@]##The voice clarity is excellent, reception is excellent, battery life is very good, and speaker phone clarity is good
##The v300 has every feature this phone has minus Blue Tooth, yet the v300 costs half as much
##Motorola seemed to have messed with a few critical things on the menu that has made it much harder to use
##For example, you can only set your Caller ID to be shown or hidden for the next call only
##There IS NO WAY TO SET YOUR CALLER ID TO BE HIDDEN OR SHOWN FOR ALL CALLS!!!! Hence, I have no way of predicting when my Caller ID is hidden or shown! Why the heck did Motorola go against all common sense when they decided to change the menu system?!?!Motorola even skimped out on providing a belt clip, which is very unlike Motorola
##For a $300 phone, I would at least expect a belt clip
ringtones[@]##Motorola says this phone has 21 ringtones
ringtones[@]##Well, about 12 of those are actually vibrations or short beeps, which don't really qualify as ringtones
ringtones[@]##Of the other 9, only about 5 make decent ringtones
ringtones[@][u]##I don't understand why this phone has so few  when the v60 and v300 have about 30-40 tones each
##The bottom line is that the v600 is not a bad phone, it's just over-priced
##The v60 matches the v600 in functionality and performance
##So if you can live with out a color screen, blue tooth, and a camera, stick to the v60
##Or opt for the much less expensive v300
[t] Good phone? Might be. Order from Amazon? Bad idea!!!
##The fact that I am giving this phone a 2 star seems a bit unreasonable for the phone itself because I haven't really used it yet since I got it from Amazon
service[@]##The phone is to ordered together with Cingular service and contract, which was what I did a month ago
##The package arrived a week after I first ordered, without SIM card which is listed in the invoice
##I went through the process of an exchange immediately by printing out the return label and dropping it off at a UPS store
service[@]##A couple of days later, I got the bill from Cingular with first month service and activation fee, etc
service[@]##I called cingular (multiple times) and cancelled the whole service
##Then when I was emailing Amazon to get instruction, I was told that a second package, with the PHONE ONLY, is sent out and I MUST go to a Cingular store to purchase a SIM card and seek refund from Amazon
service[@][u]##So now, a month after I ordered the phone and  from Amazon and a good number of emails back and forth with Amazon (who respond to emails more and more slowly), the status is that I have the phone, unusable (no SIM card), debating whether or not I should return the whole thing (and wait for 4-6 weeks for them to refund the money to my credit card) or go to a Cingular store as they proposed
##Conclusion
[t] For anyone planning on buying the V600 using Cingular
##Take the advice no one offered me
##Don't
##This phone was recalled by Cingular (although they insist that it was recalled by Motorola, which Motorola denies) three weeks before I bought it
service[@]##They sold me a recalled phone and required me to sign up for 2 years of service
##Two months later, I was told it was recalled and they offered to send me another (refurbished) phone
##I told them I wanted to be credited for the phone cost which they refused
##So they sent me another cell phone (V600)
##The new one is missing part of its front cover casing
service[@]##I called Cingular and they said the only choice was to to send another phone, cancel the service ($200) or buy a new phone for whatever I pay out of pocket
##This is unacceptable
##If you buy this phone, don't go with Cingular
##The only reason that the phone is a 2 and not a 1 is that you can actually make telephone calls on it
##It does work for that purpose
[t] Phone is nice, bad software, low volume
##As a phone, it is a nice piece of equipment
##The LCD looks nice and the phone has lots of features
##I decided to return it because of the following reasons
##First, with the volume set at it's highest, the volume thru the earpiece, speakerphone, and headset jack were just too low
##I even have a volume adjustment on one of my headsets, and the volume was just too low
##I have 4 other cellphones, none of which are this low, and I could only carry on a conversation in a quiet area
##Secondly, the headset jack didn't always recognize that a headset was plugged in, even if I were to jiggle the cord, the jack, didn't matter
##The reason I even tried the phone was that my Verizon Wireless contract was up, and I liked Cingular's deals
service[@]##I found their service and coverage to be fine, I just wish I didn't have these problems with the phone, I ended up returning it for a replacement which was the same
software[@]##If they ever work the software bugs out of this phone, it would rate a 5 out of 5
##Today, it's 3 out of 5
[t] Cute, but that's about it.
##This phone is very cute, but not the best when it comes to volume
##It's very low, and if you're in a noisy place, you won't be able to hear the person on the other end of the line
##If it's quiet, you won't have any problem hearing at all
##It also turns off for no apparent reason
##If I open it too fast, it turns off and I have to turn it back on again
##Other than that, it's a great phone
[t] The Good, The bad and the Ugly....Well the BAD mostly.
##Hi, I have had this phone for less than a month
##In very recent history, I have owned, Motorola v60G, Nokia 3650, Nokia 3595 and a few others
##Please read the last couple of paragraphs on Motorola's support
##I bought this phone for three major and one minor reasons,1- Flip2- Speaker phone3- Bluetooth4- quad band (minor)I will compare the phone with the units I have owned
##V60G was and is a solid phone and I intend to keep it as my backup for a while
##I loved the sturdyness, the comfortable feel and the stability
##I got this phone free as part of a deal(Thanks AMAZON, not sure why a lot of other people are having problems with rebates with Amazon, i never have had any problems)
##Nokia phones are also very nice
##The 3650 was very powerful, LOADED ( and I mean loaded) with applications and functions
##It was very easy to use, I was able to use th bluetooth function to use the phone as a modem to dial out and to sync with my laptop with less than minimal problems
##the speaker phone was excellent, easy to use and loud
##This phone cost me about the same as the V600
##Now the V600, the speaker phone is mediocre
##Not very easy to use
##I mean, I cannot turn the speaker on while I am dialing a number or even after I press ok, i have to wait untill the call is connected and then wait a couple of seconds before I can turn the speakerphone on
##Not a very useful feature
service[@]##I have had problems with volume and I have verified service and reception
##The volume seems to be very low MOST of the time even while I am talking to the same folks
##The phone constantly hangs (you would think this was a Windows 95 based phone)
##I would get a call and the keys would be all locked and cannot answer the phone or turn the ringer off
battery[@][u]##The only way to shut it up is to remove the 
software[@]##I have not been able to use the bluetooth function to sync with my laptop even though I bought the additional software which by the way came free with the Nokia phone but here it is not free
##All other features and functions are skimpy as well
##For the price, I think this phone should have better set of apps included with it either pre loaded or as an option on a cd
##Last and the most important, I am very disappointed with Motorola's support
##When I called, they told me to ship the phone back to them or take it to a motorola shop (which by the way is more than an hour drive from me)
##No option for a replacement while I use my credit card as security deposit was given
##They do not seem concerned about the fact that some people use their cell phones as their primary phone and/or business phone
##I decided to call the local motorola shop and right away the gentleman said, "is this about a V600?" and then told me that Motorola should not be telling anyone to call them as they cannot do anything for me
##He gave me a different 800 number to call and said that he was instructed to forward all people to that mnumber
##I think, There should be MUCH better support for a phone that is supposedly a top of the line and technology phone
##Granted, the gentleman on the line from motorola was very polite and nice
##Bottom line, unless I was buying something directly from motorola, I am not buying anything motorola in the future
[t] Nice Phone
price[@]##This phone has a pretty full set of features, is a nice size, and can be gotten for a reasonable price
##It isn't perfect but if you're looking for a clamshell with these features, you will probably be very happy with this phone
##This is a sturdy little phone
##It just feels like you can drop it and it will be okay (I haven't tested this but I like the feeling)
##It has a nice set of pim features like an easy to use 1000 entry contact list and a calendar that is easy to read
internet[@][u]##It also has GPRS, WAP, and Bluetooth so you can connect to the  for email, showtimes, news, and so on as well as being able to connect to other devices with Bluetooth
##This is really nice
internet[@][u]##My wife can surf the  from her PDA or laptop through her cellphone using bluetooth (by the way  access is free through t-mobile - not their t-spots or t-zones but data access to the  is available to everyone for for free
##) Bluetooth also lets you do wireless handsfree devices that are nice
##You can be up to 30 feet away from the phone and still talking over it with a bluetooth earbud
##My wife is also able to dial her phone by choosing a contact out of her contact list on the pda and using her earbud, she never even has to open her phone
software[@][u]##There is  available that makes synching the phones contacts and calander with Outlook very easy either using bluetooth or either a USB or serial cable
software[@]##This software also allows you to send sms messages from your pc using your phone
##OK
##so the phone and it's accessories can do just about everything but polish your shoes, if you take the time and figure out how to make all these things work together
##This may or may not be a task that you consider to be worth your time
##It isn't for everybody
##As far as the phone goes, the quality of it is good, like you can pretty much expect from Motorola phones
##You can make it pretty with all sort of different wallpapers, you can personalize the layouts of the menues to make things convenient for you, you can store audio and moving and still video on the phone
##You can download midi,
##wav, or
ringtones[@][u]##mp3 files for 
##You can pick these up all over the place for free and copy them over as easy as can be
##The only way you can get motion video on the phone is to copy it over to it
##You don't have any means of capturing it
camera[@]##You do have a sorry little camera though
camera[@]##If a camera is important to you in a cellphone, this is not the phone for you
##The pictures are tiny and very low resolution
screen[@]##They are good enough for the screen on your phone but that's about it
##I have enjoyed my time with my wife's phone and do not want to give it to her now
##I'm thinking about the possibility of losing or having an accident with my trusty old v60 to give me an excuse to upgrade!
[t] Nice phone, but it hates OS X
##The phone is sweet, but don't even think about using it with your mac
ringtones[@]##The bluetooth will allow you to copy pictures and ringtones back and forth from your computer to your phone
##But, iSync doesn't work at all
##Not with bluetooth
##Not even with Motorola's USB data cable
##You can use a 3rd party app (onSync) to copy with the data cable, but it won't copy your calendar information at all
##And while it will copy your address book, contacts with multiple phone numbers will be listed separately for each number in your phone's address book, making it totally cluttered
##The phone itself is nice and all, but what's the point of all this newfangled technology if you can't use it?Maybe hold out for an iSync update
##Maybe hold out for Tiger
##But, if I can get out of my Cingular contract, that's exactly what I'll be doing
##My advice? Take a Texas on this one (El Pass-o)
[t] Great Little Phone
##The Good
[t] Beware- Looks good, but that is about it.....
##Have had this model for over a year and I have had to exchange it 3times
screen[@]##Due to my screen disappearing
##I called t-mobile and asked if there is a recall on this model, but they say there is not
##Also I have noticed that the rescpection decreases after 3months
[t] Rating for ordering not phone
##I ordered this phone and a V400 from Cingular
##the order was cancelled
##I was told by amazon
##com that they can't tell why
##they gave me a Cingular number
##I called Cingular and was given the run-around
##eventually, they told me they can't tell me why it was denied and that I have to ask amazon
##com
##this is amazing
##I have very, very good credit so I know it's not a credit issue
##I'm frustrated because I ordered it on the day the phone had a significant rebate and now the rebate is no longer valid
[t] GRRR!!
##I hate this phone and this service!! Anytime I try to type a text message or type a name for a phonebook entry my cell freezes up! It cuts out on me every 10 to 15 minutes while I am talking!!!! GRRR!!!and many other things the list goes on!
[t] Great Phone, lots of features
##I bought this phone in PA discounted for college use so its already great off the bat
##Its bluetooth is a great feature on the phone
##If you have bluetooth on your computer($30 some places) then you can wirelessly transfer songs, pictures, or whatever else you want for no extra charges
ringtones[@]##I've made my own ringtones from songs on my computer and just sent them to my phone using this, so now when it rings I hear the actual song
camera[@]##The camera is also very good with a 4x zoom and the speakerphone is great, although you can't activate it until you start talking to the person
battery[@]##Also has a great battery which lasts several days on standby
[t] Great Phone!
##I have been waiting for a phone with Bluetooth technology, as well as a phone that will not become obsolete in a few months
##My wait is over! I walked into the Cingular store near me and they had just gotten in the V600
service[@]##With a 2 year service contract, I got the phone for $200
##Expensive these days for a phone, but worth it! This phone feels solid, unlike some other phones that feel like they could break if you look at them the wrong way
##The phone has everything I needed and wanted
camera[@]##Some complain about the camera, but, hey! Did you buy the phone to talk of take pictures with? There isn't any phone I have seen that will take a picture better than my digital camera
##So, when I hear or read people complaining about the camera, it makes no sense
##The sould on this phone is clear
##It is a Quad band, so I am not worried about not being able to use this phone anywhere
##I wish the phonebook would list numbers by catagories (family, friends, etc) but it is easy to get to a name by just hitting the number that corresponds to the first letter of the name
##I am enjoying this phone, which is something I have never been able to say about a cell phone before
[t] THIS IS GOOD
##I THINK THIS IS THE MOST FINE AND GOOD PRODUCT I EVER SEEN WITH MY EYES
##IT'S REAL GOOD AND LIKE TO OWN IT
[t] Love everything about the phone!
##I am suprised at how great the phone is, I had the t720 before and I hated everything about it
sound[@],ringtones[@][u]##But the Mp3 tones on the phone sound great, and with the built in bluetooth, it is easy to make my own  and transfer them
[t] Pretty good... some glitches
##After receiving my phone from Amazon, it was a pain to activate the phone through Cingular because some representatives had no idea what they're doing
##Also, Amazon ran at least 9 credit checks under my name so I could not activate my phone at a Cingular store
##After all the red tape, I finally activated my phone through Cingular Porting Dept
##I had downloaded some ring tones but somehow they got lost on the phone along with some pictures that I took also
##The pictures show up because they're attached to someone in my phonebook, but not in the 'picture' section
ringtones[@]##The ringtones were showing up under 'Ring Style', but not anymore
software[@]##I've owned a few Motorola phones before, they're prone to software glitches, so I'm used that
##I'm lucky that I have friends that work for Motorola
[t] Great phone!
##The style is great and the menu is so easy to use
##I recently got this phone this past weeekend and haven't had problems with it
##Ignore all the bad publicity that you've heard, if you like it you should get it
[t] Simple, Elegant and Powerful
##This is my second motorola phone in last 4 years
##i used to have a V60 and then i upgraded to this V600 model
##i really liked by v60 and i like V600 even more
##the phone is very simple to use
camera[@]##it does have a camera but i rarely use it
##the picture quality is alright, but thats doesnt matter to me that much
##what really matters to me is the functionality and the call quality
##after all thats what the cell phones are for, arent they? the call quality is nice, if you use speaker phone you will like the clarity
button[@][u]##the best feature i like about the phone is that you can change the ring style by the press of  on the side without even opening the phone
button[@]##press the down button once and then press the button underneath the down button to switch from loud to silent to vibrate to vibrate & ring
[t] Nice phone
##This phone got a lot improved from the previous model of V300
##Compare to V300 plastic cover and low resoultion of color, this phone sure gives you more of each things
sound[@][u],design[@]##A unique design with the metal cover, the bluetooth supported, 64k color and you can go with actual MP3 ringtone on it! It  a lot better than the way V300 
##The reason I am not giving it five stars - because battary life doesn't last long, the phone is a little bit haveyer than what I have excepted, the phone somehow lagging bad when you call out and receive calls
[t] Cheap Speaker/Bluetooth Phone
##This phone was an upgrade from my Nokia 6010 (a very reliable phone, but that time had passed by)
##I wanted a speakerphone to avoid carrying the wired earpiece the 6010 required
##I wanted Bluetooth to take advantage of my Palm TX PDA with a huge contact list
##The build is mainly plastic
##It's so light, I can barely feel it in my pocket
##So thin, I don't think it could withstand much of a fall (though I haven't tried yet)
##The keypad is small, and if you're not comfortable with alot of fingernail dialing, I would look elsewhere
screen[@],size[@][u]##The screen is very nice, large relative the  of the phone, easily readable in daylight
##The Bluetooth works well, I can dial using my Palm TX PDA
##Transferring records from the PDA or PC does take time, as each individual record has to be "accepted" one at a time by the L2
##You can transfer video, pictures, music via Bluetooth fairly easily from a PC
##The speaker is acceptably loud, and audible over traffic if you are in a car
##The volume dialing is only "up," so you have to cycle through 7 volume settings to get to the lowest setting again
##Call quality is equal to my Nokia 6010, reception slightly worse, but not significantly
##Battery life is 24-36 hours with standby/frequent calls/heavy Bluetooth/speaker use
##The address book does have an irritating feature of making each phone/fax/email entry a separate listing, which results in one name being listed several times
##A good phone for cellphone "bottom-feeders" such as myself looking for a simple phone with speaker and Bluetooth and not much else
[t] Great phone
##I've been waiting for a phone like this - a phone without any frills but gets the job done perfectly
##Pros
[t] A very practical phone that has the cool look as well
##I've been waiting for this kind of phone
camera[@]##I don't need any camera (most of them produce poor picture anyway) or mp3 player (you can never replace iPod with any cell phone built in mp3 player)
##Just give me a phone that works best for phone calls
##Business user will appreciate all the extra solid and basic functions
##A speaker phone, quad band (for international travel), bluetooth and very sleek looking metal casing
internet[@]##Using the latest Motorola Phone Tool with bluetooth, I can connect to the internet with 115 bkps, it uses GRPS though, not the prefered EDGE technology
##I was impressed by the ease of signing in my Yahoo email (it also has AOL and MSN preinstalled) and messenger (AOL and ICQ are available too)
##I also tried to access my Gmail account, works great
[t] This is going to be long##I have this phone for about a week now and I like it well enough
##Took some getting used to after so many years with my Nokia 3120
##I wanted small and slim and this one fits the bill
##I think it's pretty "hand happy", meaning it feels good in my hand
##It took me a lot of playing to figure out all the menus and settings (not as easy as on the Nokia), and the manual is virtually useless--and set up in a rather illogical order
##I mean, really, who puts info on how to text message before the setup options and menu map?Anyway, I like that the navigation buttons are completely customizable
##You can program the middle up/down/right/left keys to be shortcuts that YOU want, not what Moto thinks you want
screen[@]##You can program the left and right softkeys under the screen to lead where you want, as well
button[@]##You cannot reprogram the two side buttons or the center menu button
##At first I thought that the two side buttons (ringer options and voice dial) would be in the way and constantly be activated, but I haven't found that to be the case
##They are nicely out of the way, yet convenient when you want them
##I do find the dial keys slightly small, but I can work with it
design[@]##A design flaw that another reviewer noted is that the microphone is on the side of the phone rather than bottom center
##If you are "right eared" this can be a problem as your cheek might muffle your voice, especially if you tend to press against the phone
##If you are "left eared" it's easy to put your finger over it
##Another reviewer noted that the phonebook uses a separate entry for each person's separate phone number
##This was a major disappointment to me, because my Nokia had all numbers stored under each directory entry and all I had to do was hit "view" to see them
##I later found that you can do this with the Motorola, but it's not easily to find out how by reading the manual
##Here's how to do it
[t] Great phone for it's targeted market
##I purchased this phone as a backup to my Cingular 8125 (as I hate taking that thing outside of work--love that phone, but it is freaking bulky!)
##My basic requirements were
[t] it looks good
##I wanted 4 major things in a phone
[t] I agree, its a cool phone and all......
##I had my phone for a while, until unfortunatly put it in the washing machine with my clothing
##i am not saying its a bad phone for not living through a washing machine, i didnt expect it tooi loved the size, weight, feel of my L2, it is a really cool phone
screen[@],internet[@][u]##BUT, what always happened to me, since the phone is " capable", a feature i dont care to use, the phone buttons would accidentaly be pushed at times and its little  screen would load up,by the time you have a chance to react and hang up, data has already been sent and recieved, you get charged by the amount of data that the phone recieves if you dont have a plan for it, which a lot of you will not get (a guess)
##so my cell phone bills would be 48 and 54 dollers when they are supposed to be 39
##99
##and for sending and recieving 0 text messages, thats a pretty high mark up
##i would recomend the phone, its very cool, but buyers, be ready to have unneccisary fees tacked onto your monthy bill
[t] I'm a phone techy, but its a good phone!
##Hello, before I dive into this review let me 1st state that i'm into high tech, imported Nokia phones
battery[@]##I havent owned a motorola phone since 1994 and way back then it was one of the 1st flip phones that took up all your pocket space, battery lasted an hr and lcd displays hadn't been invented
##My carrier was comcast metrophone which, i'm sure anyone under 30 dosent remember
##An unfortunate thing happened a few months ago
##My super high tech Nokia N70 (not avail in the usa and cost me $450 on ebay) fell into the washing machine for 5 seconds
##5 seconds is life and death when it comes to water and you cell phone, and it drowned
##Of couse Cingular didnt even know I had the phone and since it was imported from Europe no one in the world would fix it
##I promptly ordered the awsome Nokia N73 but it would take 3 weeks to arrive
##When I called Cingular I found out that as an AT&T; transplant I was actually due a new phone
##The Motorola L2 was free and I needed something to get me thru 3 weeks so I ordered it
##I wasnt dissappointed and I'll keep this phone as a backup
##First I'll anayazye the many steps down but it dosent mean its a bad phone
##Ok there is no calander
##Second, it can only hold a total of abt 100 combined text messages
##When you have 50 in your outbox and 50 in your inbox thats it
##Because at my workplace I cant talk on the phone , I send a lot of txt mssgs, about 400 per month thats a problem
camera[@]##Also there is no camera
##Not even a little one
##I used to take print quality 5x7's at 2
##0 MP with my Nokia N70 so I missed this feature
software[@]##Out the box there is no backup software for contacts
##I'm not a big cellphone gamer but there are no games included
##This could be listed as a pro and con but its a phone
##Pure and simple and because of its simple minded approach to life let me addess the pros
##Pros
[t] this is an aweful phone
sound[@]##I have had this phone replaced twice - once for sound quality and later for it losing the capability of sending and receiving calls
##I am now giving up on the Motorola L2 and getting a different phone
##Sound quality is really bad
##With each replacement phone, my friends and family continue to complain that my voice is garbled and sounds digitized
screen[@]##On warm days, the screen fades in color and functionality greatly diminishes
##People seem impressed by the sleek look of this phone, but it is not worth the hassle
##Bulky flip phone here I come
##Motorola should stop making the L2
[t] This phone is terrible
##I have not tried bluetooth with this phone, and I have not tried using it outside of the U
##S
##That being said, I'm listing pros and cons below
##I've had this phone for about 6 months, and have given up and am looking to buy a new phone before I'm due for an upgrade with Cingular
##I never had a problem with Nokia in the past, and I'm going to buy that brand from now on
##Pros
[t] Motorola needs new software engineers
##I like the hardware of the phone
##Its slim and it works reliably
##That is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1
##The reason I didn't give it any more is because the phone while it works, is very annoying to use
##The people designing the user interface must have been smoking something really bad
##1
##No auto-lock
##You have to manually lock the keypad
##Extremely annoying for people who have been using the auto-lock feature on the Nokia phones for years
##2
##Volume control is dumb
##To actually lower the volume you have to crank it way up before you can lower it
button[@]##There is only one push button to control the volume and it cycles through the volume presets
##Dumb, dumb, dumb
##3
##Phone Book
##Motorola has the dumbest phone book of all the phone manufacturers that I know of
##Want to enter 3 phone numbers for your friend (work, cell, home)? That will be 3 entirely separate entries in the phone book
##People have been complaining about the dumb phone book in Motorola phones for years
##Does Motorola listen? No
##They are fat and happy and waiting for a rude awakening
##4
##No note taking ability
##Would it have killed Motorola to provide a little note taking app that many others provide? Sometimes I just want to write some small note down, maybe a part number or something and dont have a pen/paper handy
##And the list goes on
##My wife and I have sworn off of Motorola phones
[t] Premium Quality in a Basic Phone
##As a former FCC licensed radio tech I have always been very impressed with Motorola's excellent commercial radios--high performing and ruggedly constructed! And it appears to me that their cell phones are a good step up from the usual plasticky Asian brands
##The L2 in particular has the look and feel of a semi-commercial grade piece
##A nice clean form factor, ideal for pocket carry
screen[@]##Good tactile keypad feel and entirely adequate screen
##Above average RF and audio performance, as expected
camera[@]##And, a refreshing difference, no camera
##Better to have none than low quality VGA
##In all, a real quality piece for anyone wanting only the basics in an elegant upscale package
[t] What is it good for?
##Although the phone is sleek/slim, it is too long and too wide
##Its too big to fit comfortably in a pocket
battery[@]##As others have noted, the battery life is very poor
##Motorola needs to learn something from Nokia
##I'm sending this back to Cingular and getting a Nokia
[t] L2 Meets the most basic of needs
##I lost a RAZR due to finally dropping it one too many times - but I only had $40 invested so it was not like the end of the world
##I was able to find my L2 for $50 cash on craigslist - it had a charger with it and was in excellent shape - but it is not a flashy phone with lots of bells and whistles
##It does however have a nice speakerphone which performs pretty much up to the same quality as past phones
##Battery life is suprising good - most reviews are not very good on this phone but I am thinking maybe they have bad batteries? I just discovered the key guard - after dialing someone a few times in the middle of the night
##ooops - anyway its "menu, then the *" to activate the key guard
##Thank you to the person who posted that information here
##Hope you found some useful information! Good luck
[t] Good basic phone with no bells and whistles
##This is the phone I am retiring now after about 20 months of use
##So I guess I am not allowed to badmouth it too much
[t] Good Basic Phone
##This is a great phone for those who just want the basics; calls, IMs, texts
battery[@]##This phone gets great reception, has good battery life, and isn't easily breakable
screen[@]##I've dropped mine at least 10 times or so and the screen isn't scratched at all and everything still works fine
battery[@]##It seems that whenever it is dropped the back battery cover does comes off though, but it easily snaps back on
##A bit frustrating to connect to a PC with a USB cable considering the drivers aren't automatically installed by windows and the phone doesn't come with them (to my knowledge)
##Even when you manage to find the drivers for it, you cannot access the phone's internal memory through a usb cable, you have to use a pc bluetooth adapter
camera[@]##If you are looking for features like a camera phone, mp3 player, or easy PC compatibility, this phone isn't for you, get the higher end cousin, the SLVR
battery[@]##If you just want a small sleek, light, durable, basic phone, with good battery life then this is a great phone for you, especially if you are like me and hate flip phones
[t] not worth the cost
##I'll start with the positive
size[@]##One thing I really love about this phone is that if you purchase the software, "Motorola Phone Tools" (and usb cord if you need one), you can take any mp3 song stored on your computer and use Phone Tools to crop any size of an excerpt from the song and then transfer it to your cell
##And then you can use that song excerpt as ring tones, alarm clock tones, etc
camera[@]##I like that this phone does not come packaged with a camera
camera[@]##I want a phone, not a phone with a terrible camera that I'll never use and have paid extra for
##Unfortunately the negatives on this phone (at least for me) strongly outweigh the positives
battery[@]##--From day one I have had troubles with the battery on this phone
battery[@]##Extremely short battery life and even shorter when using a motorola bluetooth headset
battery[@]##In fact, I had to send this phone in to motorola 3 times b/c I talked on it until the battery died and the phone shut off
##and it absolutely WOULD NOT power back on
battery[@]##Motorola replaced the battery twice and some part in the phone once
##However, the phone still has the same problem
battery[@]##I've just learned not to talk once the low battery indicator starts beeping
battery[@]##---I have to charge the battery every night
##(And I do not talk on the phone all day long
##)--The keys on the phone are uncomfortable to use, especially with nails
##--The volume on this phone is POOR
sound[@][u]##(I really miss the  quality I had on Nokia)
##--The volume on this phone accompanied with a high-end motorola bluetooth headset is THE PITS
##I can't use the bluetooth headset when driving b/c I can't hear the other person clearly
##that is extremely frustrating
##--It's annoying how you can't store multiple phone #'s under one person's name
##it ends up listing the person's name multiple times in the contact list (for each#)
##--The L2's reception is poor
##I was a Nokia user prior to this and was afforded exceptional reception and it was rare for my nokia's to drop a call
##I have always been with Cingular, but this is the first time that I have used a Motorola with Cingular
##The amount of call drops that I have now is significantly increased since I got the L2
##And I now lose reception in areas where I once had reception on a Nokia cell
##I am very disappointed that I wasted my money on this phone that has been more of a headache for me than anything else
##I'm going back to nokia
[t] great phone
##I love the L2
##Have had lots of phones with alot of wasted options
sound[@],service[@]##Who really prints out photos from a cell??? Great sound and service
##I was about to dump cingular since my calls were always dropping, then I got the L2
##No More Dropped Calls!!!OH - and for all of you who don't read the manuals or at least skim through them, you CAN quick lock your keypad
button[@]##just press the (-) button for menu then the (*) star button
[t] Good Hardware, Dumb Software
##Pros
[t] Worst phone ever
##Pros
[t] Good and solid (so far)
##i haven't had the phone for a long time but i think it's a solid phone
camera[@]##yes, it doesn't have a camera but there are some who don't want or need one
##the network seems to be confusing people and this phone is a quad-band phone
##it says on the box and on the phone itself
##i haven't had any major problems with it and it seemed inconvenient on motorola's part to not set individual ringers with you have the numbers on SIM but it's just something minor
##otherwise, there are a number of positives with this phone
##and it's not just about looks
[t] look at the motorola L6
##I have not owned this phone, but have had the L6 (unlocked for ~ $130) for about 7 monhts now
camera[@][u]##that phone is the L2 plus the  (or the SLVR minus the memory card slot)
##Been very very happy with it and everything, including the bluetooth works like a charm
##I am guessing this is not too different, which is why I gave it 5 stars
[t] whoever rate this phone 3 or lower has problems
##i did a lot of research b4 i bought this cell phone, because a lot of ppl said this cell phone suks
##and gave it a really low rate
##no offence, but whoever gave this cell phone a 3 stars or lower has a problem or they are just not that lucky
##first some ppl said this phone cannot be used in buildings and home, so wrong, i got signals anywhere include my home
##sencond
##the keypad is not that small, unless u have huge fingers, for me, it is really easy to use
##three, ppl are discussing about wheather this phone has key lock
##some ppl said no
##and those ppl go to hell
##because it do have keplock system
##simply press - and *
camera[@]##four u don't really need a cam phone, because usually the quarlity of camera is not good anyway
##so u can just use ur freinds cam phone and use bluetooth
##so i got bunch of pic of me and my freinds in my L2 now
##five i saw one review said other ppl cannot hear the voice very clearly, he said his Gf' L2's mic is on the top
##Oh well, then i guess i have differnt L2, coz mine is located at the bottom
##(unless his GF has a big face and cover up the mic
##)that is all i can saybuy it or regrat it
[t] Great Phone
##I have had this phone for about 5 months now and i have never had any problem with it
##I great reception all the time
##I also have wireless internet, text, multimedia, and instant messaging
##Not to metion the great games i get and the great sounding ringers from cingular
[t] An o.k. phone, but nothing to write home about
##I've had this phone for 4 months now
##It looks cute and feels good, but there are major shorfalls
[t] Disappointing phone...
##I purchased this phone last year sometime and have been using it since
##I am not very pleased with the phone for numerous reasons
##Let me break it down in list form
##PROS
[t] Nice features, slow response
##This is my first flip phone (with Cingular) and overall, it's pretty good
##It's light and fits well in any pocket
##However, the buttons (or software) don't respond quickly when pressed
##My friend has an older Motorola flip phone and any time you pressed a button, it responded quickly
##Not so with the V400
button[@][u]##Sometimes it takes almost 2 full seconds before your  press gets a response
button[@][u]##For example, to pull up the list of previously-called numbers, you press the SEND  once
##That always takes over 1 second before the list is displayed
##It gets annoying after a while
button[@]##I'm still used to my old Nokia 3600 (?) model that responded the instant I hit any button
##Also, it's annoying that you can't just turn on speakerphone prior to making a call
##You have to wait for the call to be completed
##Overall a good phone with tons of great features
software[@][u]##I think they just packed far too many features into the 
[t] GREAT... BUT NOT THE BEST
price[@][u]##I bought this phone for full  and it works great
camera[@]##The camera takes good pictures and the ringtone quality is awesome, even mp3
##I love the speakerphone but you can only get to speakerphone once a call has been connected
size[@]##Also The phone is a bit on the large side, but the keys are great size and spaced out perfect
##this has been rated one of the best phones for Cingulars GSM 850/1900 band network for its reception and call quality
screen[@]##The screen is also great but id like to see it have an external color LCD for photo caller id and as a photo viewfinder
[t] Dead after 2 years
##The buttons on the side frequently sounds when some object touchs them in pocket
##It is hard to open the flipper and loose many calls by not being able to open it on time
##Too heavy!!!
[t] Pretty good phone - but I can't wait to upgrade!!
##I got this phone off of Ebay and had really poor reception with the normal antenna - so I bought a booster and that has helped tremendously
##Some of the menus are kind of annoying because you need to press what seems like hundreds of buttons to get where you want
##I guess I'm being nit-picky
##overall I am pleased with it but I am excited to upgrade this spring
[t] AWESOME BUT BULKY AND KINDA HEAVY
camera[@]##THe phone is kewl and has an awesome camera and Mp3 ringers, but its kinda bulky and heavy
##I would suggest this phone for someome who wants a good phone and doesnt really car about how bulky it is
##Otherwise its AWESOME =) !!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
[t] An ok phone...
##The Motorola v400 is a great all around phone
##It doesn't have anything too extreme but you can do some really clever things with it
##It is capable to do everything except record video
camera[@]##It has a built in camera that is really good for taking photos of things that are not very far away due to its only downfall, a 4x zoom
design[@]##The clamshell design is very nice because you don't have to worry about punching numbers when the phone is in your pocket
##The display is very clear and the ability to change the ring status of your phone without opening it by the side buttons is a great feature
camera[@],ringtones[@]##Besides the obvious camera feature, the v400 has the ability to send and receive text and multimedia messages, go online and download games and mp3 quality ringtones
battery[@]##The battery on the phone is good for about three days on a single charge
ringtones[@]##Overall this phone is a very nice chioce for anyone who likes games and giving the different people on their phone different ringtones as it is compatible with just about everything you can find
[t] Looks good, functions bad
##I got this phone in June 2004
##after about 6 monhts, I noticed that the volume level was bad
##it's so bad now that when people want to use my phone, they can't hear who they're calling because they don't know that you have to hold the phone TIGHT to the ear to hear anything! I love the phone, otherwise, I don't want to replace it, but looks like i'm going to have to
[t] One of the best phones out right now
##I've had this phone for about 2 weeks now
##I bought it new and unlocked online through Amazon's Marketplace for about $235 (excl
##s&h;) but saw it on Ebay for $155 and I just thought, "Ugh
##I could've had such a better deal"
##But anyway, before I bought the phone, as a "gadget freak", I've done a lot of reviews on it
##Let's start with the phone's PROs and CONs
##PROs
[t] Great phone, but buy it elsewhere
##This is a wonderful phone
##Great color screen, great external display, great reception, great camera, great look overall
##It's full of memory to store pictures, wallpapers, screensavers, etc
##It also has all the fun caller ID features and settings everyone wants
battery[@]##It comes with two addictive games (they drain the battery
##don't play too long)
##The ringer is a little quiet and the vibrating is short and unnoticeable
battery[@]##My only real complaint is that the battery life is much, much, much shorter than advertised
##However, I would strongly advise everyone to buy the phone from another company, not amazon
##com
##There are much better deals on the Internet, and I already regret buying from Amazon
##You can find this phone for free on many other websites that are very reliable with FREE 2-day shipping (Amazon charged me a good $12 on top of the sales tax I had to pay)
##Though Amazon SAYS it includes a hands-free headset, it actually does NOT come with a headset
##Cingular includes one Motorola travel charger; Amazon includes NO accessories
##This phone deserves accessories (hands-free headset/case) and NEEDS a car charger
##Order elsewhere and get them for free! One final tip
battery[@]##A lot of people complain about the battery meter
screen[@],battery[@]##I agree that the battery reader displayed on the external screen is not very accurate
##However, there is a more reliable measure inside the phone
##(Settings-Phone level-battery meter)
battery[@]##click that to see where your battery REALLY is)
##Anyways, overall, this is the best phone for the money I've ever found
##It's amazing that such a nice phone is free--buy it while you can!
[t] Great phone, but not perfect...
##I've had this phone for a month or two, and I like it a lot
screen[@]##The screen is fantastic; I was surprised by how sharp and bright the image was
##The external display is very nice as well
##My friend has a different make of phone with an color external display, but the words on it are so small that they can barely be seen
button[@]##The keypad is easy to use, except that the blue button in the middle of the directional buttons is a bit too small
##I like that you are able to change the ring mode with the side buttons, without having to open the phone
ringtones[@]##The ringtones that come with the phone are not very impressive, but that was also the case with my previous phone (Nokia 3560)
ringtones[@]##I think they really, REALLY want you to purchase lots of new ringtones
camera[@]##I have not used the camera a great deal, but what pictures I have taken look fine
##I have yet to view any pictures I have taken with this phone in full 640 x 480 resolution
camera[@][u]##The  automatically adjusts fairly well to low-light conditions
sound[@]##This phone comes with a hands-free speaker phone, but I have not used it much because the sound output is somewhat tinny
##I have tried using it in my car, but could not make out anything that was said to me (this could be the fault of my car, though!)
##I will soon purchase a headset for in-car use
##The instruction manual is pretty much useless
##It tells you how to get to different functions, but not how to use them (such as the iMelody ringtone creator)
##The reception on this phone is decent, but not exceptional
battery[@]##The battery life on this phone is not as long as I expected
##but I must admit that when I first got this phone, I was playing with it A LOT
##Also, I work in an area that does not have good cellular coverage, and I would leave the phone on while at work
battery[@]##These two factors surely affect the longevity of the battery
##Now for the main reason I did not give this phone 5 stars
[t] Cool Phone
service[@]##This phone is cool! After shopping phones, service plans, and prices, I choose the Motorola V400 with Cingular service
##I upgraded from a Motorola V120, and was also looking at the V600, but Cingular discontinued this one due to technical problems
##I also considered the Nokia 6820 with AT&T; Wireless (Cingular now owns them)
##Plusses
[t] pleasant surprise
service[@]##I have my V400 hooked up through my T-mobile SIM card and I am glad becuase it allows me to compare this phone with my old phone(nokia 3360)with the exact same service provider
##This phone blows the nokia away with its reception
##I have one of those houses that cells always loose signals in
##not any more
##The speaker phone is not that loud and as the reception bars go down it gets lower in volume as does the earpiece, but it is not a big deal
camera[@]##The camera is great and I just ordered the data cable to transfer the pictures and mp3s to my phone and to my computer
##The rings that the phone comes with are not too great (there are only 4)
##But like I said, upload mp3s or download some rings
##Game capapibility is awsome, Prince of Persia (1) is addictive
ringtones[@]##The phone has 5mb of disk space that it shares between games, pictures, ringtones etc
##which is a nice feature
##The calender is great and you can even download applications just like a computer
##Battery life is good, I get about 2
##5 days while playing with phone costantly
screen[@]##I highly recommend it because of its programmable menus, completely customizable features and becuase it can expand any way you desire it too via games, apps, rings, screen savers
[t] Cool, little phone
##I love, love, love this phone
service[@]##I've only been with Cingular for a week but its service in Alabama is above par in m opinion
##I just left T-mobile after a year and a crappy phone (SE T300)
service[@]##To me, Cingular and T-Mobile are pretty close as far as service goes, but Cingular goes a step above with free mobile to mobile and rollover minutes
##Now on to the phone
[t] Phone has more features than advertised
##I recommended this phone to my price-sensitive friends and family members, but chose to buy the V600 for myself because I wanted 4x zoom and web access
##Both phones have this functionality
##The V400 has a larger phonebook than the V600
##The only benefit that the V600 provides is that it has Bluetooth functionality
##if you need that feature
##It is also a slightly more attractive phone
##The V600 looks a bit too oblong
##They are essentially the same shape, but the lines on the V600 create an illusion of clunkiness, whereas the the textured finish of the V400 is more refined
##sort of like a Cadillac versus a BMW
##Both have great reception and take great pictures
##Both are easy to navigate
##However, both are somewhat sluggish to respond when quickly scrolling through the phonebook
##This effect is somewhat mitigated if you switch from &quot;icons&quot; to &quot;list&quot;, but the sluggishness is a problem with the phone's memory/processor/software/whatever
##Another complaint I have is that it doesn't have the full set of TAP Extended characters in the alphabet
##For example, it doesn't contain Scandinavian letters such as &quot;A&quot; with a circle over it (&quot;AA&quot;), &quot;A&quot; with an umlaut (&quot;AE&quot;), or &quot;O&quot; with an umlaut (OE)
##It seems to have all the other TAP extended characters (eg
[t] I love the phone... but
##as with all phones, it's got issues
##- needs better ringtones, to buy some, go to www
##motorola
##com (of course, if you're paying a fortune for a phone, you should get some good ringtones, but not with this one)- the games
##well, one is ok, and common in new phones, the other, I can't stand
##To get new ones, (if you're using Cingular), go to Cingular's website, they offer better games than Motorola's site
##- also, I wish the phone was entirely constructed of metal, instead of just the part on the front cover that is
##With a 4 month old in the apartment that has recently learned to grab at everything, I would've liked a more durable phone for my money
##Otherwise, the phone is great! Great resolution, looks nice, 4x zoom on the camera, picture caller ID, and other great features
[t] Great Phone
##This phone has been nothing but great to me
internet[@][u]##It provides good connection, up-to-date  access, and cool downloads and features
sound[@],camera[@]##The camera isnt bad and the quality of sound when it rings is clear
##The phone is easy to understand and easy to use
[t] GOOD PHONE...BUT!!!
internet[@]##When I got our phones I did not like that they were not set up for internet or multimedia use, a technician talked me through setting up my husband's phone and it worked perfectly
##Mine was another story
internet[@]##I never got the same technician to set up my phone and it would never go to the internet
##Just connect forever but showed up as a connection on the bill
##After talking to Cingular till I was purple in the face I took it to a technician 100 miles away who replaced it for another phone (not a new one)This phone worked for three months then would not send or receive multimedia messages
battery[@]##It would just freeze and have to be turned off or the battery removed to do anything
##I had to go 100 miles again for another phone
service[@]##I did not really mind that I was not getting a new phone each time,however, Cingular customer service was AWFUL!!!!When my phone is working it works really well
##My husband's phone had not had one bad day for six months
##I give his phone a perfect rating
internet[@][u],battery[@]##The pictures are great, the batterly life long, connects to the  easily, has a calculator, battery meter, date book can receive reminders from e-mail and the features are beyond what was expected
##Be sure to save information to the sim card and the phone because if the phone has to be replaced the sim card can be changed from one phone to the other, no problem
##Do not allow this phone to get wet, to be played with by a child or dropped
##If there is a way to transfer pictures from the phone to the computer without sending each one in a separate multimedia message ($0
##25 each without a plan) this would be great
##Buy or get the phone and use it wisely
##I would rather not have another phone and when I finally figure out how to use even more of the features, I will be more excited
[t] Excellent phone
##I just got this phone
camera[@]##Here is what impresses me the most about this phone1) excellent voice quality2) awesome speakerphone3) outstanding display and camera (bright at night too!!)4) quad band global phoneThe bad that i really wonder how motorola missed is IRDA connection - a musct for any phones in this age
[t] Better than the V600 with Cingular
##Although the V600 is a great piece of technology, it has not been working real well on the Cingular GSM network because of excessive static
software[@]##I've heard Cingular is not selling the 600 right now because of software defects--supposedly a newer version is coming out that actually works
##Anyway, the V400 has basically the same features, a much lower cost, and far less static interference than the 600
##Definitely the way to go
[t] Next best thing to Bluetooth
camera[@]##The picture quality is excellent for a camera phone
ringtones[@]##You can upload your own pictures and ringtones to it if you want to
sound[@],ringtones[@]##The ringtones sound great and it can play MP3s
##It is a very easy-to-use phone for people who might not be technically inclined
##Cingular has MMS, which means you can send pictures, ringtones, voice recordings, etc
##to other cell phones and/or email addresses
##You can browse the internet, check your email, do voice recordings
##The Screen is the best I've seen yet on any phone
##It has everything except bluetooth
[t] Very Disappointed - Can't hear anyone, Cingular will not remedy
##I am so disappointed with this phone
##I fought hard to convince my wife I needed this more expensive model so that I could get the speaker version for work calls, while she got a plain vanilla model (Nokia I think)
##Well, the speaker phone works ok, but little did I realize until the warranty wore off is the volume of the regular press-to-ear mode fades terribly
##If you are not in the quietest environments, don't expect to hear anyone
##It's very embarrassing to call someone while driving and have to tell them you cannot talk because you can't hear them over your car (I have an '02 Subaru, so it's not exactly a monster truck show SUNDAY-SUNDAY-SUNDAY level of volume)
##Cingular wouldn't do anything for me
##I had even bought the insurance for it and asked if I could get the much cheaper, plain vanilla model my wife has
##Absolutely not, have to get the same model phone (a refurbished one)
##But Ms
##Cingular representative, this other phone is much cheaper and you can actually hear = SORRY, HAS TO BE EXACT SAME PHONE
##Argh!
[t] As bad as it gets! CALL DROPPER!!
##This phone would fool anyone, with it's great look and sleek design, but have it for just one week and you'll see the true side of it
battery[@]##Along with the buttons getting pressed mistakenly in my pocket, and POOR battery life, the phone drops calls
##ALOT!The phone drops calls worst that any phone I've ever had
##Then I came to realize that Motorola knew about this problem so they decided to recall it
##I called my phone carrier and they said thay couldn't do anything about it
##and they said I should give motorola a call
##OK so I did, and yes you guessed it
##They said that they might be able to fix the problem, but I'd have to send it to them for about two to three weeks without a loaner
service[@]##What great customer service eh?I've since switched to the V360 and it's 110% better
[t] Poor phone, worse service from Cingular
##I've owned this phone for more than a year
##It is bulky, slow-to-charge, prone to inadvertant changes in settings and finally, the keys are not easy to dial (number keys require very firm pressure, making one-hand dialing difficult)
##The sticky-key problem became so severe (no, it wasn't dropped in liquid)that I called Cingular while the phone was still in warranty
##They sent another V400, which they claim was reconditioned
battery[@]##The replacement phone had no battery (you're supposed to keep the old one) and the face of the replacement was scratched and had clearly been abused
service[@]##I kept the old phone and am switching service providers
##Bad phone
service[@]##bad service
[t] Motorola fails to impress
##This phone was my first jump into the flip phone category
##I had been using the standard Nokia phones and was looking forward to something new
##The phone is a good basic phone with all the standard features, but it comes with plenty of problems in the long run
##My speaker stopped working and the phone doesn't always charge well
##Ironically, this happened right after my 1 year warranty expired
##I'm considering switching to a Nokia 6102 which is the first flip phone for Nokia
##It has received great reviews since appearing on the market
[t] waterproof
##this is the best phone i've ever had
##i used to think i had the best phone when i had the long nokia
##i beat that thing to death i even ran it over with my car and nothing
##thew v400 althiough not as strong did survive a second story drop and has gone swimming with me on 2 occasions
##although the phone isnt perfect anymore i dare somebody to throw their cell phone in the water
##ill do it if u do it because i know mine will still work afterwards
[t] Flashy phone, but not good for real-world usage
##I've had this phone for almost a year now
##Previous to that, I had the same Nokia phone (with Cingular) for 3 years
##No dropped calls problems, no call failed problems, nothing
##Occasionally, after making a phonecall, my bars would drop down to 1 or 0, and it would take 15 seconds or so to get my signal again
##Cingular suggested that I upgrade our phone
##So, we did
##In fact, we added an additional line to our monthly plan
##So we have 2 of these Motorola V400s
##After using 2 of these for almost a year, I can tell you this
##PROS
[t] sweet phone
##i like this phone a lot
##very easy to use
camera[@]##camera feature works solidly
##lots of personalization/customization
##speakerphone too! also comes with prince of persia, one of the best looking mobile games ive ever seen
screen[@]##the outside screen lights up with a super spiffy neon blue color
screen[@]##the only wacky thing about this phone is about once every few weeks the screen starts acting up
##but i just simply turn it off and turn it back on, and its good to go
[t] talk to the phone
##this provides a perfect excuse for not talking to someone
##simply pretend to talk into the phone when peron A walks near
##when person A walks up to you, show him cell phone B, person A should walk away
##if not, the phone's 4 ounces could easily show him who's boss
##you can also get games for it, providing the ultimate in office cubical entertainment
##oh yeah, you can also talk to people with it
##very nice thing for anyone to have
[t] Having difficulties ordering too...
##I tried to order the phone as well and getting declines from Amazon, even though I have excellent credit history and I'm an existing customer with Cingular
##Does anybody know the number at Cingular where I can call and get an approval for Amazon's order?Thanks!
[t] Crap phone, and replacements don't get better
##I have owned two of these and had the same problem on both
[t] I hate the Motorola V400
##I bought this phone last April
##It worked fine until August
##-volume did not work-dropped calls-people hear me, I cannot hear them- the phone says connected, but it is not (I just hear myself saying "hello")I sent it back to Cingular, they exchanged it
##The new one had the same problems except
[t] good phone
##i do not own this phone but my best friend does and i use it alllll the time
##the big prb
camera[@]##is that she has a LOT of droped calls, i will be talking to her and then she will not be there!! It gets really anoying! We take pics of EVERYTHING, the camera is really good, does not have a light, witch is bad sometimes because u can not take pics in low light
##Allso if u move to fast after taking the pic it will show up dif
##,like when you are loking at it in the pic menu and then close up on it it is two dif
##pics
##My friend has had to take her phone to get fixed a lot because the pic ID was not working(it still is not working)
camera[@]##But besides the droped calls and the problems with the camera it is a great phone!!
[t] Phone is good until earpiece dies
##I have had this phone for about ~1 year
##Recently I have only barely been able to hear the person I am talking to on the phone
##At first I attributed this to maybe a bad connection, but then I found out a friend was having similar problems
internet[@]##I looked on the internet and found people were having similar problems
##This phone is WORTHLESS, it can have all the features in the world but if you cant hear the person you are talking to what is the point
##I recommend not buying this phone
##If you are looking to buy another motorola I would check to make sure that it doesnt have similar earpiece problems
[t] Price too high here, phone OK
##I really like my phone
##I've had it for nearly a year
##Well anyway, I've had 3 of them, that is
##The first one decided that it suddenly wanted to work on speakerphone only so the girls in the dorm nextdoor could hear my mom crystal clear
##So I called Cingular for a replacement and got it
##Wretched machine, it died when it said fully charged 2 days after I got it
##So I called them up yet again for another replacement
##The sales rep
##was rather bewildered but I did infact send it off
##In fact, as an apology of sorts, they sent it on priority mail with no extra charge to me, so I got it the next day rather than in a week and a half
service[@]##I'm hooked on Cingular's service and this new phone also has a year warranty for any manufacturing glitches
##That being said, this third one is working like a charm
##The reception is pretty good and I love the features
##Oooo, better yet, I realized that it also works in select areas of Mexico so when I go there with my church, Mom can call me w/o having to risk getting someone who doesn't speak English
##I bought this one for $30 after rebates at Best Buy
[t] Good features, but...
service[@]##Just got my phone back from service
screen[@]##The screen went dark
##I was told by the store that it was a common problem with this phone
##Otherwise it is a good phone
[t] Good Phone..Just A Few Minor Things
##I brought my phone October of last year from the Cingular website
##This is my very 1st flip phone & only reason I picked this phone was because it had really good features, its cute & it has mobile IM which is AIM & YIM
##I was happy it had both of those on this phone because I love chattin with my friends soo I could be on both even when I'm on the go
##However it has very bad reception
##I give it 4 stars tho because it does not work inside buildings you have to talk outside & thats something I hate, but they have antennas for that, that can boost up your reception which I brought soo now I have no problems I can talk on my phone in buildings soo really I have no complaints
camera[@]##Its a good phone has great volume & a good camera just gotta constantly keep the lens clean otherwise your pictures won't turn out clear
##I can't speak for others but I'm very pleased with my cell phone those are the only problems I had but I fixed it sooo overall I'm happy
[t] BEST PHONE FOR A 11 YEAR OLD
##THIS WAS THE BEST PHONE THAT I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY LAST WEEK
##MY PARENTS PAY HALF THE BILL AND I CAN CALL ANYONE I WANT
##I CAN CALL IN PA OR FL OR ANYWHERE THIS IS THE BEST PHONE TO GET IF YOU ARE 11-DEAD
##ITS SO EASY TO USE
[t] The V400
##This phone is great
##I would reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a phone
##I have Cingular and the coverage is great
##I have never had a problem with Cingular
##I have only lost coverage a few times in the middle of nowhere
##If you are looking for a phone this or the Motorola V220 with Cingular are the best ways to go in my opinion
[t] do NOT buy this phone
##I have had this phone for about 5 months now and I'm getting rid of it as soon as possible
service[@]##It drops calls when I have full service
##It randomly just won't ring when I have service, just beeps when someone leaves me a voicemail
service[@]##On a clear day, if I stand in the exact same spot the service will go from 5 bars to 0 bars and then back up to 5
##I have the media text messaging and that randomly won't work
battery[@]##After I've fully charged the battery I'll receive a 10 min
battery[@]##phone call and all of the sudden the battery will go dead
##My husband is on the same plan as I am and has a Nokia phone
service[@]##He has never had any problems, so we know that it's not the service
##My advice to you is not the buy this phone
##my husband has had 2 different Nokia phones in the past few years and has never had a problem with any of them
##I have had 2 Motorola phones and have had continuous problems with them
[t] Moto v400
##The motorola is Cingular's best offering (right now)
screen[@]##the phone has a very high resolution screen (176 by 220)
sound[@]##I love the sound quality and even speakerphone has good sound and the other party can hear me
ringtones[@][u]##The mp3  are fun, but often expensive
camera[@]##The camera resolution is normal ( VGA or 640 by 480 ) In general this is a solid phone that I would strongly recomend, please e-mail me with any questions, ( DrSmile2@aol
##com)
[t] So-so......so you might buy another phone instead
##First and utmost, let me tell you that the manual is total crap!It is the worst manual ever written in a product's history
##Now some good features SpeakerPhone
[t] Good graphics, lousy phone
##I share the concerns of others with this phone
screen[@]##I was very impressed with the picture screen
##It has vivid color and clarity, although it is worthless in bright light conditions
##It is also an attracive phone on the surface
##But, that's where it ends
##The phone starts up very slowly when going through its initial diagnostics
##The response time for the function buttons is also quite slow, even when dialing a phone number
##The side buttons are an absolute embarrasment when they go off in your pants or jacket
##They are also very useless
##The ringer is not loud enough
##The outside plastic lense covering the clock easily scratches if you get the phone near change or keys in your pocket
##Even blue jean material will scratch it easily
screen[@]##The picture screen also scratches easy and always holds your facial oils
##Finally, the function buttons are poorly lit to be useful in dark conditions
##Unfortunately, I ignored the naysayers on this phone when deciding to go ahead and purchase it
##They were right and I was wrong
##My friends and family made much better choices and I can't wait to replace this disaster
##Motorola
[t] Pissed off Cell User
##This phone was working okay until about 2 months after the warranty was off
##Just like a lot of reviewers on this list I too had problems with the buttons on the side changing my ring volume which caused me to miss some calls
##But that's not a really big deal
##All the bells and whistles work just fine
##I just can't HEAR ANYBODY TALKING!!!!!!!! I keep telling my mom that she needs to speak up
##Forget about hearing anything if you're outside or in a public place
##I swear I've pressed this phone to the side of my head so much trying to hear I think I've got a cell phone shaped ear
##Of course Cingular will not give me a new phone
##The constant dropped calls didn't help either
##But most of that stopped when I started my off-peak hours at 7 pm instead of 9 pm
##Cingular seems to work on their towers after 9pm and on weekends which makes for dropped calls
##So I have 4 months left on my contract and I'm seriously contemplating changing carriers after 11 years with the same company and they don't seem care that they're loosing my business
##The free phones worked great, the modestly prices phones worked great,but the one I paid good money for turns out to be a piece of caca!
[t] v400 is a good stable phone
camera[@]##This phone is excellent, especially for the price! The camera is very good, the best I have seen on a phone
##The reception is great too, while other Cingular phones have no service, my phone is still working
screen[@][u],battery[@]##The  is gorgeous! The only complaint is that the battery life is merely average
[t] Love / Hate relationship
##I too have had my V400 from Cingular for about 6 months
screen[@]##I absolutely love the features - the variety of menu options, the phone book, and especially the high resolution screen (it definitely has a "WOW" effect with an American flag as the background
##It's also extremely rugged, given that it's dropped to the sidewalk in the park multiple times
software[@]##What I don't like is the software that runs the phone
##Either it is extremely buggy or the phone's processor needs to be faster
##More often than not, disconnecting from a phone call will be delayed 2-3 seconds after hitting the "End" key
##The scroll rate through the phone book is extremely slow as well
battery[@]##Even though it is seldom, the phone "freezes" and nothing but taking out the battery solves the problem
[t] Pretty Good Phone
ringtones[@]##This is an ok phone, but needs to have more ringtones available, with a louder setting for use in noisy areas
##I signed up for the Family Talk plan through Cingular, and so far it's been ok
service[@]##I do have some issues with Cingular's customer service though
##In short, it stinks!(unless you're lucky enough to talk to someone who actually knows what they're doing)
##Overall, the phone itself serves its purpose pretty well
##One more thing
##I tried to speak to the manufacturer (Motorola) about some of the features--bad idea
##I was connected to someone in ARGENTINA!! Of course he was unable to help me
##SO, it was back to Cingular
ringtones[@]##No real issues with the phone except the ringtones and the volume
[t] Awesome Phone- Attractive
##This is a very attractice phone
##you know
##friends and family all wanting to check it out saying its cool and stuff
##you wouldnt find that in a nokia
##you know people would say oh well
##just another nokia (my opinion
##) No disrespect to nokia
##Some are Cool
##Back to the phone
##I dont know why people are complaining
camera[@],battery[@]##For me, battery life is great, i messed around with the camera taking pictures and deleting them for about 4 1/2 hours and not one link on the battery went down
##Amazon shipped this phone to me in 2 days with the free shipping
##Totally Awesome phone
##Nice color display
ringtones[@]##My only regret is to download ringtones (some you actually enjoy) cost $2
##50 to download one mp3 ringtone! thats crazy
##I would recommend this phone to anyone who has any doubts about buying it
[t] OKay
##This is a good phone, no joke
service[@]##I've been with Cingular for ages and completely love their service
##I must say thought that while the Nokia is much more unattractive, I did recieve better reception on it
##I love this phone though! The reception is ok
##But all the other features are completely incredible
##Battery life is great
##I charged my phone on Sunday and it lasted me until Wendnesday
##The phone looks classy and professional
screen[@]##And the blue display screen is nice as well
screen[@]##I like the internal display screen as well (very colorful and crisp)
price[@],camera[@]##This is the best camera phone on the market for this price
##The resolution ROCKS!! And the phone has a bunch of storage
ringtones[@]##My favorite features are the MP3 ringtones and the picture caller ID!! Over all I love the phone! If I gotjust a little better reception it would be perfect
[t] Worst phone I ever had
##I am a person who has gone through a lot of different cell phones through different servers
##I have never had a phone that sucked as much as the motorola v400
##I had this phone for 4 months before it started acting up
##My ear piece stopped working and I would constantly have to put people on speaker phone and expose my conversation to those around
##I called Cingular and they sent me the same phone
##Two months after having the phone guess what? Yeah the ear piece stopped working again
##And then my speaker phone started to have a volume control problem
##Sometimes it was loud and others it wasn't
screen[@]##The buttons stopped working, and the screen would go blank
##I am guessing that this phone is a real piece of crap because I called Cingular and they are sending me a different motorola because this one has been discontinued
##I swear, I will never buy a motorola cell phone again!
[t] Watch out for order problems
##Yeah the phone itself is ok, but the real problem with this whole offer is ordering through Amazon
##com, as noted by another review already
##I had a similar experience in which Amazon contacted me via email and explained that more info was needed to process the application
##so when you try to "Revise the order" the operation times out when attempting to contact Amazon servers
##In short, you can't update the order with whatever credit info that they claim is needed
##I contacted Cingular directly and was approved in about 2 minutes, and after placing another order with Amazon I actually got the phone
##But the other funny thing is, you can't cancel the original order because the operation keeps timing out when contacting Amazon's servers again
##So I emailed them and have gotten no response as of yet
##We'll see what happens on that, so caveat emptor for all ya'll
[t] breaks
##I've had two
##both have broken very quickly (one was a replacement)
##Stay away
[t] Nice phone but ...
screen[@]##I have had this phone for about a month and I really like it for all of its fun features but I find the screen hard to read
battery[@]##Maybe I need glasses but I can hardly see the battery strength in the right corner and I REALLY have a hard time reading the signal strength in the top left corner
##I do regret getting this phone but not because of the phone itself but for the coverage in my area
##The signal stinks in my area and probably 85% of the time when I go to use my phone I have no signal or I get the call failed message
[t] BE AWARE!!! The service plan is untrustworthy
service[@]##The phone is great, but order the service through Amazon is terrible
##I had a similar experience in which Amazon contacted me via email and explained that more info was needed to process the application
##, just like the other two reviewers, although the email from Amazon indicated that they had automatically canceled the order due to insufficient information
##They DID NOT refund my money to my credit card
##I have contacted Amazon but gotten no response yet
internet[@][u],service[@]##Be aware to order the service through Amazon, you might end up giving ALL your information through  for a credit check but get hassle in return
[t] Very Complicated Phone and Terrible Reception
##I have now had my V-400 for a year
##I still don't know how to use most features because they use a icon system that is not intuitive
##I have dropped calls all the time and most calls are garbled
##I would not buy this phone again
[t] Bad Phone
##my husband had not one, but two of these phones in less than a year and they were both lemons! The first one he had, the person on the other end could not hear you talking at all - it was like no one was there! The phone was brand new! He had it replaced with the same phone and this one you could not hear anything on it! He finally sent it back and just got a totally different brand of phone entirely
##I don't know if we just got two bad phones or if this phone is just not a good phone
##Either way, we'll never have another one!!!
[t] BAD BAD Customer service, trying to rip you off!!!
##I wanted to switch my provider from ATT and still keep my number so here's what i did
[t] business manager
##great cellular
##photos are pretty good and signal easy to manages
[t] Cingular service is deceptive
##My review is on Cingular
##I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used
##THEY LIE
##THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY
##THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area
##If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular
##Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse
[t] EH
##I LOVE THE PHONE
##BUT EVERY GOOD PHONE HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS
##( I JUST HAVENT FOUND THE DOWNS YET )
[t] Good phone with some problems
##This was my first flip phone, so I can not really compare with other flip phones, but after having this phone for a pretty long time I can not say I am unhappy with it
screen[@]##Has one of the best screen resolutions and most vivid color (especially compared to some top selling non motorolla bluetooth phones)
##Very sturdy body (I have dropped it numerous times, including once from the second floor
##Have some scratches, but works perfectly)
##Great reception (even when you remove the external antenna)
##I have used the phone in multiple countries
##Since this phone comes unlocked, one just needs to change the SIM
##Now about the drawbacks
battery[@]##One is of course the constant beeps when the battery runs down - even on vibration mode
##Second is the position and functionality of the side buttons
##And it is not very easy to open/close the phone with one hand, although after some practice, it can be done
[t] Motorola V400
##The Motorola V400 is a phone that combines both elegance and business into a simple easy to use device
camera[@][u]##The v400 comines with a spacious color display and VGA 
##It takes high quality photographs that you can send to friends or family or assign to a picture to a person so that when they call, their picture appears
##With mp3 ringtones, a built in song mixer, and Multimedia Messaging the v400 is the perfect phone for any person
[t] Great phone...
##I love this phone
##you can hack the heck out of it by reading up at howardforums
##com and change the volume settings and remove any restrictions put on by your wireless carrier
##Cables are available on ebay for less than a dollar in most cases
##It's got great reception, great features
##I even like the weight and size, as its not the type of phone you see in the movie Zoolander
##Good stuff all around
[t] Consider it carefully
##I have owned this phone for about 6 months now and am ditching it
##Before this phone I was a strong believer in Samsung phones, and now, I am even more
##By far, the worst part about this phone is not the physical quality of it, which is fairly good, but rather the digital part, which is total crap
software[@][u]##The  is buggy and unreliable
##It is slow and clunky
battery[@]##I can't tell you how many times I've had to remove the battery just to end a call
##Sometimes it refuses to dial out, and other times it just won't do anything at all
##It is not reliable and truthfully, it is not trust worthy
##There are several nice things about it though
screen[@]##The screen is very nice, big, bright, and sharp
##It also has a speakerphone that works well and a built in e-mail client (which I will miss)
##In the end, after 6 months, today I ordered the Samsung SGH-E317 and though it lacks the high resolution screen, email client, and speakerphone, it should be a phone I can trust
##What's the point of having a phone if you can't trust that it will be there when you really need it?
[t] Worst piece of junk I ever bought..... Save your money
##I'm tired of reading revues from people who just got a brand new cell phone and have absolutely no depth of history with the product
##I purchased my V400 july 2004 and at first (for about 2 month) had no big problems the phone didn't strike me or the people i was talking with to have any great audio quality but it was usable
##Then I was constantly trying to max out my volume since i couldn't hear what people where saying to me, most of the time i was rushing to a land line and called them back (great way to do business)
##Then the phone started to become unusable
##People calling me couldn't hear me or i couldn't hear them
##Sound distorted
camera[@]##The games worked ok and so did the camera
##But lets be honest here give a phone that works first then ad the gimicks
##I received consecutivelly 2 new phones in exchange of my original one
##All of them did the same thing fine for 3-4 weeks and then hell broke loose
##After 1 year of Hell and dropping from using 700min/month on my account to 150
##I finally got another model
##I hope my new Motorola V600 works or this will be the last Motorola phone I ever own
[t] Overall Good Phone
##I've had the phone for almost a year, and it's not bad at all
camera[@]##The camera works well, and all the features are great
##However, my biggest complaint (and why I'm in the market for a new phone) is the volume! The volume of the ringwer (even on loud) and especailly the volume of the speaker during the calls is HORRIBLE
##It's really hard to hear people you're speaking to and hearing incoming calls
##The speaker phone works wonders for this
##except calls you don't want broadcast to everyone, and you can't connect the speaker until after the call's been connected
##So overall not a bad phone, but I've gotten to the point where I can't deal with it
##Hope this helped
[t] An amazing mobile phone!
##I have just recently started using all of the features of this phone
##I was tempted to get one after I saw my friend's V300 with T-Mobile
##I have AT&T Service and this phone was only unlocked to Cingular Wireless so when i bought it (second hand) it had to be unlocked by a 3rd party company for $25
##Other than that, this phone has been amazing
##The data cable is great for getting MP3 ringtones, keeping up with my Outlook data and also sending pictures I take to my computer
camera[@]##All of the memory on this phone is great for storing pictures (the camera has great quality) as well as MP3 files, contacts and Microsoft Outlook calandar data
##I highly reccomend this phone!
[t] Great Phone
##Have had this phone for about 1 month
##The reception is very good
camera[@]##The built in camera works great
##Overall it's a very well made product that is easy to use
##Have had 3 other Motorola phones in the past and all have been well made and have never failed even with a lot of abuse
##Made the mistake of buying a Samsung last time and was not happy with its performance or quality
##Glad to return to this great phone!
[t] Good Looks and Specs - WORKS POORLY in REAL LIFE! AVOID
##I was looking for a quad-band GSM phone that I could use anywhere in the world (OK, most places)
camera[@][u]##Though I was not particularly interested in the  functionality, I chose this phone as it was the one which seemed to have the specs I needed
##But within a short time, my perception of this phone degenerated into the realization that the actual usability and performance of this phone leaves a lot to be desired (and gives you repeated opportunities to improve your inner self by curbing your irritation at things that don't deliver as promised
[t] webmerch
##1- The worst manual(documentation) i have ever seen for a cell phone2- Side-mounted buttons that make it difficult to so much as pick up the phone without inadvertently activating something3- Gave it to my kids as a toy since this is absolutley garbage
##No wonder you make money by choosing this phone(Rebate)!4- I can not believe Motorola makes junk these days!
[t] Don't get this phone if you use voice dialing!
##I don't like this phone
##It's too small to use, even with the programmable buttons I can't get it to work the way I want
##And the voice dialing feature is terrible
##Either it won't save the name when you try to set it up or it can't find it when you try and use it
##Also very slow to actually dial the number when it does work
##I've returned the phone to Cingular thinking it was just a faulty phone, the next one worked for a few days and then started screwing up too
##Can't return any more to Cingular, so went to Motorola
##Their solution was to reset the phone, which removed all the programming, but did make the voice dialing work for 5 minutes
camera[@]##The I found you just had to turn the phone on and off to get it to work, but that's not really a solution now, is it?And it's not just my phone that does this, my kid's phone, my husband's phone and at least one other teen we know with this phone have the same problem!!!Phone also comes with practically no ringtones, no games,On the plus side, the camera and speakerphone are good
##I was impressed with how good the pictures turn out after you send them to a PC
[t] Decent Phone Poor Design
##I didn't like the UI on the phone too much
camera[@]##The pictures from the camera aren't very much to look at
screen[@]##The worst part however is that the LCD screen is very easily broken
##Mine lasted 3 months before I broke mine, and it costs 135 to replace -- almost the same cost as a new phone
##Not Recommended
[t] V220,,,,,,Good & tough phone
##We've had our V220 phones for nearly 2 years & they have proved to be very dependable & quite tough as well! I've dropped mine more times than i can count on my concrete porch, out of my truck, kicked it into a curb once & it still works well
##Call quality is good
##Signal is weak sometimes but I blame that on conditions & my network
screen[@]##(Cingular) I have experienced the screen going blank once, but i took the SIM card out for a minute or so then reinserted it & things were fine
##I also had a problem with the headset connection once,(wouldn't connect) but that ended up being the end of the plug on the handsfree broke of in the phone
##Not the phones fault
camera[@]##As far as the camera goes,,,It's a phone!! if you want high quality photos, get a digital camera
##That being said, it can take decent pics
##Overall, these have been great phones for my wife & myself
[t] Not too Shabby
##I have had this phone for quite some time and it was a huge upgrade from my LG phone
ringtones[@]##If you purchase this phone, purchasing the Motorola Phone Tools is a necessity so you dont have to pay for ringtones and such
##I have found that the phone is rather simple to use (for me anyways) and the picture quality is rather standard but is sufficient for a phone
##I have had problems getting the voice dialing to work but then again I did not read the manual
##The only problem I have had with this phone is the "chrome" finish seemed to wear off pretty quick but I use my phone quite extensively and have to switch the ringer volume up and down a lot depending upon what I am doing in the office (nothing like Highway to Hell blaring during a conference call)
##All in all I am pleased with this phone although it is not the "in" phone to have, it has all the features I really need
[t] Terrible phone
camera[@]##The camera quality is bad, and after a few months the ear piece of the phone became unsturdy and flimsy (it would squeek while talking) and people constantly complained that I never came through clearly
screen[@]##I really reccomend passing over this phone- though the interface is easy to use and the screen is visible in the front, it is still the worst phone ever
[t] Very disappointed
##Ready to buy a new phone but did manage to keep this for the year contract without having to return it
##The camera, though, is awful and the picture quality is rubbish
##The phone scratches easily and sometimes I do not receive calls and am told I have missed calls days later
##I also sometimes have problems hearing the ringer and the vibration is not strong
[t] Worst Phone EVER!!!
##I have not had this phone for a year and I am already on my fourth phone
##The speaker goes out often and you cannot hear anyone unless you play with it
screen[@]##The screen shuts off all the time and I randomly get missed phone calls a day after they happened
camera[@]##The camera is poor quality and usually goes blank anyone so it is totally pointless
##It always changes volume
##I do not recommend this phone to anyone, very poor quality
[t] Great except for...
##Bad things first
[t] Not very loud
##First things first
##For those of you that don't know already, the phone book can hold multiple numbers for one entry without creating multiple entries
##You just have to set the phone book to view primary contacts instead of all contacts
##That will solve the problem of having multiple entries displayed
##Secondly, yes the Motorola menu system is not very intuitive and confusing for anyone not familiar with a Motorola cell phone, but it is very powerful, with a lot of options that many other cellphone manufacturers fail to include
##Especially since this is a very cheap cell phone
price[@]##How many cell phones include the type of features in this price range?Well now that that's out of the way we can discuss the more important details of this phone
##The one thing that bothers me about this phone, and the one that ultimately led me to returning it, is the fact that the earpiece volume is not very loud
##I use my phone in a lot of crowded places, and the fact that I have to ask everyone to repeat theirself when talking to me is annoying
##My Sony Ericsson candy bar style phone has a much better earpiece
##The display is not terribly impressive, but that's to be expected, they had to cut costs somewhere
##It is usable in every sense
screen[@]##The screen is somewhat small, but very adequate
screen[@],camera[@][u]##The  is VGA quality, and the screen cannot reproduce the sort of detail you would like, but just send it to your computer, and it looks just as good as any cellphone with a VGA 
##The reception quality is good, better than the Sony Ericsson I have
##I can receive a signal where even my Sony can't
##Of course, Cingular's network is very extensive
##The only problem, like I mentioned before, is that the earpiece volume is not very loud
##That is its' greatest flaw, as what else is the main purpose of your cell phone but listening and talking on it
[t] Hmmmmmmmmmm.................
##THIS PHONE IS OK
##NOT THE BEST OUT THERE, BUT DECENT
##DONT GET IT FOR THE CAMERA THOUGH
##ITS VERY LIGHT AND FEELS LIKE A TOY
##ITS GOOD FOR THE PRICE THOUGH
##THIS IS NOT ONE OF MOTOROLLAS BETTER PHONES, BUT I THINK ITS PRETTY GOOD BECASUE OF THE SPEAKER PHONE
##AND THE SIGNAL IS MUCH BETTER THAN T-MOBILE!!!!!
[t] Motorola makes the best cell phones
##I have had several types and brands of cell phones
##Some examples are Nokia, Samsung, Audiovox, Kyocera
##I've used calling plans and pre paid
##I purchased this phone from Cingular about a week ago and I definitely think it is the best I have owned
##The phone is incredibly easy to use and I love that the quick keys on the phone can be set up as shortcuts to certain parts of the menu
##I have mine set up where the right soft key is Address Book and the left soft key is Recent Calls
##I have my menu settings hidden on the wallpaper but they are easily accessed by hitting the keys the arrow keys
##You can also assign what icons come up and their locations can be rearranged
screen[@],button[@]##Then access the basic menu screen itself you can hit the Quick Task button in the top middle on the round button inbetween the arrows
camera[@]##The camera is easy to use and is easily accessed in a number of ways
##Easiest is the smart key on the side of the phone underneath the two volume buttons
screen[@]##I think the pics have good resolution and the color screen and graphics of the phone are awesome
camera[@]##I love taking pictures with the camera and using them as wallpaper or screensavers
##The phone book is easy to use
##You can save entries to the SIM card or to the phone itself
ringtones[@]##I recommend saving to the phone because then you can personalize the ringtones for the callers and add a picture to identify the caller
##The speakerphone is excellent quality and easy to use
sound[@][u],ringtones[@][u]##You can download  that are actual songs and  great
##I don't understand how anyone can say this phone is hard to use
##The Samsung I had was difficult to use and I had it for a good while and still wasn't sure how to do certain things
##With this phone I was pretty sure how to do things with it from the get go but I quickly glanced over the manual to be exact and from there I have not had to look at it again
##This phone is the easiest but the most satisfactory all around that I have ever used or owned
##I am definitely a convert to Motorola from now on and I am terrificly pleased with this phone
[t] This phone SUCKS and so does Cingular!!
##I've had my phone for 4 months now and have had nothing but trouble with it
##The reception is terrible
##where I used to receive calls with my AT&T; plan and my cheap little NOKIA, I cannot get with this phone and the company that is "raising the bar!" I am constantly losing calls and get bad or distorted reception (if any at all) under electrical lines, around appliances, etc
##If I could go back, I would, but my whole family switched at the same time
##When my contract is up, I'm dumping the phone and the company and not looking back!
[t] two days of battery life and impossible to download pictures
##So far the phone works, but there are two major dissapointments
[t] Won't turn on!!!!
##This thing, I am seriously fed up with it
##I don't know what the deal is but every few days I go to turn this phone on and it won't! It will flash and then go off
button[@][u]##I seriously spent about SEVEN minutes this morning contstantly pressing the power  again and again and again until FINALLY it turned on
##I do not recommend this phone, whatever deal you're getting it's not worth it to spend minutes a few times a week getting the thing to turn on
##The phone I had several phones ago might be a dinosaur now but at least it was reliable
[t] Great all around phone
##This is what most people like to say as the most bang for the buck i love this phone and i will keep it until my contract is up
##I had a Razr phone and found this one to be alot better as in it last longer and is stronger also its so cheap you dont care if you break it
camera[@]##The camera is good and it has a very strong signal all the time
##Great speaker phone for when your in the car or just dont want it by your ear
##Highly recommended
[t] Great Phone
##I've owned just about every brand of cell phone you can imagine
##I found that the V220 is a tremendous bang for the buck
##Don't get me wrong, I am not saying this phone is perfect
price[@]##It does have it flaws, but the amount of features you get for the price can't be beat
##Pros
[t] DON'T BUY THIS PHONE. AMEN!
##I have had this phone one year and two months, with a one year warranty
##It was great until the warranty expired
service[@]##I have excellent service with Cingular, but the phone is BAD! I've also heard other people (3) say they had problems with their V220 also
camera[@]##First, the camera went out
screen[@]##Then two weeks later, I started seeing horizontal lines across my inside screen
screen[@]##The outside ID still works, but NOW, the inside screen is either, black or white OR multi-color with so many horizontal lines, that I cannot function anymore
##I can't access my address book and not all info is on my SIM card
##guess I've lost some valuable information
##I've been a faithful Motorola customer for 5 years
##I'm considering going to Sony
[t] DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!
##We ordered these phones from Cingular
##They are absolute junk
##My husband had to have his replaced 3 times and I had mine replaced twice
camera[@]##The camera would always mess up and would stay on or freeze up and you couldn't get into your phone book or even see who's calling on the caller i
##d
screen[@]##screen
##I've taken mine into a store to replace it and was told that the store didn't carry them because of all the issues with them
##These are not worth the money
##I had to replace mine again last week
##This time I went with a Sony Ericsson Z520A Its much better and has way more options
camera[@]##The camera even has a 4x digital zoom
##Don't buy this phone, or you will surely end up in the same boat that we did
[t] VERY VERY NICE PHONE!
##All of you people who say that this phone didn't charge after you got it, my phone charged over-night and was ready to use
##It fits anywhere I want to fit it! You have to buy the games, but it's worth it! It didn't break at all so far and I've had it for 2 years
##The face plate in changable, which is very cool
##I have not incountered any problems WHATSOEVER with this phone
##Although the buttons and a bit confusing, you'll get used to it after a couple of days
##Overall it's a great phone, it's compact, and sturdy
[t] Great phone! Until it starts messing up...
camera[@]##I had this phone for nearly a year with no problems, aside from the camera inexplicably stopping working
battery[@]##A few months ago the battery on the phone started draining within 8 hours of being fully charged
##I sent for a replacement and within a few weeks it started doing it again, but this time it shuts off randomly
battery[@]##My brother got the same phone as me and within six months his battery was being constantly drained
##He also sent for a replacement, which has worked until recently, when he started having problems with not being heard on the other end
##All in all, this phone isn't worth the trouble
##It will work great for awhile, then it won't, and depending on your provider, you'll be stuck with a crap phone and another year on your contract
[t] Terrible User Interface
##The user interface for this phone is among the worst I've ever seen -- for any device
##A herd of monkeys could do a better job than Motorola did with this phone
##The biggest complaint I have is that the buttons on the outside of the phone cause it to beep at full volume even when it is closed
design[@]##This terrible design has plagued Motorola's phones for years
##There is absolutely no reason the buttons on the outside of the phone should make noise when it is closed
##If the phone is closed and in your pocket or on your belt and the buttons get bumped for whatever reason, your phone beeps at full volume
##It's fine for the external buttons to do something (i
##e
##display the time, activate the backlighting, etc), but not to cause the phone to make noise
##When you press (or accidentally bump) the outside buttons when the phone is closed, the display toggles between displaying the time and the ringer volume
##On the first press, the ringer volume is displayed (i
##e
##"Style
[t] ideal for me
##i think this phone is really great,its sleek and compact,just the way i want my phone to be,it serves all my needs,im not really a phone person but my wife got this for me,a change from my samsung x427,however she went thru a lot with cingular customer service,i think they have the worst CS ever,they where totally cluless about how to migrate us from att to cingular,they advertise phones and dont have them in stock,it just sits down there on back order and nothin is done,the retail stores r not a great help to,one guy just gave us an extension and told us to call cingular CS and sort the matter with them,imagine AT A RETAIL STORE,i had just about given up but my wife was very persistent,after been on the phone for 6 days none stop,eventually some nice gurl,about the only person in cingular who knows wats shes doing,finally helped us out,and shipped out the phones,it was tasking believe me,but well here i am now with my phone,sometimes i think was it really worth it? well looking at it now i can say YEP!!!!
[t] Just hope your phone never quits working
battery[@]##I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off
##The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem
service[@]##After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable "due to customer abuse
##" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as "customer abuse"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation
##It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty
##You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works
##After that, you're on your own
[t] This phone sucks
screen[@]##This phone is absolutely horrible!!!!The screen fades out at will and comes on when it so desires as if it were a temperamental female
##Half the time I cannot talk to people unless it is on speakerphone because the mouthpiece goes out
##It does not standby for a long time either
##I hate it and would not wish this phone on my worst enemy
[t] Terrible phone!
##I bought three of these phones for my kids in December
##It is now August and they have all broken
screen[@]##Two have screen damage and one has an antenna stripped
##Also, the silver on the outside has rubbed off just from being taken in and out of a pocket
##I was told the phone is still under warranty, but that if we return it and they find the damage is caused by the user, they will charge $150 for the replacement phone
##Well, no phone is going to break if you put it on the shelf and leave it there
screen[@]##No cell phone should break from flipping a flip phone shut (as in screen damage) or from being taken in and out of a pocket
##I didn't want to take even the remotest chance of having to pay even a cent for another of these awful phones, so I bought new phones
##Go for Motorola V551 instead
##That is a much better phone
[t] DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!
##I have four motorola phones, two V220's and two V180's (same as V220 but without camera)
##After the warranty expired on these phones the troubles began
##My daugher's V220 began shutting off for no reason within a few seconds of being turned on
battery[@]##Replacing the battery did not help
##thinking this was just an anomaly, I decided to replace it with another V220, even though it meant extending the Cingular contract
screen[@]##Everything was OK for a while, then the main screen on my other daughter's V220 began going blank for no reason
##You could still make and receive calls but it was next to impossible to use any other functionality
##Next my wife's V180 would no longer ring
##I had to set the audio option to 'vibrate' in order to have a chance to detect an incoming call
screen[@]##Now, the main screen on my V180 phone has been periodically going blank
screen[@],internet[@]##I recently searched the internet for reviews on these phones and found numerous complaints similar to my blank screen problem
##Needless to say, this experience has destroyed my faith in Motorola products
##I will NEVER purchase another Motorola cell phone again, and I plan to strongly recommend against them for any of my associates who are in the market for a phone
[t] Waste of money
##This phone is a piece of JUNK!!!!!My daughter has this phone & it has been nothing but TROUBLE from the beginning
##We have had to send it back in & have a replacement sent to us 3 times in less than a year
camera[@]##The camera stops working, the address book deletes itself, calls are dropped for no reason, her voicemail stopped working, all reception has been lost both inside & outside
##WHAT A JOKE
##Motorola & Cingular should be ashamed of themselves!
[t] V220 freezes for no reason
##It worked 2 days after I purchased it and Freezed for no reason
##Removing SIM made it start the first time
##Next time when I switched it off in church, it never came back
battery[@]##Tried removing battery /sim etc and thought it must be battery charge and charged for a whole day
##But nope
##Got to take it back to Cingular this weekend
##-Alex
[t] I hate this phone
##I switched from another cellular provider in December and I knew it was a mistake
##I was trying to save a buck - big mistake
service[@]##I'm not a big fan of Cingular and I can't tell which is worse, their service or this phone
##I can barely hear out of the phone and forget it if you have the windows down in the car
##The ringer is easily drowned out, even at its highest setting
##And when I go to my mother's house, which is 10 min from mine, I can't use it all
##The address book is set up weird; for each entry there's a separate line which is dumb
##And on most phones, you can personalize the screen, not this one
##I guess I was spoiled by my previous cell provider
##The free phones I got from them were way better than this one, and I paid for this one
service[@]##I have about 18 mos left and then it's back to my old cell service
[t] Pretty Good Phone
##This is a decent phone, but not worth as much as it costs
screen[@],camera[@]##It has a color screen and camera but both are pointless
screen[@]##The screen is so small it is almost unusable, and the pictures turn out blurry and washed out
##Other than that it is a good phone
##I would not recommend it
[t] v220 lack alot
##I have always had a motorola cell phone but the v220 is a big let down
##It looks, feels, and operates like a cheap phone
[t] A little workhorse
##We were moving to the greater Seattle area so we purchased a couple of V220 cell phones
##They have proven to be little workhorses, but if I had to do it again, I would have up graded for better phones
price[@]##Don't get me wrong, we have no complaints for the price we paid for them
##But we simply underestimated how much we were going to use our phones, and being relatively new to cell phones, we did not know what to look for in a new phone
##A pleasant surprise was the calendar
##I was able to program in my appointments and as a result, rarely missed an appointment
##On the downside, we are a little disappointed in its ability to receive signal
##The picture option is great, but the quality of its pictures when compared to upgraded models is very poor
##By the way, email me if you have figured out a way to download your pictures to your PC
battery[@]##I had no complaints about battery life (two days on a single charge), until I had to use it for my business (resulting in using 2000 minutes a month) I have to recharge my phone midday
##Other salesmen using upgraded phones go all day on a single charge
##Would I buy this phone again, probably not
##But it does make a good kids phone
##So if you got some teens or preteens that are begging for a cell phone, this is the phone for them
##As for me, I will probably upgrade very soon
[t] A so-so phone
##I think David Estalote is overreacting a little bit
##You can easily change the ringer volume on the outside of the phone very quietly
##Now turning the ringer back on is quite a bit loud
##Here is my impression of this phone (I have had it for a month)
[t] V220 Good or Bad? Cingular?
##The V220 is a great phone
screen[@],camera[@]##With a camera it makes up for the small colour screen
##By the way read the return policy on www
##cingular
##com, if you cancle withen three (3) days you get all the activation fees that you paid back
##So the phone and the provider are great
##For the low cost go for it
ringtones[@][u]##PS- MP3  are great!
[t] I love this phone!
##This phone is great!
##it's compact, feels solid, and has great reception
screen[@]##Yes, the screen is SLIGHTLY smaller that a few other phones but if you want a phone to actually make and receive calls, this is a great phone
##What I especially appreciate about this phone is the volume in loud areas
battery[@]##I got rid of my previous phone, an LG brand phone, because its battery did not hold a charge, it often made me restart it before I could make a call after exiting a building, and because it had low volume
##The Motorola phone is plenty loud and has great reception
##Some people complained about the lack of included ring tones
##Well, that's a valid complaint, but ALL Motorola phones are like that
##spend the $1
##99 to buy the ring tone you really want from Cingular - big deal
##If you want a phone to perform as a phone, then get this one
[t] Buyer Beware!
##The camera's zoom features went out after 2 months
camera[@]##Now, 18 months later the camera no longer works, but I didn't use it all that much to begin with
##The reception is pretty lousy and I had the typical commerical ad happen to me when during the WORST time it could happen, it went completely DEAD! As of now, I can call manually and receive calls but heaven forbid it goes into voicemail
screen[@],battery[@]##The battery won't stay charged,the screen won't work (I get nothing but transposed gibberish)and I can't retrieve any info
##I thank God my contract will be up soon
##This phone is a piece of JUNK
##PHOOEY!
[t] JUNK!!!
##Do NOT by this phone
##One of the worst
camera[@][u]##Freezes up, the  does not work
##BAD SERVICE
[t] This is not a phone that I would ever buy again.
##I have had this phone a little over a year
##I live in rural Missouri and have had a hard time getting any technology where we live
##This phone has been okay for me
##Not a great phone, but just okay
##I really am looking forward to upgrading to a new phone
##But like I said, I would never recommend this phone or ever buy it for myself, again
##Pros
[t] Absolutely Positively junk
##All the bad reviews here are true
##I had my phone replaced in Nov because of the display problem and now 3 months later in February it is out again
##This time it is out of warranty
##I also have a Motorola smart phone Mpx220 that I had to get replaced 3 times during the 1 year warranty
##I don't have much hope for the second year of my contract
##Funny how these cell phone contracts are so one sided
##Stay away from the MOTOROLA name completely for your best guarantee of satisfaction
[t] Almost Worthless Piece of Junk
##I've had this model of phone for a little over six months and I am now on my FOURTH phone
##The first one lasted about a month before the external display completely quit working
##On the replacement phone they sent me (phone# 2) the keypad wouldn't light up at all
##So, I immediately got a replacement sent to me (phone #3) and the keypad would only light up from time to time
##It was able to make and receive calls so I decided to just put up with it
##The phone worked well enough for about three months (a record for these phones I'm sure) and then it suddenly stopped being able to make or receive calls
##After I was able to convince Cingular that, yes, there was something wrong with my phone they sent me a replacement phone (phone #4) which I've had for about a month now
##I just noticed yesterday that the external display is starting to not work from time to time
##I'm sure that I'll be on phone# 5 within a few weeks
##If there is any possible way you can avoid getting one of these phones, please do! They are absolute pieces of junk
[t] Screen Problem......
screen[@][u]##Just like many have already stated, my  died after six months
##Stay Away!!! Trying to get a replacement, and hopefully this one will work
[t] DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!
screen[@],camera[@]##My problems all started when the camera stopped working and then the antenna fell out and the screen went black, all right when the warranty expired
[t] Solid phone
##I got this phone off eBay for about 80 bucks after I lost my V551
##You know what? Bluetooth aside, I like this phone better than the V551! Why? It has almost all the same functions I want but in a noticeably smaller package-- speakerphone, VGA camera, flip, external caller ID, standard earbud jack
##The V551 was a bit bulky for me-- keeping it in my shirt pocket even for a little bit was uncomfortable
size[@][u]##The V220 isn't the smallest of the bunch but it's a good balance of features, price, and 
battery[@]##The battery life is better than the V551
##Unfortunately it doesn't use the same kind of charger (I still have the charger for the V551 I lost)
##And the pictures aren't quite as good
##As I said, it does not have Bluetooth, which was a feature on the V551 I was quite excited about, even though I'm too cheap to buy a bluetooth headset
##But the V220 does have a USB jack that accepts a somewhat-standard "mini-USB" cord that has standard USB on the other end
software[@]##If you buy the Motorola software for 50 bucks or however much it is, you can do all that same stuff as if you had Bluetooth-- ringtones, use it as a modem (maybe), offload your pictures, etc
##Menu system is pretty good, but I don't like that it doesn't just store missed calls, dialed calls, etc
##in exact sequence-- if the same person calls twice, it only saves the date of the most recent call
##Overall a good phone if you can get it cheap (or free)
[t] Good for free
##I got this phone free through an offer by Cingular
##I've never had any real problems with this phone
camera[@]##I always wanted a camera phone and this does exactly what I need it to do
##The phone felt light and flemsy so I bought a cover for it, and it feels a lot more solid now
##It's been dropped almost every other day since I bought it four months ago and it's still going strong
##The only things I don't like about this phone are that it doesn't have a very good memory and the external speaker could be louder; however, if I know I'm going to be in a loud area, the standard "continental" ringtone does the trick fine
##My reception almost always shows 2-3 bars, but it sounds just as good as 5 bars anyway
##I do have some dropped calls in the break room at my work and in the middle of nowhere
##I must admit that I can't wait until I'm eligible for a phone upgrade because there's so many better phones out there
##I mostly want one that has *a lot* more memory and that can capture video, not to mention one with a louder speaker
##As an entry level phone, I think it goes up and above the call of duty
[t] Ok I guess
camera[@]##I've had this phone for about 3 months, i got it because it was the only one with a camera that was free
software[@]##I hate the fact that you have to buy extra software to get the pictures into your computer, the cable alone wont help, I have a cable from my palm, I plugged it, and my computer recognized it but that was about it
ringtones[@]##It has very few ringtones and even fewer games, you have to buy everthing separate
##Aside from that, reception is good, although I have had a few dropped calls
##The menu is kind of hard to get used to after having used a Nokia for so long
[t] Don't bother with the V220
##My roommate and I bought the same plan from cingular three months ago, but we got different phones - she chose a Samsung phone and I chose the Motorola V220
##The biggest problem I have with my phone is that it doesn't like to ring when I'm getting a call, and even when it does ring it doesn't ring long enough for me to answer
##I always end up having to call the person back
##Also, the V220 often has a very weak signal in places where my roommate's phone will have a full signal, and I frequently have calls dropped
##This is my first motorola
##and most likely my last
##Don't bother buying the V220
[t] Terrible in so many ways.
##I recieved this phone for 50 bucks with a 2 year contract and wow this is just terrible
##I'll start with the few pros, there is a good deal of features but nothing that lg or samsung phones don't have
camera[@]##Now the cons, the camera is fuzzy overall bad, there is a very low amount of memory
##usb driver costs a whopping 50 dollars from cingular, so transferring the pics is a big wallet drainer
battery[@]##The battery meter is terrible, it indicates 4 bars out of 4 then goes 1 hour later to one bar
##It completely defeats the purpose of having a meter
##U can't record ur voice and use it as a ringtone
##Coverage is terrible on Cingular's gsm network, number of dropped calls is amazing with this phone
##(I live in CT) Now for the worst part of this phone that should make u not buy this, whenever there is a ring, data exchange of any kind, the phone creates extreme disturbance with nearby electronic devices
##Particularly speakers, if you like music, forfeit this phone, the crackling increases the amp volume and eventually kills your speakers
##My brand new harmon kardon speakers for example, were victims of this, now the right tweeter continues to make a constant crackling sound, Not only is this phone terrible as phone, it manages to ruin the speakers of my house
##I had to unplug my intercom system because of this thing
sound[@][u]##The crackling  is a very annoying high pitch problem
##Even if your volume is set low, it manages to increase the amp volume
##At this point, I don't even know if this is legal for a cell phone
##If u get this phone, get a lawyer while ur at it
[t] NICe...NICe...NICe
##it works great for me so far, and i have no complaints about it
##trust me guys i've had a phone for the last 5 yirs
##this works great me, and I highly recommend this
##dont bother the people below bcoz it depends on the person who uses it
battery[@]##battery life = greatpictures = averagesignal = goodinternet = dnt bother, this is expensive
##i'm satisfied with this phone
[t] Decent.
##I like this phone
##It is a huge step up from my last one, I got it for a good price, and it has many new functions that I don't know how I got along without
##I like how you can change your ringtone so easily (from silent to loud or vibrate to vibrate and then ring and so on) without even opening the phone
sound[@]##However, those buttons can also get pressed a lot accidentally creating an obnoxious beeping sound
##The phone does hold a long charge and I no longer have to put it on the charger every night like my old phone
service[@]##Sometimes my service is not so good but I can only speak for my area (Baltimore) because when I was elsewhere (SC) the reception was perfect (figures)
##If you're looking for a decent phone that can do a lot, including take pictures, for a good price, this phone is the way to go
[t] A Great Phone for a 12 year old
##I am 12 years old and have had this phone for about a month
##A lot of my friends have had it, even one who has broken 3 phones (none were this one) and has had this one for about a year and it still works fine
##I think it is very easy to use
##All my friends love it
screen[@]##The screen is a little small, but thats understandable
##All the functions are very easy to use
##I got it as a GoPhone after begging for a phone from my parents
##My mom found it very easy to, when i was at camp get on my computer type in my password on cingular
##com and add more minutes
##I have had no problems whatsoever with this phone and i recomend it to teens
##And also to parents of teens
[t] so far so good
##I got this phone only about two weeks ago and so far I'm pretty impressed
screen[@]##The screen is slightly smaller than my previous phone (Samsung x427) but the memory capacity more than makes up for it
##I ditched the Samsung because it quickly ran out of memory but I've downloaded a ton of stuff on the Motorola and all of it plays fine
##Anyways, here are some pros and cons
[t] Overkill...
##I got this phone becuase it was free with an upgrade
##I had read reviews and thought it would be worth the money (none) to upgrade to it
##It's a good phone
battery[@]##I've had it two days and the battery is still going strong
battery[@]##they say it takes a few rechargings to get the full potential out of the battery
##On the plus side
[t] Affordable item!! But no Motorola Support. =o(
##This is a great phone for those on a budget (like me!) It's one step down from the v400
##So if you can afford it, get the v400 instead! The v400 has a ton of included themes and photos, and more memory (5 MBs) compared to this phone, which is sort of "bare bones" (1
##8mb)
screen[@],camera[@]##Both have the same quality camera and photos, although the v400 has a better screen
##Both phones can have
ringtones[@]##mp3's playing as ringtones
screen[@],sound[@],battery[@]##The v220 has very clear sound quality, great screen and excellent battery life
##My only problem with it is that there is NO SUPPORT from motorola for a data link cable
software[@]##The V220 connects via a small USB plug, but you have to order the datalink software & drivers from motorola before you can use it (another fourty bucks! And Cingular didn't stock it, only Motorola does, on a very remote part of their site)
software[@]##I got my software on a file-sharing program because I've NEVER heard of a company charging money just for DRIVERS!!All-in-all I'm loving my new phone (I've had it for several weeks)
##I've been able to get rid of my palm pilot because it holds 1,250 contacts (with the Simm Card)
##One note - if you add your contacts to the phone's memory (as opposed to the Simm's) you will have to set the ringer for each contact or else it defaults to no ring)
software[@][u]##The motorola  also allows you to sync to your Microsoft Outlook contacts and calendar, and it was truly easy to use!This phone is a great way to feel like you've got tons of money, because it's basically just a "baby" version of the v400 (which retails for about $150 more usually)
##It's a good buy, and on Amazon right now with their rebate, you actually get money BACK for buying the phone!If you have any questions about the phone that I haven't answered here, feel free to AIM me at WinterGetsMe
##If you like my review please vote for it! ~ Michele
[t] Tons of features, but still needs some work.
##Pros - Tons of features
##You can download ring tones and pictures from your own computer with USB
##The outside caller ID is also nice
battery[@]##The battery life is good and I have no complaints with the reception
##Cons- The hinge is not as good as Samsung
##The display is not as big as other phones
##The default ring tones and games are horrible
##I am very happy with the Motorola V220
##I paid $50 for this phone and got features that usually cost 2 to 3 times more
##I will start out with some background
##I signed up for a family plan and I bought the V220 for myself and got a Samsung X427 for my wife
##I am a gadget freak without a big budget
##What sold me on the V220 was the USB port
##I wanted to be able to make my own rings and transfer pictures without sending it to e-mail
##This feature by far sets this phone apart from others
##Motorola does not support the USB, but with a little research and Mobile Phone Tools it is possible to connect your phone to your PC with a mini-USB cable
##The V220 also has a caller ID display on the outside
##This is important because if you are in a meeting you don't have to open the phone to see who is calling
##This phone also has voice dial which is cool
##I believe it has speakerphone, but I have not used it
##I also love how the menus and buttons are fully configurable
##So you can setup your phone the way you like it
screen[@],battery[@]##The screen is good and the battery life is much better than my old Sony-Ericcson T306, and I thought the T306 had decent battery life
##I have never had a dropped call (after 2 months of ownership)
##The signal is strong with this phone, and I always had dropped calls with the Sony-Ericcson
##I wanted to throw that phone out the window
price[@],camera[@]##The camera is also a nice feature for a phone in this price range
##Now, the bad
screen[@]##The screen on my wife's Samsung is much better because it is bigger
##Her phone is also a little smaller
##I am disappointed with the default ring tones on the V220 and it doesn't come with a real game
##My biggest complaint is the hinge
##It creaks when you open it and doesn't feel near as solid as my wife's Samsung
##However, the Samsung does not even have a caller ID display on the outside
##The speaker on the V220 is not so good
##When you make your own ring tones you have to be careful because the speaker cannot handle any bass or songs with a lot of instruments
##When it comes down to it, this is a great phone for the money
##This phone was perfect for me because I can do a lot with it
##The Samsung was perfect for my wife because it is simple and elegant
##The V220 has more gadgets
##Motorola needs to work on the hinge design, but I would definitely buy this phone again in a heartbeat
[t] I want my Nokia back ....
##This phone is the worst
##Cingular gave it to me for free
##I got what I paid for
##It turns off randomly
screen[@]##The screen is way too small
camera[@][u]##The  is a joke
##And the menus are very akward
##Can't download pictures because they didn't supply a CD or drivers
##When I asked the guy at Cingular about this - he said you had to e-mail them to your computer
##But, of course, they charge for the e-mail
##Forget it
##I want my Nokia back
[t] Good for basic use
##I have read all of the reviews and I guess that I just don't use my cell phone as much as I thought I did
battery[@]##This phone's battery life will last my husband and I about three days, taking about 4 10-15 minute calls per day
##As for the camera, yes, the quality isn't really there
##I haven't really seen any really great pictures from cell phone though anyway
service[@]##This phone is excellent for basic use, and also, I guess my service area for Cingular is just really great because I don't have any complaints yet
##We have not yet dropped a call, and it has been about two months
##I love the rollover minutes, and Cingular's website is very easy to navigate! But I guess if you talk more than about 40 minutes a day, this wouldn't be for you, but this phone is EXCELLENT for average use, or even for an 'only emergency' phone! Also WAy NICER than other free phones!
[t] I would recommend this phone to anyone.
##I've owned just 4 cell phones since the late 1980's (2 Nokia and 2 Motorolas) and while I am somewhat "technologically challenged", I've found this phone to be fairly easy to navigate and setup
camera[@]##I purchased the V220 about two weeks ago (1) for its size; (2) the keyboard lights up in a neat blue color making it easier to read than some that do not - if you need glasses to read this is a plus! and (3) the camera
##I really don't care about downloading games, sounds, etc
##so I cannot comment on those elements
camera[@][u]##I used the  immediately and you can zoom in or out to make a picture clearer
##It's easy to save a photo or delete one
##I change or add photos for wallpaper and enjoy this feature
sound[@]##For me, the sound is good and using the speakerphone and voice dial are great, no problems
##One negative is the manual that comes w/the phone
##I couldn't setup voice command using the "instructions"
##it is virtually non-existant
##The cellular agent did not know how to set it up either
##Apparently, on previous models it was explained better
##After calling Motorola (very good customer service, by the way) the rep
##walked me through it
##He accessed the manual for my model online even telling me what pages in the manual the instructions were on, then realized why I was having a problem
##He even admitted after trying to find the instructions in the V220 manual, that there was no way I would be able to set it up unless I had had a previous model and had setup voice dial before
##After walking me through it I have no problem adding names and numbers
##Another negative is paying attention to the symbols on the menu
##Remember, I don't care about going online w/the phone
##There are a few menu items w/a symbol next to the item (a globe or the Cingular symbol)
##If you hit those and don't have a plan for net access, etc
##, you will be charged for the time
##It is just a matter of being more careful for me, but probably for most of you, the reason you are getting the phone is to access the net etc
##so it won't be a problem
##Other than the two items above, I really like this phone
##It fits in the palm of my hand perfectly
##It's very attractive and functions well
camera[@]##My favorite things are voice command and the camera
##Personally, I would recommend this phone to anyone
[t] This phone is terrible
##I have had this phone for 6 months and it has been nothing but trouble
service[@][u]##I have Cingular  and they have replaced this phone 3 times for me - with the same phone - V220
##It drops calls EVERY time I try to use it
##It is really frustrating
##Now they are telling me to turn it off every day for 3 minutes in order to receive upgrades
##this isn't working either
##I am now looking to BUY a Nokia phone
##I never had any problems with my old Nokia phone
[t] I took it back the SAME day!
##If you're looking for a good quality picture phone I wouldn't recommend this phone
battery[@]##If you want to see if you're battery is charged or if you have a full signal I wouldn't recommend it
screen[@]##The screen is waaay tooo small and the picture quality is horrible
##My husband picked up the phone for me after I told him I wanted it
##I played with the phone for about an hour and then decided it had to go back
##I took it back and paid the extra money for the motorola v551 which is da bomb all around!! Oh yeah, Motorola instruction booklets are the worst!
[t] Good phone, decent features, lousy support
##This cute little clamshell phone does it job
screen[@][u]##It opens to a small color  and a traditional keypad lit by blue light
##Features include a speaker phone (great for the car if you don't have your headphone attached), camera, voice-activated dialing, international capability, IM, web browsing, alarm, date book, calculator, as well as the more standard caller ID, address book, and call log information
camera[@]##The camera is slow - don't expect to catch anything in motion - but adequate
##The worst feature is the ring tones, as it comes with very few (compare to Nokia's)
##On top of that, the volume is not high enough to hear the phone from the bottom of my purse
service[@]##If you want a distinctive ring tone, you'll have to pay to download tones from your service provider
##Although the phone has a mini USB connector port to download your own music/tones and to upload pictures, you need to find a driver that will work on your computer
##Don't expect help on how to find one
service[@]##The Motorola site is useless, and my service provider salespeople didn't have a clue it was needed
##The thick manual that comes with the phone is barely helpful, as it shows key strokes to access features without explaining crucial information; for example, it tells you how to access new melodies without telling you how to actually accomplish the download
##In general, the manual looks helpful without actually being of use
##As of the writing of this review, the phone seems to be too new for electronic accessory companies to have come up with a non-brand auto charger and headset
service[@]##You'll have to pay your service provider rates if you want these
##On the plus side, the flip phone style makes it small enough to fit into my palm
sound[@]##The sound is good, and the international capabilities (check with your plan) make it more versatile than some of its competitors
##I love that I can create my own wallpaper and screensaver with just a few intuitive key strokes
sound[@]##Eventually, the sound features, with Motomixer and personalized ring tones, will also be great - as long as I find a driver
camera[@]##For a relatively low-end camera phone, its performance is surprisingly good despite the nonexistent support
##Since this phone is often heavily discounted or free when signing a contract, it is well worth considering
[t] Lousy
##I paid to "upgrade" to this cameraphone a year ago
##I can say it has worked, but that is about it
camera[@]##The camera is so low quality that it might as well not be on the phone
##Memory capacity is very low, so you won't get many shots either
software[@]##MP3 ringtone support is a joke - they want you to buy additional software just to have that feature (though there's now a free alternative)
##Pros
[t] Poor Quality But Nice Features
##We have three Motorola V220 phones and two of the three have been replaced due to defects
##Not a good record since we've only had them 6 months
##The problems did start when the phones were about 4 months old so they were still under warranty
##I'm anxiously awaiting the anniversary of my contract with Cingular so I can get new phones and am hoping the new models on the market are more reliable than the V220
screen[@]##The color screen is small (1 " x 1 ") but is clear and has decent color
##The smallness is not a factor unless you play the JAVA games on this phone
##Many of those games will have the bottoms cut off and can make for frustrating game play
##You can choose a variety of downloadable games that will fit this small screen, however, so it's just a matter of finding what works
screen[@]##The screen is also hard to read in bright sunlight conditions, which could be a factor with most phones
##Setup is not as simple as on previous cell phones I've had
##Reading the owner's manual is a must and the instructions are not straightforward at times! I found I had to call technical support to get a few of my questions answered (Cingular tech support was very nice and accommodating)
camera[@]##The Motorola V220 comes with a built-in VGA camera with 4x zoom and has 640 x 480 pixels
##There is no flash, so adequate lighting is necessary and often times the picture comes out grainy
##The phone holds quite a few of these pictures in memory
##An additional accessory that you might want to consider purchasing is the USB cable that will enable you to download your pictures onto your computer
##If you have a problem with the phone, you'll lose your pictures - they are not saved to the SIM card but saved to the phone's memory
##We've lost quite a few pictures due to the problems we've encountered
##The V220 also has Multimedia Messaging Service, which allows sending and receiving of pictures, animations, wallpaper, icons and ring tones
##But there are additional charges on this feature
##Even with the extra charges, these are nice features
##This phone also comes with the basics - like the ability to text message, date book and phonebook synchronization to help organize your life, and a browser that allows for surfing the web
##Phone book capacity is 500
design[@]##The design of the V220 is excellent even though quality is lacking
##It's a lightweight, clamshell type of phone, so you can easily carry it in your pocket without problems
size[@][u]##The number pad and navigation keys are a bit on the small  so those with large hands may have difficulty using it
##The fixed antenna is sturdy and I haven't heard of anyone encountering a problem with it breaking like some with more flimsy antenna
screen[@]##Now the bad part - this phone has a bad reputation for screen problems
##We've had two of the phones replaced and one replacement phone exchanged
screen[@]##All of them had screen issues
screen[@]##Either the screen would go completely blank or it would act like a disco ball and blink
##During the time when the phone would be acting up, it would be next to impossible to place or receive a call
##When I tried calling the number I would get a "Network Failure" error
##When I tried making a call from the phone, it would give a "Network Busy" error
##Very frustrating
##Cingular has replaced the defective phones at no charge because they are under warranty
##I'm just worried about what happens when they are no longer covered
##So how many more phones do they need to replace before they figure out it would be cheaper to get me a different model?Bottom line
[t] Multiple bad experiences
##After owning 2 Nokia phones for over 4 years and never having a problem with either of them, when my plan was up this time the Cingular rep recommended I go with the Motorola V220 due to the value and features
##I have been nothing but disappointed
##The first phone I got did not hold a charge, so I took it back within a few days and had it replaced
##The second one had a distorted screen, so I replaced that one also
##The third one had horrible reception and a crackling noise in the background, so I had that replaced
##Finally the fourth one they gave me seemed to be fine
##for about 2 months
screen[@]##Then the screen started fading in and out, and finally went black altogether
##I never dropped it and always carried it in a padded case
battery[@]##Cingular replaced it with another V220 (now the 5th one in 2 months) and this one was also not working properly as it would not flip completely shut so phone calls would still be connected when it was shut and the battery was being worn down rapidly
##FINALLY, they decided I had been through enough and they are sending me an upgraded V551
##I am still not happy about this, though, because I don't have any faith in Motorola phones at this point
##I'll have to see how the V551 is before I make a judgement, but I can tell you that the V220 is awful
##It is very difficult to use and the users manual is worthless
service[@]##I can't wait until my service contract is up so I can go with another provider and another phone
[t] I'm now on my third.
##I just received my second replacement for this phone in 6 months
##I got this phone because I wanted a cheap phone that had the speakerphone feature
##This one fit the bill
camera[@]##The camera really doesn't work very well, but that doesn't bother me too much
##The problem with this phone is that every three months something goes wrong with it and I have to get a replacement
##My friend has the same problem with a different model of Motorola phone
##I just hope that this replacement lasts longer than the last one
[t] Phone is bad but Cingular is worse
##I ordered this phone and was pretty unhappy with it
##The address book doesn't let you add multiple numbers to one contact, it simply makes two entries for that contact
##The menus were difficult to navigate
##I returned the phone within one day
##What followed was even worse
##I was an AT&T; customer (now Cingular)
##For a month after my return I attempted to upgrade to another phone, only be transferred, told to go online, told to go to the store, told to call, etc
##In one month of trying to work with Cingular, not ONE single solitary person helped me in any way
##I was finally told I needed to just keep my current phone because they couldn't figure out how to upgrade me
##Today I left Cingular and I've never been happier
service[@]##By far the worst customer service I have encountered in any industry
[t] I miss my Nokia!
##I recently bought the v220 when when I renewed my contract because I thought I wanted a cute little flip-phone, but I am sorely missing my old, standard Nokia
##The reception isn't too bad but I've found the v220's usability and functionality to be horrible and its user manual to be worse
##It doesn't do a lot of basic things my old Nokia did and what it does do takes too many steps to get to
##I pretty much hated it from minute one, but decided to give it some more time to see if I got used to it
##But now, to the point
[t] do not buy if you have anger management issues
##I would not recomend this piece of garbage to anyone
##I originally bought this phone through cingular, and it was a giant step forward from my older nokia
battery[@]##About 3 months into the contract, the battery stop charging, would not charge with a wall charger or car charger
##Cingular sent me a new one at no cost to me as it was still under warrantee
##second one came in, and had horrible reception everywhere but the cingular store (surprise surprise) Returned that one, got a third one
##once again, horrible reception
##Long story short, the phone is in many pieces now and i purchased a nokia and love it
##I definitley would not recomend this phone to anyone with anger mangement issues, all kidding aside, this phone is horrible
[t] Bad phone and bad company
##I would give this company a "zero" if possible
##I have a family plan with four lines
##I am repeatedly billed for calls I never made
##The first time I called them, they told me they couldn't do anything about it! Two of the four phones we use are absolute crap
##They have already charged my $150
##00 to replace the v220 that I had recieved for "free
service[@][u]##" No wonder Consumer Reports ranks them at the bottom of  and quality
##I regret having chosen this company but am unfortunately stuck with them for another 18 months
##I will never come back to this company again
##Pick another phone and another company
[t] Horrible Phone!!!!!
##All the bad things said about this phone, believe them
service[@]##My Cingluar service is great because I live in a city so I have wonderful reception
##My first phone with Cingular ever was a Motorola V180
##I had to call in warrantee on it at least 5 times before I went on ebay and bought a Motorola V220 cheap
screen[@],camera[@]##After the screen went, the camera wasn't working properly, my phone went directly to voicemail, text messages weren't coming in, and I couldn't make out going calls a warrantee was called in to replace the phone
##I've had this phone replaced FOUR TIMES
##Cingular is now giving me another crappy phone (this time LG) because they realize how many issues I've had with the V220
##All I want is an upgrade on a phone that WORKS
##All the good looking things of this Motorola V220 might tempt you to buy this phone and the bad things would be countered with the good things
##But this is deceiving!!! Every single one of the 5 V220's I've gotten have had the same issues
[t] Drops 15% of all calls
software[@]##Horrible phone - drops at least 15% of all calls, doesn't ring all the time, software glitchy and crashes
##I have had two separate v220s with the same problems
##Don't get motorola
##I miss my old grayscale denon candybar from sprint
[t] $$$$BIG WAIST OF MONEY$$$$
screen[@],camera[@][u]##It has a washed out screen and has absolutly no  features
##Even in broad daylight, The pictures were dark and hard to see
##The one games that is on there is extremely confusing and pointless to play
##When it first arrived at my house it had to charge for 3 days before we cold do anything to it
battery[@]##I dropped it on the table on accident and the cover came of as the battery did too
##It is NOT reliable in any way shape or form
##It is a piece of junk and $$$$$A BIG WAIST OF MONEY$$$$ YOu could get a better phone for free!
[t] Ok phone.
##This is an ok phone but if you are buying it for the picture quality forget it
camera[@]##the camera is'nt that good the pictures are blury and it only works in moderate light
##I bought it i was happy at first but then i noticed how bad the pictures were and i wish i would have gotton a differant picture phone , now im stuck with it for a year with cingular
##Overall its an ok phone
[t] This Phone Is Great!
##I tried the V220 out at the store and I don't want to wait to get it
##Pros-Camera (good pics)Music Tones (Real Songs)SpeakerphoneColor ScreenFlip PhoneAOL Instant MessengerDownload Games, Ringtones, GraphicsCons-No Good Ringtones Built In PhoneOther than that it is a great phone
##I wuld reccomend buying this phone
[t] Horrible phone
##I have two of these phones
##We recieved them for free with our calling plan
##One does not hold a charge and we were unable to get it replaced
##I brought it to the store and was told to mail it back
##I called to get the address and was told to bring it to a store nearby
##I brought it back to the store and was told they could not replace it
##I was told that this is a known problem with this phone
[t] Piece of Crap
##I've had this phone for almost a year, and while I was disappointed with the phone when it arrived (it was super cheap when we extended our contract--something else that we're not going to do again), it served my purpose for the most part
##However, I have found that reception is absolutely HORRIBLE
##I live in east Tennessee, hello! we have mountains! I never had a problem with reception on my old phone and it was with the same carrier
##Now, I don't get reception along a MAJOR highway which I drive frequently
screen[@]##God forbid that my car break down and I need to make a phone call! Recently (like, within the past week), the screen has gone out for no reason
##I haven't dropped the phone--I don't even use it that often because 90% of the time when I finally have time to make a phone call on it, I don't have reception
##Case in point, I have over 1,000 rollover minutes and have used a grand total of 1 minute on my cell phone plan this month
##I could deal with the crappy ringtones, the pathetic pictures, the menus upon menus upon menus, the quietness of the cell phone ring (if it's in a purse or something, forget about hearing it ring--even on its loudest setting), but I can't handle crappy quality and an essential waste of my money when I can't use my phone
##DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! Parents, I know that it's Cingular's GoPhone, but pick another company and get a different cell phone--don't waste your hard-earned money on this piece of crap
[t] No Tech Techs?
##My new Motorola V220 works fine
##What doesn't work is Cingular's web pesence
##I have yet to log on even once in over a year to find things actually working and usable! For 5 months it refused to accept my password no matter what
internet[@][u]##I made the mistake of electing to eliminate mailed bills, that was before I discovered I would probably never be allowed  access to MY ACCOUNT
##Oh, I try every month just for the novelty, I call and complain but no one is any help
##Usually I'm told I must be typing the password incorrectly
##There was the one time I managed to sweet talk my way into the account by typing the password every which way possible
##But that was just a cruel trick, as once in, it refused to take my money
##No matter how I tried it could not verify my credit card and charge it
##The same card I use all day every day on dozens of lessor corporations was a total mystery to Cingular
##Of course now I don't get a paper bill anymore, which complicates matters even more
##However, Cingular manages without fail to tell me by e-mail every month that my bill is ready for viewing at MY ACCOUNT
##HA! HA! You see they dn't need a password to get through to me, so I can get their e-mails, but can't actually look at the bill they are so kind to tell me about
##The last two months I tried to access MY ACCOUNT I ran into a new stonewall, a message telling me that MY ACCOUNT is closed for repairs, or upgrades [yeah, that's a laugh] and will be open at some future date, no promises, the date is apparently to be determined
##Then this evening I decided to treat myself to a couple of less boring ring tones than those that came free with the phone
##First, I discovered that if you put "ring tones" into the search engine to find the page with ring tones it will feign ignorance
##It can't find anything called ring tones
ringtones[@][u]##Ah, but I am not so eaily discouraged, a little browsing and I discover the pages, under the word 
##So it seems the poor rickety search engine cannot grasp the similarity of 'ringtones' and 'ring tones', clearly my mistake
##Then I spent a happy half hour browsing through all the great Star Wars offerings
##Finally settled on the classic Star Wars theme and a sexy growl from Chewbacca
##Read the instructions for downloading, filled out the required download phone number and clicked continue
##Only to run into a new password request
##It seems I need to be registered on this part of the website, and MY ACCOUNT user name and password, wait for it
##won't work! Thinking I could fool my way in again I clicked on the new registration button, only to meet once more the NOT WORKING notice
ringtones[@]##You can't open an account for ringtones right now, it's being upgraded [ahem!] for my convenience
##Well it's not convenient, I am appalled at the horrible low class technology being foisted on high tech lovers
design[@][u]##How can such a high tech phone company have such clunky web presence? My 9 year old grandson could  better
##Why aren't all of the other Cingular users gathering at midnight with burning torches and tempers to match? Am I the only one that attempts to use the website? Maybe I am
##Or maybe they just lay in wait, lurking behind the server until I try to do anything, and blam! they make sure only little me can't make the damn thing work
##Hmmm
##could be, but I suspect the truth is Cingular has chosen to go to the dark side
##I guess I'll take Han's advice and let the Wookie win
##I understand if I look around I can buy ring tones elsewhere
##Miss Kitty Concord, CA
[t] Very handy and compact phone
##motorola V220 is a value for maoney phone
##Its having lot of inbuilt features
camera[@][u]##I liked its 
[t] Cool Phone!!*****
##The Motorola V220 is the phone of the year
##It is small,sleek, and has very nice features
##I had the V188 which is very similar to the V220
##I rate this phone (v220) 4 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!
[t] good features, small lcd, some lacking features.
##Previously I had Motorola T720
##It was a very good phone and I lost it and got V180 and also tried V220
camera[@]##the only difference is that 220 has a camera
##Pros
[t] Hello Crapo
##This phone was a huge dissapointment
screen[@]##The screen is small and you can barely hear any of the ring tones
##Even though you can set up the quick keys to your liking nothing seems accessible because the phone is really cramped
##Perhaps a person with dainty hands and lot of time to navigate through the sub-standard menu navigtion would love this phone
##I do not
camera[@]##The camera does take decent shots with adequate lighting
##I was a faithful Motorola customer
[t] Good phone but be watch your bill
##I received my phone and everything was good
##When I looked at my bill Amazon did not close out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular
##So Cingular tried to charge me some liquidation fee of $30
##I called and had it removed
[t] the worst phone ever
battery[@]##This is the worst phone ever!!!!! My phone broke after 1 week, he front completely shattered and the battery completely died after 1 year
##It is the biggest rip of in the universe!
[t] Motorola KRZR
##I purchased my Motorola KRZR about a month ago to replace my Motorola RAZR
##My observations on the KRZR are
[t] phone just dies in converstaion
##this has happened at least 6 times after getting my phone 2 months ago
##during a conversation, suddenly i can't hear anything and pushing bottoms (except pushing the shut-down bottom hard) doesn't work either
##i have to re-start the phone and apologize to the person that was on the phone
##this phone is an eye-candy, but it has a quality of M$ windows 98
[t] So far So Good!
sound[@][u]##This phone has excellent  quality, very very clear from both end of the line, and has excellent reception
sound[@]##If you just want a cell phone just to make call and receive call, then this one is for you, because of the sound quality and reception
##You won't be disappointed
##If you want to use all other function like text
##MP3 or taking pictures, then it is so so like many other on the market
[t] Over 2 years of this little phone...
##I'm fixing to trade my 2nd little KRZR in on a new phone
##I'm gonna miss the KRZR
##it's one of the coolest looking phones I've ever seen
##My first KRZR I had was AWESOME, great sound, great camera, great apps, great everything
##Then I dropped it in the pool
##I had insurance so for $50 they sent me a new one
##This one was a refurb and I could tell the side buttons didn't work that good, they were loose
screen[@]##The only major problems I've had is that the buttons are cheap, along with the screen (both plastic that comes off very easily) also the speaker on mine just BOOM got quiet, now it's like volume 7 is volume 2
##It's not just me either no one can hear on my KRZR anymore
##I was up for an upgrade so I figured it's time to trade the poor little thing in
##The bluetooth isn't the greatest
##it sends pics, ringtones, blah blah but it's hard to find most other phones
##It could just be shy or anti-social I don't know
##Mine has been through a lot of talking though I have about 2,000 hours on it
##I talk all the time
##I'm not sure if that's a lot of hours compared to the amount of wear and tear on it or not
battery[@]##The back plate of the phone (the battery cover) is peeling but I've never had it fall off
##Battery life is pretty good
##I don't text so keeping that in mind the keys are okay minus the cheap fact, but nothing that super glue can't fix
##The memory expanding is awesome, I didn't really need to buy a memory card because this phone has over 19,900 KB but I got it anyways and it's very handy
camera[@]##The camera is cool, it comes with some different editting options
ringtones[@]##You can set different ringtones for different people along with pics (of course)
##Overall, GREAT phone with just a few minor details
[t] KRZR K1 Phone
##Really good phone
##Perfect reception
battery[@]##Only issue with battery
##it doesn't last long but still worth it
[t] Come on! This is a great phone!
##I've had it for almost a month and am very satisfied
##Great reception, simple easy-to-use menus just like the RAZR
##It looks awesome, feels very solid and the rubberized back helps the grip
camera[@]##The camera takes decent pics and although the videos are not high quality, it was perfect to document moments of my trip to Iceland
##Overall it's been great, besides not only was it free but I will get $50 from AT&T!
[t] Best phone I've had in years
##I have almost nothing to complain about with this phone other than it will ocassionally on it's own change the volume and ring setting
##For those of you that have problems with earpiece volume, this phone has one the loudest and clearest of any phone I've owned
##Yes, I've heard that if this phone is dropped, it will shatter into a million pieces
##I dropped mine twice and nothing happened
##I might have been lucky, but just don't drop the phone
##The buttons are a little touchy and sometimes it's necessary to be careful
##Overall, it's been a great phone for me, and although my 2 years are up and I'm eligible for a new phone, I'm keeping this one
[t] KRZR--Not a good decision
##I was all excited when I got my Krzr because it fit conveinently in my pocket and wouldn't randomly dial my friends
##However, those were the only 2 redeeming characteristics of this phone
##The buttons are small, and even though I'm a tiny person with small fingers I continually pressed mutiple buttons
##This makes text messaging so frustrating that I virtually quit texting my friends
##Also, this phone will continually buzz or beep when it has a new voicemail
##roughly once an hour
service[@][u]##However, if you are going in and out of  (say in a stadium or just driving) it will go off every time you leave and enter a  area
##There is NO way to make this stop (unless you turn all alerts on your phone off)
##It will drive you insane
##Finally, after having this phone a short time, it began freezing up
battery[@]##Sometimes it would let me shut down and reboot, other times I had to wait for the battery to die
##After I picked up a call, sometimes it would still ring
##Other times, it would ring when I had the phone on vibrate
##When I went to the store to complain about these problems I was told that this was a crappy phone, and the only reason they were pushed was because of promotions
##So, thank you sprint and motorola for promoting such a POS phone
##I will definitely be more responsible when I upgrade
[t] Good basic phone
##I bought the krzr k1 to replace the motorola v330
##I've had it for almost a month now
##Most of the features are pretty standard these days
##2MP camera, a slot for MicroSD card, voice dial etc
camera[@][u]##The  isn't great but is useful when you lack a digital 
battery[@]##It's got a great battery life
##It can last upto week on standby and moderate phone usage, much better than the v330
##Overall, it's a good phone if you're looking for basic call features
##Pros
[t] Good voice quality, unfriendly interface
##I purchased this phone about 4 months back and have used it enough to understand its pros and cons
##While the phone has a number of positives - including good voice quality (both sides), many useful feature including bluetooth which works just fine
##The main issues I found with this phone are
[t] The best ever had
##I bought the phone about 3 months ago and just love it
##It has so many more options then any of my other cell phones I have had in the past
camera[@]##The camera portion of it has so many different options
##Like if you want black and white, antique, bluish or even negative, you can have it
##Also you can adjust the lighting conditions
##The only down fall about this phone is that it takes a while to get used to and also how to get around
##I am still finding new items with this phone, that I didn't even know were on it
##I wouldn't recommend this phone for a guy though, due to its sleek girlie look
[t] Just stops working!
##I purchased 3 phones for my family
##a V3xx, a Nokia 6126 and this KRZR for myself
##It was the only one that was DOA right out of the box
##Okay, not a big deal, one defective unit
##I sent it back and received another one
##This one worked great
##or so I thought
##But a week after having it my wife called on my land line and said she was calling and calling but I wasn't picking up my cell
##I checked, and it had no indication of any calls
##I tried calling out and it wouldn't dial
##It was frozen
##sort of
##So I thought, maybe it needed a reset
##I powered down, powered up, and it worked fine the rest of the day
##Okay, it was a fluke
##But then it did the same thing the next day, then the next
##It sure is a beautiful and compact phone and I'm going to miss that, but I'm dumping it because I need a phone that works ALL the time, not just part of it
##Sorry Motorola, I've been a loyal customer, but you blew it with this phone
[t] Excellent
##Easy to use, easy to handle, loud and clear
##Only problem I had was that I can't switch the clock to military time, which would have been nice working at a police station
##Other than that, this is perfect
[t] Worst piece of electronic equipment ever
##This phone is the worst piece of garbage I've ever owned
##I've owned 2 in 6 months and I barely even use it
battery[@]##The first one just decided to never turn on again and the second's battery only lasted a month before it no longer holds a charge
service[@]##Not to mention the complete lock down of the phone from the service provider
##To even use 1/2 the functions, you need an SD card
[t] Nice but has issues
battery[@]##The KRZR is a really cool looking phone - but it has 2 huge issues - a very short battery life (1 day) and sllloooowwww reaction time - push the menu key and WAIT for it to come up
##I would explore other options
[t] KRZR not worth the money
##I returned this phone after one week
software[@]##Currntly the Motoral software has a glitch and you can't assign specifice ring tones to phone number
sound[@][u]##Ear piecs  quality is marginal
##text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small
##The back panel display is too small and hard to read
[t] KRZR only so-so
##I wish I could give it five stars since it is so gorgeous
##However, moving from a Nokia 6230, this phone has issues
camera[@],battery[@]##Pluses compared to my Nokia, good battery life, bigger, easier to see buttons which are better backlit, much better camera and video
##Can't comment on music since I don't use it as an MP-3 player
software[@]##My biggest complaint is that, dispite having great connection with the matched H-670 bluetooth earpiece, the voice recognition software is utterly useless
##Voice commands of the simplest type are totally misunderstood
##I tell it
[t] Just wanted to warn##When I lost the charger than went together with my KRZR I couldn't even think what a huge problem it was
##My phone has a mini-USB port and I knew that my husband charged his old Motorola from ANY computer with a mini-USB cable
##I tried to use that cable but couldn't charge it and kept getting error messages
internet[@]##I thought it was a faulty device but looked over the internet and found that Motorola PURPOSELY made their cell phones incompatible with normal USB cables to cause a lot of problems with their customers
##I was not able to use my cell phone for several days which was especially upsetting during a trip
##One of the reasons I liked Motorolas was that they could charge from any computer's USB port
##Now I see I was wrong and my next phone won't be Motorola
[t] Great phone except for the time display
##I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wireless's "New Every Two" program
##My main gripe with the phone is that, unlike my former phone (Motorola V265), it cannot be set to display the time in the 24-hour format (I do not use am/pm)
screen[@]##Otherwise, the screen is nice and bright, it's easy to use, it's much less bulky than my former phone, and the voice activation is easier
[t] Good Stuff
##Not much to say except I love this phone
##can't imagine how I got by without it
[t] Durable. Really, really durable.
##Whatever else you want to say about this phone, I'll tell you this
[t] Too bad
##I was excited about the style and sleekness
##Unfortunately, the quality doesn't match up
##The messaging is screwy
##It isn't very reliable
##It doesn't always ring when someones calling even though you're in range
##Plus, I dropped it once and the front is cracked! I don't know about you, but i need a strong phone that can take a little beating
##Would NEVER get this phone again
[t] Great Phone
##I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer
##I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned
##The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didn't intend but it's really not that big of a deal; I just need to re-train my hands
##I am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality
ringtones[@][u]##The audio options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as  and Motorola made this a pretty simple task
[t] KRZR KI
##If you are looking for a phone that has that "WOW" factor along with all the bells and whistles this is it
##When choosing a phone we should all look to be sure that we are going to get the most use out of it's features
##I happen to buy this phone to replace an Audiovox P4100 PDA phone that I have used for over four years but unfortunately was stolen
##I felt that switching from a PDA to a regular phone was going to be a long drawn out process and that I could not expect the same use out of a regular phone that I was getting out of a PDA I soon realized that this phone has certain everyday features that I could easily incorporate in my daily business routine that my PDA did not have
##Before I go into the phone's list of features let me say that I found the "feel" of this phone to be solid, unlike the Razors on the market that feel as if they are going to crumble in my hands
screen[@]##I thought that the small screen was going to be a hinder but I find the graphics and overall screen resolution superior and easily readable
##This phone has an abundance of features but I will go into the ones that I use
software[@]##First of all it's contact list and calendar dates, with the use of Motorola's Phone Tools software could easily be sync'd with my PC
##This was an immediate plus
camera[@]##I soon found use for the phone's 2 Meg camera
camera[@]##I'm a jeweler and I used the camera to take pictures of merchandise I've been interested in adding to my store's inventory
##Once I did this I had the choice of looking over the pictures from the cellphone or downloading them into my PC
##The pictures are crisp and the detail is easily seen
##I also stored a number of my own inventory pictures to show any prospects
##This was easily done after I installed an additonal 2 Gig memory card in the phone
##Perhaps the best feature of this phone is it's bluetooth abilities which are a safety factor when driving
##I've transfered a number of songs from my PC but I don't have any headphones to listen to the quality of audio and can't give you any insight into this
##All in all I can assure you this phone will knock off your socks! As one review stated "it's taken the best features from other Motorola phones and improved on them"
##If only the wireless access plans could say the same!
[t] Good phone, but bad repair problems
##First off, let me say that this is was an attractive phone with all of the features I wanted
##The problem I had was that, within a month of activating the thing, it simply stopped working
##I sent it to Motorola for repairs and now, 2 months later, despite having confirmation delivery and UPS tracking numbers, no one knows where the phone is
##I have yet to talk to anyone outside of India and Argentina (Motorola's call centers), which is a big problem when all I need is someone at the Memphis, TN facility
##I received five promises of call backs "within 24 hours" to tell me the status of the repair with no calls to date
##Bottom line is, if you end up with a working version of this phone, you should be happy with it
##Just consider that if the need arises for repairs, you may never see your phone again
service[@][u]##(I think I've just about given up on it after breaking 10 hours on the phone with Motorola--no exaggeration) You have to take into account the terrible customer  you'll get, and whether the risk is worth it for a cool phone
[t] Stylish and functional but slow
##I am coming from a Razr and the Krazr is a great phone, no doubt
size[@][u]##The  is the main attraction
##Fits easily in your pocket without a bulky case
##Screen is a bit small and the menus are slow
##The quality also does not match the Razr, it is not as clear or toned
##The micro SD card is a great feature and the mp3 player is huge
##It also takes pretty good pictures
##I would recommend this to anyone
[t] Horrible customer service
##First off, this phone is great but do not order it from Amazon
##I have shopped happily at Amazon for 10 years and decided to order 2 phones with a family plan despite many negative reviews for phones purchased from Amazon
##When I received the phones I ordered one of them was the wrong phone
##One week, several frustrating emails, and several horrible phone calls later I am at the point where I can return both phones and cancel my Cingular service, which is the only option I have
##For some reason Amazon refuses to simply exchange the phone I had ordered with the incorrect one that they sent
##This makes absolutely no sense
##Both phones are free with the plan I ordered
service[@][u]##The worst part of all was the flaming hoops that Amazon makes you jump through in order to receive any customer 
service[@]##and to call the mountain of headaches they provided customer service is a gross overstatement
##Pay a little bit for the phones to get them in person somewhere, the aggravation you'll save is priceless
##*I think it's important to mention that despite being an avid online shopper for about ten years I have never found it necessary to write a negative review until now
[t] Motorola Krzr K1 Gold Cell Phone, Is it really an Excellent Phone?
##After using this phone for few weeks, and after reading a lot of reviews and comments about it, I came to the conclusion that the Motorola Krzr K1 Gold Cell Phone Is really an Excellent Phone, but with few minor glitches
##The ultra-sleek Motorola KRZR K1 shows a new standard of stunning style and innovation, it has a remarkable functionality, rich in first-class multimedia and entertainment capabilities, global connectivity and more
##Some of its features are
[t] Good Phone, AT&T's cell coverage questionable in my service area
service[@]##I recently bought the Motorola KRZR when I switched from Sprint/Nextel to AT&T; - a choice forced on me by Sprint's abysmal customer service and their apparent goal of moving all voice customers off of the old Nextel iDEN network
##The KRZR is more or less on par, in terms of features, with my 2-1/2 year old Nextel Motorola i860 phone - the difference being that the KRZR is much lighter, sleeker and up to date in terms of design, with significant improvements in terms of the user interface
##(The i860 was kind of clunky-looking, and heavy, even at the time I purchased it, back in the summer of 2005
##)I find the KRZR's menu system to be easy to use and well thought out
sound[@]##The sound quality is good, though just a tad harder to hear in noisy environments than my i860 was
camera[@]##The KRZR's camera is for the most part excellent
[t] Terrible phone
battery[@]##My battery would die out in half a day, yes I charged it as specified
##Had to get a new one within months
##Finger prints are not a problem if you have a cover, but then you cannot see then phone finish
##The buttons are a pain to use, the voice activation works when it wants, and i s s l o w
##Although many functions appear to be somewhat faster with this new battery, I would not recommend this phone to any adult
##The younger crowd probably loves it's color and mp3, not for me
##NEW BATTERY,NO JOY!!E V E R Y B U T T O N T A K E S 4 E V E R T O C H A N G E F U N C T I O N, TAKES 15 Seconds to turn volume up or down
##Getting a new phone, you can buy this one from me on ebay, I will pay you to take it
[t] Motorola KRZR
##This Motorola KRZR is an excellent phone
##I had just purchased this about a month ago to replace my Razr (which was also a fine phone) and I immediately liked it much better
##Here are my observations, both pro and con
[t] BEST OF THE BEST.....
##I just love this little telephone
##Clarity is one of the best of all the telephones offered today! I highly recommend this phone for women because of the small features, my husband has a hard time with using it because his hands are larger than mine
##I'm not a petite woman by far either
##Fits perfect in my pocket with no discomfort
[t] Junk phone
##It hangs so frequently
##Needs to be powered off the phone to receive or make calls, when it hangs
##Digital Music player doesn't respond
##Planning to replace with some other phone
[t] Disappointed by Motorola...again
##I bought a brand new Motorola C600 back in the day
##After about a year, it became very difficult to hear callers as they spoke and as time progressed, it just got worse
##After having the phone for two years, I went against my better judgment and bought another Motorola phone--the KRZR
##I loved the compactness, the V-Cast features (which turned out not to be worth it--talk about slow web surfing!!), and the deep red color of the model I chose
##However, now, again after one year, the phone is LOSING ITS ABILITY TO AUDIBLY RING
##It sometimes rings aloud but most often I have to keep it in my HAND so I can feel the vibration if someone calls
##Why don't I keep it in my pocket? Because the vibration is SO WEAK, you miss it
##Even when it was fully functional, the phone vibrates so weakly, you can't feel it in your pocket
##I'd strongly recommend skipping this phone
[t] motorola krzr the worse
##it's the 2nd phone you sent me and it is the same as the first one after I use it 3 or 4 days it does not work anymore and after talking with att 3 or 4 time the support technitians tell me to turn it off and on again and it starts working again its the worse phone i ever had and I dont undestand whow you dont have more complaints I have to buy a new phone and I will definitely won't buy it from you
##thanksJuan P
[t] Terrible Quality
##This phone was terrible from the start
screen[@][u]##The  would flash in and out and it would freeze constantly
##These clam shell phones are known for having problems with their screens
##I will never buy a clamshell phone again
##I ended up bying a cheap Chinese phone because I thought it would be better than this miserable phone, and it is
[t] If I could rate this phone a negative, I would
##I bought this phone through AT&T;, not Amazon, but regardless of where you buy this phone you'll be getting the same results
[t] size DOES matter
##I owned and used the Motorola RAZR since it was introduced and have enjoyed the features it offers
##When my last RAZR began to fall apart due to age and use I figured what the heck, maybe it's time for something different
##I spotted the KRZR, looked at all the pretty pictures, read about the features and decided this was the phone to go with
##While a little bit more expensive than a new RAZR V3 I figured it would be worth it
##WRONG
size[@][u]##I am basing my opinion purely on the comfort and  of the phone
##While the KRZR is attractive I cannot get used to the keys
##They are too small
##While they do have a nice soft touch feel it does not compensate for the sacrafice of a good large key pad
##Next, this phone is narrow
##It does not feel right in the hand
##It feels like I'm going to lose control and drop it at any moment
screen[@]##Last is the screen
##When open the display is much smaller than the RAZR
##Since I generally wear bifocals this doesn't make it any easier
##An example is the phone list which is too small and cramped
##Now you're probably wondering if I am a guy with giant hands and is all thumbs
##I'm not
##My hands are of average size, and I play guitar
##I can switch from acoustic to electric with no problem in spite of the neck differences
##The bottom line is this phone would better fit a person with smaller hands and 20/20 vision
##Tween comes to mind
##While I cannot dispute some of the advanced features the phone has to offer, I will only use this as an emergency backup
##What about my RAZR? I decided to see if I can get it refurbished, but if it is too expensive I will just go out and buy another V3
##( I really don't need all the additional bells and whistles of the latest RAZR ) If I had done this instead of getting the KRZR I would have saved $20 and a bit of time writing this review
size[@]##I will say that if I ever decide to venture away from what it is comfortable, I will try it on for size
##In this case, the phone just doesn't fit
[t] Nice and Bright
##I had a SLVR L7 which was a couple of years old
##It worked fine, however it was not "EDGE" compatible and was slow to retrieve my email
screen[@]##The SLVR also had a color screen that was impossible to read in direct sunlight
##AT&T;/Cingular works great in my area and wherever I go so I did not want to change carriers
##My new KRZR addressed all my SLVR problems
screen[@]##The phone works with AT&T;'s EDGE network and the color screen is very "sunlight readable"
##I no longer have to hide my phone in my ball cap in order to read what number I'm dialing
##I like it
##Amazon was very easy to upgrade through with AT&T; and everything went smoothly
price[@][u]##I got a good  on the phone that I wanted and what more could a person ask for
##However, my "cats" still asked for more food in their food bowls
##Some creatures are never satisfied
##My local AT&T; store was very nice about transferring my numbers from my old SIM to my new SIM although I guess I could have done it myself by following Amazon's instructions
##The AT&T; store has a machine that is dedicated to that process
##All in all, an easy transaction
##Go ahead and get your new phone from Amazon, they do a good job of interfacing between you and the carrier
[t] Best RAZR Spinoff So Far
##Got this phone as my upgrade and was extremely impressed
##The slim look to it and MP3 playing options are awesome
##Very customizable but finding a GOOD case for it seemed to be difficult
[t] Great phone for the price.
##I recently bought this phone
sound[@][u]##I was a little disappointed initially with the  quality when not using the speakerphone
##But since then it either started working good or I got adjusted to the quality ;-)
##One other complaint I have is that you have to open the phone to use the speaker phone
##But once you get used to opening the phone with one hand it wont be such a problem any more
camera[@]##When you open the phone and place it on a flat surface (say when typing something or so) it wobbles because the camera protrudes from the rear
##Once again this is a minor issue
##I like using the QWERTY keyboard to enter my contacts and notes
##The calendar allows you to enter events
##I like this functionality a lot
##You can assign shortcuts(4) to things that you do the most
##Bluetooth functionality works well
battery[@]##The battery is really good (although most batteries tend to do good at the beginning)
camera[@]##The pictures taken with the camera are good
[t] Krzr K1
##I got my new phone for just $0
##01 when I renewed my contract for 2 more years
##The phone showed up quickly and came with easy set up instructions
##I haven't been able to get the phone to be recognized by my computer with my Motorola Phone Tools, not sure what the problem is there
##I do like the new address book interface that allows you to enter more than one phone number for each contact so that you don't have multiple listings for a person with a business and a mobile phone
##Seems well constructed, and durable
[t] Motorola KRZR K1
##Very good phone
##Compact, light, stylish, with easy to navigate menu
##A bit slow in responses but overall very satisfactory
[t] MOTO Store Discount
##Use this code at the online Motorola store to save 15% off most items
##Here is the code
[t] its ok...not great not bad.
##reliability wise seems to work fine
##the OS is kinda slow
##The buttons are a bit too mashed next to each other and I keep hitting the 'net' button, when i don't mean to and i get charged for that b/c it immediately sends some bytes even if you hit cancel right away b/c the OS doesn't register that you are trying to cancel
##so that works into the carrier's favor as each time it tallies up some data bytes to charge you for
camera[@]##very smudgey with finger marks, but seems to be pretty reliable, the camera quality is pretty decent with the 2mp
[t] OK Phone, But the visa gift card never show up as promised by amazon
##Be very careful if any rebate or gift card related item is tied to your amazon purchase
##You may never be able to get it or only through very hard struggle to get it from amazon
##The phone works OK
##No fancy fucntions is need
price[@][u]##Lower  plan should be the key
[t] Best birthday gift
##I decided to treat myself to a new phone since my existing contract with another carrier was up
##So far, I've had my phone over six weeks and no complaints to date
##I am a texting freak with my friends and the QWERTY board does make quick work of any messages that I need to compose or reply to
camera[@]##The 2 megapix camera resolution plus autofocus feaature is fantastic
##CONS
[t] Nice tech gadget /toy
##The phone is impressively intuitive
##I have had no problem learning to use the various features
##I can't really comment on Vcast because it is not available in my area
camera[@]##The camera and keyboard are the best features that I appreciate the most
##Texting is so much faster for me now
service[@]##Verizon has the best local service for me compared to any other provider
##They tend to be a bit arrogant when dealing with problems on the phone yet I suppose they can since they have such good coverage of my area
service[@]##I don't like their customer service from their stores to their customer reps on the phone but they get the job done and that's what matters to me at the moment
##If you buy the phone, buy a Gb of Micro SD memory
##You are going to need it if you plan to have music on your phone
##It just has enough memory for basic needs on its own
camera[@]##Pros- Easy to use- Qwerty keyboard-Mp3 player-Built in Stereo speakers- Great camera for stills or movie-Large Screen- Bluetooth is painless and easy to pair
##Cons- Not desktop compatible
##No easy way to synchronize contacts
##Not enough onboard memory
##There is no excuse for not having a lot of built in memory due to the prices of flash memory now
##Both of these problems are easily taken care of by simply using the external memory to ferry data from desktop to phone but I am getting tired of companies not using the available tech to solve my problems out of the box
camera[@]##One other problem that's mildly annoying is that the phone cannot sit flat on a table because of the "hump" for the camera lens cover
##so if you sit the little guy on a table and try to use the keyboard, its rocks and slides around
##While this is a surprisingly recurring irritation, it's still a petty complaint
##Phone is a bargain and does what it should
##I do not regret my purchase
[t] Lame Duck!
##This is my first "flip phone" and I still can't get the hang of opening this phone with one hand
##It's always full of fingerprints which ruins the visual appeal of the glass face
button[@]##I find that the keypad can't be done just by feel and the darn keypad backlight needs the keypad pushed to come back on but also when to push the mystery button it also tries to perform that function
##Call quality is fine but doesn't do much else
ringtones[@]##Camera and ringtones are mediocre and no free games! Also kinda heavy but I do like the speakerphone
[t] sync software will wipe out contacts on your computer
##The phone is reasonably good, assuming you don't mind it crashing once or twice per day
software[@][u]##If you need to sync with Microsoft Outlook, however, you need to buy  separately for about $40
##It will take an hour or so to download
##After a couple of syncs, you will find that a lot of information has been lost on your computer
##The phone, for example, cannot deal with a contact that has just a business name and no person's name
##First the contacts show up as headless zombies on the phone
##Then the company name gets wiped out from Outlook on your computer
[t] Excellent Phone!
sound[@],design[@][u]##I bought this phone because the  and the sound quality
sound[@]##Before purchasing this phone, I used to have Motorola L7 SLVR which I was very dissapointed with the sound quality
##SLVR looked good but KRZR is much better
##And obviously KRZR is superior than RAZR
##Pros
[t] Awesome phone
##This phone is incredible, and I'm so happy I bought it through Amazon
##very good deal and smooth transaction! I definitely recommend getting this phone
##Here's my run-down of it
[t] Not what I expected...
##After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, I purchased
##Here are the main issues I have found with this phone
[t] Superb Phone!!!!!
##I've only had the phone for a week but I am extremely pleased with the performance and funcitonality so far
##I was hesitant to get the KRZR K1 because of the some of the negative reviews but my experience has been nothing short of excellent
##I purchased this phone because it is smaller than the wider frame of the RZRs but it is still well built and contains all the same capabilities
##I paired this phone with thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged]and the combination has worked very well
##The voice recognition through the bluetooth headset is outstanding even when I am driving in a car
##I also purchased theSandisk Micro SD 2 GBto store MP3 songs in the phone so that I have alternative to my iPod
##If you want to listen to music with decent audio quality then you will need to purchase a bluetooth stereo headphones or an adapter for a standard headphone jack
##I've played with all of the functions including the video and still camera, calendar, alarm, calculator and they all work pretty much the same as other phones
##The downsides to the phone are
[t] Great Cell Phone
##I have always purchased Motorola products because of the quality of their handsets
##The KRZR is no exception
##The phone has a great "feel" of quality in the case, flip hinge, keys and buttons
##The reception and speakerphone are excellent
##The phonebook entries permit multilple numbers and "types" (mobile,home,work
##etc) for each entry
##Then you can use the voicedial feature to say "call jim mobile" or "call jim home" to auto dial the number
##Additionally, this phone can dial a number by speaking "call 123 4567"
##User created ring tones are a snap
##There are 2 features (create tone) and (voice record) that allow you to save audio
##With create tones, you enter a sequence with your keypad, save this as a ringtone, and apply it as a distinctive ring for all or any number of people
##The voice record is similar
##I have recorded "Jim Calling" and saved as a distinctive ring for Jim
##In the car, I dont have to look at the phone to see who is ringing me
##I suppose you could use the voice record feature to record music also, but I have not done this
##My personal cell phone requirements exclude the more advanced features
##So, I cannot comment on the music player or web browser capabilities of this phone
[t] Decent Phone
##I switched to this phone from Verizon e815
##Some of the details I find different
[t] A good phone, with some caveats
##Pluses
[t] Exceeded expectations so far!!!
##I have been using my KRZR for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations
##I will try to touch on some things not commented about so much in other reviews
##Music portability, awesome
##With the cable that came with my girlfriend's V3i I have had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone
##There is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may not transfer, blah blah blah, but there have been only very few songs with any problem
##I have transferred 60 songs so far onto a 2GB mico card I bought and it has been great
sound[@],size[@][u]##The KRZR has powerful little speakers that put out a great sound volume and quality for the 
##Playlists will also continue to play when the phone is closed, which I found a very nice and convenient touch
##I re-upped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increased signal reception, which is nothing to sneeze at considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR, so I didn't have some POS crap phone prior to the KRZR
internet[@][u],button[@]##As with RAZRs, you have to be careful not to hit the  button (i wish you could lock keys like on Nokia), but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that
##Overall a great phone
##I wish Motorola provided you with a disk full of programs INCLUDED with the phone like I was able to get with my Nokia 7610, but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phone itself
size[@]##Some have commented on having trouble with the buttons on RAZRs and KRZRS, but for an average size guy with average sized hands, this has not been a problem at all
##SO FAR, SO VERY GOOD!
[t] sleek design with great features
##I got my phone 3 days ago (fyi) and have played with it, put my contacts & preferences
##I even tried downloading & uploading pictures & music
##I was surprised that it let me use a whole song as a ringtone
battery[@]##Initially, after I charged the battery the first time, it stalled and I was a bit worried
##But everything is fine now
##although it does start up slower than my old sony ericsson
##Speaking of which, I was going to get sony ericsson w810i but hesitated because I didn't want a candy bar phone
##Then the free phone deal for the SE w810i was withdrawn and I ended up w/ the krzr
##I like the voice command too
##it picks up exactly what I say and I can call anybody using it (whereas my old phone only lets me call select people in my phonebook using the voice command)
##Also, I can use the speakerphone while dialing a number and not only after contact has been made
##So far so good
##it reacts a little slow sometimes but it doesn't seem to be the norm and the features (2 mp photos, mp3 music and ringtones, comprehensive voice command) are great
##So I've had the phone for over a month
##It's still slow when you turn it on
##but it has not frozen on me or malfunctioned (unlike what the other reviews said)
##I did buy a phone case to protect it from cracking (again I'm basing this on other reviews) and so I don't have to deal w/ fingerprints
##The best news is I've developed the pictures I took w/ this phone and they came out great!
[t] Not a bad phone
##I traded in a Nokia phone for the KRZR a few weeks ago
sound[@]##The KRZR doesn't drop as many calls as the Nokia, but in the areas where the Nokia typically dropped calls, the sound quality on the KRZR is terrible
##At least it's better than having the call dropped
##The KRZR synchronized over bluetooth using iSync on my Macintosh without any trouble at all, so I was happy about that
##I also bought a 2Gb SD card for it which I was able to load songs onto over bluetooth so I didn't need to buy a USB cable or SD reader
##The Nokia had a nice feature where I could set the phone to beep once when it rang
##This was good in meetings
##Haven't figured out how to make this work on the KRZR yet
##This phone is advertised as an MP3 player, but the adapter to connect regular headphones to it is not included
##I see that I can order it from Amazon for abou $5, but none of the cingular stores I've gone to have it
##A slightly annoying thing about the phone is that no games come with it
##Or I should say, all the games are just trial versions which let you play for a minute and then ask you to buy the upgrade
##I don't have a data plan with Cingular, so I have no idea how much it would actually cost to download games or music from Cingular since I believe you pay buy the byte when you don't have a plan
[t] Excellent phone
##CNET gave this phone a less than stellar review, but they utterly missed the point
##Not everyone wants a phone/computer/camera/e-mail retriever/Klingon translator/backhoe/satellite TV
battery[@]##Some of us just want a dependable phone with outstanding battery life, solid reception that doesn't drop calls and sounds good
##This sturdy little unit does all that with aplomb, takes bearable pictures, has a very decent speakerphone, is bluetooth capable, and has PTT for those so inclined
battery[@]##I weathers abuse well and the battery life runs circles around every cell phone I've had previously
##If you want a phone that does everything under the sun, but none of it very well, this is not the phone for you
##If you're intent on a phone that is an outstanding phone, this unit should be on your list
[t] An affordable phone with all the great features!
##I've had this phone for 2 days now and I do feel that the product description provided by cingular wireless was accurate
##I researched extensively the week before I bought this phone to find a phone that would have all the cool and necessary features
##Frankly, I was a bit disappointed upon my initial search b/c all the phones had some elements but not all the elements I was looking for in a phone
##Even the Motorola Razor fell short in several categories
##On November 1st I check Cingular's website and came across this phone
##It not only had all the features I wanted but was priced well too
##Upon receiving the phone and using it I am still not disappointed
##It has lived up to its description
##I feel very good about owning this phone for the next 2 years
##I also purchased the 1 Gig mem card on AMAZON! Get it here! It's way cheaper than Cingular's website!!! The memory card is very cool and works great
[t] Lots of features. A solid product.
##I have had this phone for two weeks (Ebay), and am very happy with it
sound[@],battery[@]##As others have noted, battery life and sound quality are excellent
##Voice dialing works very well, as well as blue tooth function
##Icon clearly identifies whether info is stored on phone or SIM card
##Another plus is that back light time can be extended
##Some may find the phone a touch thick and heavy, but it is too good not to overlook these potential drawbacks
[t] WOW!!! What a phone!
##I am happy! I finally found a cellphone that can handle my workenvironment
##I work outdoors most of the time in noisy conditions, andmy Motorola V3 Razr just wasn't making the grade
battery[@]##I needed a good,basic phone that is TOUGH, has good battery life, and is loud enough tohear and be heard on
##When I need to talk to someone, I don't give adarn about how small or "cute" a phone is, or about extra features likewalkie-talkie capability, web-browsing, or how many mp3 music files aphone can store
##The Motorola V365 meets and exceeds my needs
[t] A little big, but durable and reliable
##This phone is not as fancy as other phones I have seen
screen[@],camera[@]##The screen is not great like with Samsung, the camera is not very good and it doesn't have an MP3 player
##However, I don't have a LAN line and I use my cell phone A LOT
##So, I needed a phone that was reliable and would not break easily -- this phone is good for that
##It is basic, but works well
##PROS1
##Good reception
##I have had one dropped call, but I normally have four bars
##2
##Sound quality is clear and loud
##3
##Durable
##Phones like the Razer feel and look like they will crack/shatter if they are dropped
##This phone feels like it can be dropped a few times and will still work
##4
##Simple menu
##5
battery[@][u]##Good  life
##6
##Really good speakerphone
##The speakerphone mic is really big on the back of the phone and it is loud
##CONS1
##This phone is thick
size[@][u]##It is not huge, but the pictures on Amazon do not really show how big the phone is so you should look on another site and see it being held in someone's hand or a good side view to understand its 
##2
button[@]##I don't like the Push To Talk feature because I will never use it, but the button is on the side of the phone and I keep thinking it is a menu or volume button
##Whenever you push it, the phone will ask if you want to "turn on" the PTT feature
##3
screen[@]##The inside screen is a little small
##4
##I wish it came in other colors
##All in all, this phone is a great choice if you really need a good phone and can live without all the extras
size[@][u]##My biggest problem with this phone is really the 
##However, while it is a bit bulky, it isn't very heavy
[t] This phone is great all-around
##I bought this phone straight from Motorola over a month ago now, and I haven't regretted one minute of it
##It took me a week or so to adapt to Motorola features after having Nokias prior, but now it's smooth sailing
##The speakerphone others have talked about is awesome - I have Bluetooth, but often I'll just click the speakerphone on in the car and talk easily
##I suppose the phone is bulkier than most nowadays, but that really doesn't matter to me since I appreciate a phone I can handle and not feel like I'm going to break in half
##I can honestly say there's nothing I don't like about my Moto
[t] Tough
##I've had this phone for almost a week, and so far I am very pleased with the performance
##It's a little thicker than most flip phones, but seems a lot more durable
##My previous phone was the V220, and the transition to this one is seamless
camera[@][u]##This phone has everything I was looking for, bluetooth, mp3 capability (with purchase of micro-SD memory card),  (VGA) with video capability
##I used the phone mostly to check e-mail, but calls I've made with the phone are clear and loud
sound[@][u],service[@]##The duplex speakerphone is clear and loud, the music tones  great! This phone also has Push-to-Talk capability (optional, service plan required), which if it's not used, doesn't get in the way
##The phone has 5mb of storage built in, plenty for pictures and sounds
[t] moto v365 has 2 versions
##I love my v365 however it took a while to locate its mp3 player due to it being a different version than the v365 shown in a demo on the motorola site
##I purchased mine through ATT and they advertise that its not an mp3 phone although it IS
##(see moto site for more specs and info) My mp3 player is located under sounds as "playlist"
##You need the memory card to store music due to the phone's small 5mb memory
software[@][u]##Moto advertises that you need the phone tools  to download music but I simply inserted my card into an SD adapter that came with my 3-in-1 memory card then inserted it into my pc's card reader and began opening mobile>audio file then dropping ripped music files into the audio file
##On the other version of v365s, there is a DPA (digital audio player) under the games/appl
##area
##I don't know why the mp3 players are in different locations but maybe this will help someone when they open it
##I love the loud speaker and great signal that I always have
battery[@]##I also love the long battery life
##I don't use the PTT as I thought so no comment on that
##If you don't want it,don't use it
##Overall, this is an excellent and sturdy phone
design[@]##I love the bulk design
##I don't have to worry about it slipping from my hands
##Other than the difficulty locating its mp3 player, this is an excellent phone
##This is my first moto
##I might just stick with them a while
[t] Excellent Phone
##Solid phone
##I've yet to have a dropped call
##Bluetooth connects effortlessly
##The feel of this phone is most excellent
##These other thin phones and my big hands don't blend well
##I like the feel of the v365 in my hand
##I can't say enough good things about this phone
##I have had RAZR's, L2's, E62's, and Treo's
##this is my favorite phone ever
[t] mostly good, a little bad
##Firstly, this is a good phone
battery[@]##It's durable, decent battery life, and good features
sound[@]##The sound quality is also very good
##The bluetooth is great
##Now my gripes
software[@]##You have to pay extra for the software to connect the phone to your computer
##I can't believe this is not included right out of the box
button[@][u]##The PTT (push to talk)  is in the worst place ever and is always getting accidentally pressed
service[@]##This is particularly annoying because PTT is a pay service
##It is a fat phone too, and wont fit in the cell phone pocket in my pants
camera[@]##The camera is so-so, but not unusual for most phones
##All in all, I am moderately satisfied with this phone
software[@]##It's big, and no software was included, but it is reliable and durable
[t] Great no-frills phone!
##I've had this phone for about a year and a half, and it is easily the best that I've had so far
##What I like the most about it is the DURABILITY; Its been slammed/tossed/dropped etc and has not once failed
camera[@][u]##The  functions well enough for my use (usually texting images)
##Internet use is a bit chunky, but I've been able use google maps well enough to direct myself around a few times
##Battery life is good, I still get 3-4 days on a charge with normal use (never off)
##Texting is OK, though sometimes it slows when texting fast
##My only dislike is the USB plug
##Its akward to remove if you don't have manicured nails or a knife
##Overall, if you're looking for a good, durable, cheap, depenadble work phone without all the extra junk, this is it
[t] decent basic phone
sound[@][u],battery[@]##best of all the basic phones i've had, good battery life,  quality, never drops a call, sturdy (i'm hard on phones), functionaly pretty good
##If your looking for a decent basic phone that wlll last this is an outstanding phone
##My only wish is that it had a GPS chip
[t] Above average basic phone
##Pros
[t] Nice Phone
##I have had the phone for over a week now
##My old one was Nokia 6010 so this is quite an upgrade
battery[@]##It has great reception and call quality and the battery does last and last
camera[@]##The camera works well as well as all the features
##I have not tried the blue tooth yet
##It does use a different charger and usb connector then the old Motorola's
##My only gripe is it is a thick phone
##It does fit well in my hand but somewhat bulky when attached to my waist
##Overall I like the phone alot and will keep at least 2 years if not longer
[t] not as advertised
##I chose this phone because I wanted an MP3 player and the blue tooth feature
##Also, it had good reviews for the mp3 player, the bluetooth and as a durable good working phone
##So far, it works very well and the blue tooth function is excellent as well
software[@]##After purchasing a micro memory card and the motorola software so I could make the most out of the mp3 player I was ready to attempt to learn how to use the player
##The only problem was, I couldn't find it in the phone
##After checking the motorola website and following step by step directions for the V365 phone I learned that my V365 phone was notthe same
##No MP3 player
##When I called Amazon about it they (to their credit) immediatedly sent me a new V365 phone assuming mine was defective from what I told them
##It turned out to be the same phone with no mp3 player
##It appears that some V365 phones do have the mp3 player
##If that is a feature you want, make sure it comes with your phone before you commit to the contract
[t] Pleased with my purchase
##I recently got this phone after a friend told me that he was getting 5-7 days in between charges
##It is absolutely true
##I have only had to charge it about every 5-6 days with moderate use
##The phone is a good basic phone that works well so far and feel good and sturdy
##So far so good
[t] Terrific!!
##Pros
[t] Motorola v365 -- good deal
##Phone has very good features that you WILL use
[t] Very good basic phone
##I've had this phone for a little over two months
##Here is my breakdown of the phone
[t] Maddening operating system and menu navigation, but outside of those...
##Nice little phone with a DUMB navigation scheme
##You really have to wonder who believed that having to repeatedly push EXIT or BACK rather than being able to ascend to the top of the menu tree was a good idea
##Overall a nice little phone aside from its menuing system
service[@]##AT&T; doesn't seem to be pushing its PTT service much at all, which is a shame
##Compared to the Sony Ericcson T637 I used for years the OS on this phone is severely lacking and counterintuitive
##The V365 does everything up to and including burping the baby and re-enameling the kitchen sink, but ALL I REALLY WANT IS A SIMPLE, RELIABLE PHONE, GUYS, HONEST
##Packing a phone with a camera, video camera, earwax scraper, shoelace untie-er, et cetera becomes annoying after a certain level, and we passed that level in the year 1999
##I don't WANT a pocket computer, I want a cell phone
##Identify and imprison the engineer(s) responsible for the dumb menu structure so they can't repeat their crime
[t] Finally a cell phone that does what a cell phone should do.
##I've been using cell phones now since the "bag phone" first came out, and have seen phones go from great tools, to too small, and now, every gimmick you can think of
##This phone does what technology should bring
##After living with Nokia for the last couple of years, I'm back with Motorola, and so glad
battery[@]##Great reception, easy to hear, battery life is unreal compared to smaller phones, intuitive menu and great features
##Bluetooth works great
##With a memory card I resized my favorite photos and put them in my phone
size[@][u]##It is bigger than most flip phones I've had, but I actually like the  now that I've used it for some time
##I hope they keep making this one!
[t] Terrible user interface
battery[@]##I chose this phone because I wanted something sturdy, with good battery life, and that had excellent reception
##I wasn't looking for a lot of bells and whistles
##I will say that this phone does deliver on all of those points
##But when it arrived there were two crucial aspects to it that made it a deal-breaker for me
##First, I find the user interface on this phone to be terrible
##This is not my first cell phone, but it is my first time with AT & T so, I'm not sure how much of the user interface is AT & T's fault and how much is a problem with the Gibraltar, but I cannot figure out how to accomplish the most basic tasks without consulting the user manual
##I've had the phone now for two months, and I've read the manual from end to end
##Things like 'how do I get the tone for the phone's calendar reminders to be louder and in a different ring?' are just baffling to figure out
##I even called Motorola because I was getting nowhere--and missing reminders because I couldn't hear them
service[@]##The instructions Motorola gave me didn't match the operating system for the phone--they couldn't help and suggested I mail the phone to a service center (not an option because I have no land line and would be without a phone)
##I *finally* figured out (after hours of my precious time) how to change the ring tones, but, like so many other features, if I ever wanted to do it again, I'd have to dig out the instruction manual--or, if that was not help just spend heaps of time trying to find the solution through trial and error
##My last phone--an LG with US Cellular--was simple and trustworthy and very user friendly after a week of getting used to it
##I kept hoping that I just needed to acclimate myself to the new phone
##But, I've decided it's just a terrible terrible operating system
##My husband agrees
##Every time he picks it up and tries to do anything, he's baffled too
##My second gripe is that it's big
##Really big
##Very thick
##You can't get this into your pants pocket
##I read the reviews, I knew it would be larger than my last phone
##I didn't think that was going to bother me much, but it does
##It really bugs me, in fact
##Now, the biggest problem with this situation is that Amazon won't give me a replacement phone in another model
##I just assumed that when you got a cell phone plan with Amazon that you had 30 days to try it out and get something different if you change your mind (just like through AT&T; directly)
##Not so
##They sent me a replacement Gibraltar--but there was no difference--same operating system, same problems
##Now, they tell me I could cancel the plan and return the phone and then sign up again directly through AT & T -- but, that would leave my husband and I without any phones until the new plan was set up
##Not an option for us
##So, I'm stuck with the thing
##If I want a different phone, I'll have to pay for it--full fee
##*sigh*So, my advice to you is if you're unsure if you'll really like a phone once you get it--don't use Amazon
##com
##Buy directly through AT &T; so you can return it if you change your mind
##At the very least, visit a shop and really try a phone out before going back to Amazon to select your phone
##Me, personally, I'd never ever use Amazon
##com again for setting up a cell phone plan
[t] The best mobile phone I ever owned, but not for everyone
##I love this phone
battery[@]##It is sturdy, great reception, great speaker phone, very loud ring, bluetooth, long battery life
##Everything 'I' want in a phone
##With that said
camera[@]##If you want light, thin, great QWERTY keyboard, touch-screen, awesome camera and use for interent, emails, messaging, etc
##, this is not the phone for you
##I don't use this phone for anything except talking, and I have had it for almost 3 years
screen[@]##Some minor scratches on the screen over time, but I don't keep in a case, and am rough on the phone
##Very rugged
##Love it and will miss when it eventually dies
[t] Great durable phone
##I have had this phone for 2 years and it has been great
battery[@][u]##Very durable, easy to hold and doesn't slip out of your hands, and the  lasts forever without charging
##Now that my 2 years is up I need a new one and I hope I can purchase this same model again!
[t] Tough phone!!!
##Bought this phone for my wife, as I was looking for a durable one that could withstand being dropped frequently
battery[@]##The v365 has stood up to that well, even from a ladder! But, we didnt know HOW tough it was until it went through a complete wash cycle in her jeans pocket! It came apart, mind you- the battery cover came off, the battery came out- even the sim card was loose in the wash! Boy, was she upset at the loss of her phone!Well, we dried it out for 3 days, put it back together, and to our amazement, it works fine!Call quality is as good as ever, and the speakerphone is well above average
[t] hmmm-upgrades!
##I owned the original v3
camera[@]##It was fine but no video camera
##I dropped it, got a newer version
##It was even better
##Now I have the V3xx
##It is by far the best phone i have owned
##The new 3G technology is great
##The ease of use and the connectivity speed is awesome
##The only problem I have encountered
##I cannot use the old batteries from my V3i
##The same phone charger can be used on this phone
##I transfered pics taken from an old phone the nokia 3200, they look better on the V3xx
##Memory capacity is greatly increased, the phone uses a micro sd card
##Of course it is also an mp3 player
##If you do not plan to use the new technolgy, just stick to your old phone
##This is a great addition to the ATT family of products
##And no I do not work for ATT, although I should
[t] Best Phone I've Ever Owned!
##I've had this phone about a month now, and it's the best phone I've ever owned
##I am able to get full reception in places where I used to have to go outside to get a signal at all
##I just downloaded some graphics and tones with a data cable for the first time today, and all was great once I figured out that you had to change the connection from memory card (came set that way) to data cable
##I haven't installed a memory card yet, but that's next on my list
##The graphics on the wallpapers are really sharp
battery[@]##I bought a grey V3xx for my boyfriend and had to exchange it because it kept shutting off (the battery seemed not to fit tightly), but the new one hasn't skipped a beat and he loves his, too
##The voice recognition feature is fairly good, but the biggest thing for us is the improvement over our old V3's in the reception quality
[t] Like the razr
##Not sure that I like the fact that it's slighlty larger than my old razr, but the upgrades are worth it
##The 3G is definitely a faster connection than the old Edge (I use my phone as a data connect for my laptop)
##Although I haven't actually needed to store anything to the SD card, I like that I have that option, which my old razr did not
##I like the razr overall, and decided to get another one instead of some of the other 3G options, and that was my main reason for the phone upgrade in the first place, because I like that I can slide it into my back pocket easily and it doesn't totally stand out
[t] My Phone
##I love this phone
##I have not had any problems and it works great
sound[@]##The sound levels are great
##The quality is not a problem at all
software[@]##I have purchased the software to go woth Motorola and that has made it easier to load all of my phone book
##The program makes using my phone as easy as waling down the hall
##It is a great phone for even my 11 yr old
[t] Pale Face Moto
##My first impression when I saw the phone in person was that I had never seen a more pale shade of gold
##But of course that is a subjective issue
battery[@]##The real problem was that the battery would never charge more than one bar, and then go down; I had to send it back
##Amazon promptly refunded the cost
##I then purchased the same model in a different color from another AT&T authorized dealer
##It was almost free with two year contract extension
service[@][u]##(I want phone  anyway and there's no discount for not taking the phone
##) The new one charges properly
##The first one may have been a fluke
##Motorola has fixed a couple problems that the old V3 models had
##(I had five V3 models) 1) On the V3 phones, when I used blue tooth, the I
##D
##ringers would switch to default ringer
##2) The blue tooth would shut off and the phones would hang up when the phone was within 50 feet of an operating microwave or a 2
##4 gigahertz wireless device
##The V3xx is not bothered with these problems
##One strange occurrence though, once when I changed batteries, the phone lost my pictures from the phone's internal memory
##The factory sample pictures remained in the internal memory and the micro SD card memory was not effected
##So far it hasn't done it again
##Contrary to one other report, this phone can use a 2GB card
camera[@]##On some settings the camera displays pictures with a purplish cast compared to the old V3
##Changing the setting seems to improve it
##The phone's music player works well, but certain bass notes are distorted and I've tried different headsets and compared the same music and same headphones on a Sansa MP3 Player and it was not distorted
##Once when connected to a Motorola S9 Wireless Stereo headset, the right channel and right controls went dead
battery[@]##I thought the headset had failed, but discovered that after removing the phone battery and then restarting the phone, the functions were restored
##(Like rebooting a computer?) So far, another one-time occurrence
##The phone section has performed wonderfully and as you could guess, I really like the Razr styling
[t] LOVE IT!
##I love this phone! It's one of the best phones I have ever owned and I would suggest it to anyone! I've been with every phone company and Cingular is my favorite
##This phone, because of being G3, gets reception anywhere!
[t] at least it's pretty...
##The Man(tm) and i renewed our contract with pacbell/cingular/cingularatt/cingular/att just recently
##i've been hankering for a new cell phone (since i lost my previous one and was using one my friend gave me, which was older than Methuselah) and was willing to shell out the coins for this gorgeous gold razr
##and lucky me, unless you live in compton and have a deft desire to either be shot to death for carrying something so pimpalicious or is one yourself, i'm probably one of the only few non-ghettolistas who will be carrying this beauty for the next two years
##well, okay, so perhaps a few wanna-bes will want to carry it too
##probably one of those useless dolts living in the thick of orange county - you know, driving enormous SVUs (still), going to their get their nails done every thursday between matilda's ballet practice and mason's taekwondo training, getting "homemade" dinner from whole-food's prepared meal section, wearing tons of juicy couture as if it's really
##couture
##- yeah, well, they might carry these too in due time
##but not only as an official resident but also the honorary empress in the land of poonty-crack between LA and OC, i will probably be one of the first one to carry this
##and i must say, after all that unnecessary rambling, that it's a sweet piece of
##stuff
##it looks pretty
##it matches my new highlights
##this is the first that that both The Man(tm) and i do not have the exact same phone either
##(we've got the family plan thingie
##) i paid $99 for my gold razr
##he paid nada for his samsung sync
##(they just received it only 2 weeks ago at our local best buy!) and he got the last red one too
##if you're into the pretty thing and reallllly want this phone, go for it
##it's tight
##makes you feel all pimpalicious and wanna say that you're on first name basis with the boys from miami ink
##whatev
##and in comparison to the sync, it's definitely sleeker looking and
##well, it's gold, for crying out loud!!!but that sync's got some vibe
##mine has 1
##3 megapix - whoopdee doo
##until you see his sync, which has 2
##the memory card? mine only takes up to 1 gig - his can take up to 2
sound[@]##sound quality? his kicks major horchata
##so
##er
##mine is pretty!!!if i can somehow merge the fabulousness of the gold razr with the inner beauty of the sync, i think it'd be a perfect phone
##however, isn't that like that one GE advertisement? i have to wait until beauty and brains merge one day
##point being? if you like pretty but less than substantial offering, go for the razr
##if you want supergizmo that has a tip-calculator (!!! how effin' important is THAT?!!??! i used that function in my last LG like crazy!!) and the world currency converter
##don't get the razr
##you know which one i'm talkin' about if you want all that technogeeko goodness
[t] I'm disappointed
##I switched from Nokia 6010 to this Motorola V557 and I am really disappointed
##When I had the Nokia, if I only had 1 of 2 of the total 5 signal bars, I still had very clear converstaion
##Now, even with 3-4 of signal bars, I could not even hear the dailing tone clearly, not to mention the bad quality of the voice converstaion
[t] nice phone bad display problems
##This is my second phone of this type
screen[@]##The first one was replaced under warranty when the screen went black
##11 months later and boom it did it again
##They do not extend the warranty after you've had it replaced so now I'm stuck
##It's a great phone but only good for about a year before you run into problems
camera[@]##The camera and video features are easy to use
##The speakerphone works well
##The browser stuff is ok but takes a long time to connect and is hard to navigate
ringtones[@]##I'm not thrilled with saving the phone numbers to the phone itself in order to customize ringtones
battery[@]##It has had a good battery life and clear reception
##I'd really like this phone if it'd last longer than 11 months
[t] Very good workhorse of a phone
##Bought the v557 about 5 months ago from Cingular's website and overall very pleased
##A great no-nonsense make-and-take calls cell phone
##Features I like
[t] Bloody awful
##I've had this phone for a little more than a year
##From the start, I've had problems with it, and now it's just getting worse
##In the beginning, it would just randomly drop calls
##One minute, the reception would be just fine
##Next minute
##bam! Nothing
##I would be standing in the exact same place and the signal would mysteriously vanish
##Overall, I don't think it gets great reception
##Sometimes moving it just a few inches makes a difference between four bars and zero
##I also think the audio volume doesn't go high enough
##I have a very hard time hearing someone on the other end if I'm walking on a busy street or anywhere else with a lot of background noise
##My previous two phones were much better in that area
##I'm also having problems now that others mentioned
battery[@]##the charger doesn't always make good contact (you have to fiddle with it), and the battery life has become almost nil
##I don't use my phone that much but it will lose all its charge in the course of 24 hours, even if I haven't made any calls
##AT&T; (or Cingular or whatever they are these days) offered to replace it, but I didn't want the same model because I had a friend who also experienced a lot of problems with this phone
##Cingular wasn't willing to give credit for a different model (at the time, the phone was only about six weeks old), so I've kept this one, but next week, I'm changing to Sprint
##And I'm getting a Samsung instead
[t] Decent phone!
##Aside from the carrier, this is a decent phone
##Chock full of options (incl
##Live Ticker), this phone is very user friendly
##I've been using it since January of this year and found that call quality, ring volume and text capabilities are clear, loud & easy to use respectively
##The feel of the phone is soft, yet durable
##The display is crisp and easy to see
##I don't use the Ticker because it's too busy and slightly annoying
##As one reviewer previously stated, this phone is good for phoning
##My second Motorola (the first was a V600), I am very happy with it and recommend it to anyone looking for a quality phone
[t] A Winner
##The Motorola V557 is the best phone I've owned
##I've had this phone since its introduction and I haven't had one problem with it
##This is the best, most reliable and durable phone I've seen
battery[@]##Of course it doesn't have all the latest entertainment features like mp3 capability or video but all those excess features are just a waste of space and battery
##You wont be disappointed with this phone
[t] TRIED AND TRUE
##I owned the Moto v-551 for almost three years
##I liked it so much I resisted the free upgrade! Then I saw the v-557
##but it was being discontinued so I had difficulty finding it
screen[@]##I found one at radio shack and I am thrilled with it! Black instead of the dark blue and a flat metal finish instead of the brushed metal, along with additional features, better audio, sharper screen and a much better camera! If you are not a bells and whistles person and want a substantial quality phone that doesn't feel like a toy then this is the phone for you
[t] Feature packed
##This replaced my V180 which would freeze overnight
##The front display would keep the time it stopped working
##RadioShack-$18 activation + tax with contract renewal
##Pros
[t] short battery life
##I had this phone for almost 2 yrs now
##Everything works, bluetooth, good if you have a headset or car with the option
battery[@]##But the down side is the battery life is very short, 10 -12 hours standby
battery[@]##I replaced the battery already once, but it is the same thing
##Also the volume key at the side is very sensitive to touch, so if you put it in your pocket, it get moved around, your volume setting of the ringtone or rington style will change
camera[@]##Several times I missed the call because it changed to vibrate by itself!? The camera works well
battery[@]##Overall a solid phone, but please provide longer battery life
[t] Best phone I have ever owned...
##This is the most rugged phone I have ever had
##Does not succumb to drops and bumps
##Excellent voice clarity and very easy to program
##Internet capabilities and texting are easy to use
##My husband ran over it and broke the LCD part off of the number pad and I could still make calls on speaker phone
screen[@]##Note* the LCD screen no longer worked
[t] Durable
##I have never been one to be hard on my electronic devices, with the exception of expecting a lot out of them
##From the beginning I had a few problems with this phone - mostly with the speaker and charger
battery[@]##My previous phone was also a Motorola, and my brother had the V551, so I already knew Motorola's are horrible as far as charging the battery
##The connection becomes loose over time and you have to jiggle it, then carefully place the phone down without bumping the connection
##My phone had issues also with the speaker, at least I assume that's where the problem lies
sound[@]##Mine could never properly play music tones, and over time my regular midi tone I had downloaded began to sound distorted
##Of course, Cingular/AT&T; was not helpful, only telling me that "that model has problems"
##Aside from those problems, I give the phone 4 stars because of recent discoveries
##I upgraded to the Nokia 6126, but after having for less than an hour, decided I'd rather have my faulty Motorola than that cheap Nokia plastic "toy"
##There are more options and settings with Motorola phones, especially when it comes to the address book
##If you've only ever had a Motorola, like me, you take some of the options for granted, assuming they are available on most phones
##The main thing is the ability to sort your contacts by speed dial number rather than alphabetical
##This might not matter to some people, but when most of your calls are to someone whose name is far down the alphabet, that "sort by speed dial" is very convenient
##Motorola's text entry method "iTAP English" is another thing I took for granted
##It is SO much better than the old tap-tap-tap to enter a single letter
##The other reason I gave this phone 4 stars is because of how durable it is
##In the last few days the phone had been getting worse, which is why I figured it was time for an upgrade
##In frustration over the year and a half I had the phone (which was only bad within the last couple of months) I have thrown it or slammed it against the wall a few times
##The worst one being when it landed in my cats' water dish, yet the phone still works
button[@]##The button which tells that phone it is closed is now sticking, but other that that the phone survives, and is working quite well
##After the Nokia incident, I think I may just ask AT&T; if I can have this one fixed or replaced with the same model, but a new phone, since it is much better than the current phones they offer
[t] The workhorse of cell phones.
##I've had the V551 for 2 years and it was such a great phone that I just had to buy one for my son who is extremely hard on cell phones
##He's in college and loves this phone after going through various razors and V220s
##The V557 is an upgraded version of the V551 which I have dropped on cement floors a dozen times
##The V557 is very clear, reliable and user friendly
camera[@]##For myself, I just traded the old workhorse in for a Sony w810i which has a better camera and MP3 player
##I love the Sony for it's great features, but it will be hard to beat the V557 for it's tried and true reliability and great call reception
[t] This is what a phone should be!!!!!
##I love this phone! Don't let others influence you to get the latest Razr or even the Samsung D807, because they are only flash
##This phone has the substance that those previously mentioned lack!Leave your music to an actual mp3 player
camera[@]##Use a digital camera for your pictures! So many manufacturers are forgetting that a phone is meant for calls!! The reception on this phone is a force to be reckoned with
[t] Good but not great
##I did a lot of research on a replacement for my late, lamented Motorola v120, and this seemed like the one that would suit me best
##I've been using the phone for a year now, and I have to say that this is a good phone, but it is quirky
##In general, it seems to be a very decent, serviceable piece of equipment and has survived the usual rough treatment, including being dropped and flipped off a table by my cats, with no ill effects
##From what I have seen, it is sturdier than the more-popular Razr phones
##On the positive side, it fits my hand better than my old phone - yes, I think you can have a phone that's too small, and the old one was just that
##I like the camera, though it seems to change picture settings according to some arcane criteria of which I have no understanding - some of the pictures are very good candidates for blowing up, and others are not, and there seems to be no particular reason for this
##On the down side, it occasionally shuts itself off for no particular reason, usually just after a call has ended
battery[@]##The worst problems seem to be with the battery
[t] Great phone compact but easy to use
##Purchased this phone a month ago and quit using my old Nokia
##It took me a little to get used to the buttons but now I love it
##And I went to the local Radio Shack and got one of those bluetooth ear things for answering the phone in the car and I love it too
##I am over 50 and if I can you it you can
##The buttons are big enough and a little raised compared to the Razor so you can really tell what you are doing
internet[@][u],button[@][u]##The only draw back I can see is the ticker thing is close to where the hang up  was on my old Nokia and I have hit some charges for hitting the ticker and going on the  when I did not mean to
##Younger people probably would not have a problem with that
##I live in a remote rural location and travel through several dead spots
##The reception has been the same in all cases as the Nokia
##And it is smaller and cuter and takes pictures! Its fun so go get one!
[t] It seems to work well for everyone else
##Maybe we're just really hard on our phones, but my mother and I both had problems with this phone
screen[@]##My mothers phone suddenly started dropping a lot of calls, the screen broke and one day a huge, spreading crack appeared in it
##She swears she never dropped it, what started out looking like a minor scratch ended up breaking the phone nearly in half
##Our warranty covered it and she got a new phone, the same model
##She hasnt had any problems with the new one yet
##Mine has a terrible habit of turning off and on whenever I open it, which means that whenever someone calls they get hung up on
##It also makes it difficult to check my missed call list
battery[@]##Every now and then it freezes and I have to remove the battery to get it to turn off so I can turn it back on again
##I cannot hear any phone calls unless I put it on speaker
##Another problem we have both had is with the charger
##We have gone through several of them because they tend to wear out and bend up so they no longer hook in the phone
design[@]##It is not a very efficient design
##I suppose my warranty will cover my phone now so I could have it replaced, but considering all the problems my mother and I have had with this phone, I think I'd rather fork over the money to get myself something that isn't a Motorolla
##Besides, with all these tiny new phones out, this one is starting to feel like a brick in my pocket
[t] Really good phone
##I have gone through the Motorola 220, 551, and now the 557
##The 557 is comparible to the 551
##I just think Motorola is the best cell phone product around and this phone offers all I want and more than I will ever probably use
sound[@]##Great sound
size[@]##I like the size
##Not to big but substancial enough to make you feel you have a solid phone
##Like motorolas it is easy to navigate, but maybe I'm just use to that
##I would highly recomend this phone
[t] The Edsel of Cell Phones
##My 3rd V557 arrived this week and so far is holding a charge since the last 2 did not and I had to fight with Cingular to swap me out as I was still under warranty
##I had a maximum of 20 - 30 minutes of Talk Time & the Standby Time was 2 - 3 hours requiring me to sit in parking lots plugged into my cigarette charger leading to absolute frustration
##I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN ON MY HOUSE TELEPHONE IN 1968 ATTACHED TO THE WALL INSTEAD OF GOING OUT WITH SUCH AN UNRELIABLE HEAP OF JUNK
##Cingular is aware of both the CASE CRACKING and DEAD BATTERY issues
##Being disabled I'm in a situation where a reliable cell phone is critical, especially now that winter is here
##My first 2 phones from Cingular after I had to migrate from AT&T
service[@]##The service was so bad with my Nokia 6160 and the situation required I buy a Cingular Phone as all my AT&T friends were experiencing the same issues
##Allegations that Cingular was purposely lowering the signals for the AT&T customers in an effort to have 2 year contracts signed and cell phones sold at a profit brought on a Class Action Lawsuit (class action suits still pending, I should have signed up!)
battery[@]##If not for swapping and the incredibly cheap monthly cost that is probably a thorn in Cingulars side over 1000 rollover minutes for under $40 a month I would have already spent $100 on a dependable phone since all the great deals are only meant for New Customers, if this phone malfunctions I will finally be free of this overpriced piece of landfill having been promised another phone and not a Motorola but a comparable phone with all of the features the V557 has, ironically my husband had the very same model and not being cellular savvy thought nothing of the battery issue until I started cross examining the Customer Service Rep & then the Supervisor
##Just last week they were giving these away in bulk to new customers trying to unload them on unsuspecting prey getting locked into 2 years of a battle I've been fighting for 10 months
##Oh and Cingular admitted the problem after I browbeat them pounding away for almost 2 hours
##The MOTOROLA V557 phone stinks!
##I'd even be ashamed to pawn it off on eBay
##I'm just happy I got a quality phone from the competition that is reliable for emergency use but I have so few minutes for the cost I can't use it in the age of Caller ID to keep that bill down
[t] okay at first
battery[@]##I've read about horrible problems with dropped calls and short battery life, none of which I've had
screen[@]##The outside screen does freeze sometimes with a weird rectangle on it
##Also, after a few months, two small cracks appeared on the silver part of the exterior, which have gotten bigger and bigger
##Cingular and Motorola refuse to acknowldge that there is something wrong with the phone - they call it user misuse
##I keep this phone in my purse all day! It's just not a very sturdy phone
##I still have 15 months left on my contract and I doubt it will make it
##At which point, it will be out of warranty and I will have to pay $150 for a new one
##Needless to say, I am not happy with either Cingular or Motorola
[t] Boo to Motorola
##To start out, this phone looks really cool and takes pretty good pictures for a phone
##I'm am now an official Motorola cell phone hater
##I have owned two Nokia phones before this and I loved them, then I got caught up in the looks and at this time Nokia had nothing out really
##The connection on the phone for the charger sucks and it could easily break or (like I'm experiencing) it doesn't hook up right
##The signal is horrible and makes cingular look bad (good thing I've had cingular for years)
##It took a while to get used to because the buttons arranged differently than the Nokias
screen[@]##The front screen on my boyfriends phone broke
##Granted, mine has taken a beating, overall I'm just disappointed
##I can't wait until the iPhone comes out!!!!
[t] A Great Phone for Phoning
##Pros
[t] Very good Phone, Recomended!
service[@]##Topeka, KS, Cingular service
##Just got the phone yesterday, but I've played with it enough now to be pretty pleased with how it is working
##The other reviewer has an axe to grind (he put the same low rating on ALL motorola phones!)Back to this phone
##very nice fit and feel, love the non skid surface it has, and also like that it has some weight to it
camera[@]##Camera is adequate, but not great, but as others say, buy a digital camera to take nice pictures and get over it
button[@]##I do not have a problem with the volume button on the side, but I am able to put it on 'soft' which does not alow you to adjust it from the outside
##Vibrate and other options probably will help, I don't know what someone would do if they need it on loud
##my SO has one also, and we will see how he gets along with his today
##Keys are big and easy to use, the center 'mouse' is very easy to use, personalizing the keys is easy
##Reception is crystal clear, and signal strength is equal to or better than the nokia 6340i that I had (TDMA/GSM quad band phone)I'll know better when I do my 3
##5 hour run to Nebraska in a few weeks, and will try ou the speaker phone then as well
##Both inside and outside screens are nice and clear and easy to read
##I've turned the brightness down to the lowest setting, and it is plenty bright
##The menu is different, but pretty intuitive, I am able to find and personalize most things without the manual
##I'm not taken by the ticker
##on the fence on that one, but I get my news fix from the Net on a computer
##Seems to have quite a few ads on the ticker so far
##bleah
##Acessing the net for the channels on the ticker is very easy
##There is a pause between accessing, but not as bad as my s l o w phone connection at home
##Not much for ringtones, but I'll get it figured out how to add some, hopefully without a ton of money spent
##I'm going to try the blue tooth headset
##haven't yet
screen[@],battery[@]##Checking out the battery life, but there are quiet a few options, screen saving, turning off the ticker, etc that would probably extend it
##like having the options to do that
[t] Love this phone!
##I love this phone! I originally made the mistake of buying the sony ericsson z520a and hated it
##I have always been a motorola fan and always will be
##This phone looks great, has killer reception, and is very well made (it is really solid)
##I am very picky with my phones and this is by far one of the best phones I have had
##My husband is very jealous for he has the new nokia flip phone and is not too happy with it
##I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a quality product that truly shows
##This phone has made me a motorola fan for life!
[t] Solid Phone.
##So, a RAZR is sexy, yes, but let's face it
##Everyone and thier grandma wants a RAZR, and most people will buy it now that it's cheaper
##I really never saw universal acceptance as terribly cool
##Now then, I owned the V300 from Motorola via T Mobile
##I broke it
##The phone was sturdy; I was just a bit of a jerk
##T Mobile on the other hand, was fuzzy, vague, and too costly
design[@][u]##The V556 is an improvement over my past phone, and I love the 
##It also has features similar to a 1st gen RAZR, but hey, you're on Amazon, you can figure that out yourself
##Cons
[t] Motorola fans will like this!
##If you've ever switched brands, you know it can be a challenge
##Adapting to the Motorola V220 flip-phone from a Nokia "candy bar" style phone was OK, but after losing my V220 (no longer available) I tried an LG 1500 and found it unusably alien, its display inferior
##I returned the LG and got this V557
##It's quite a bit more expensive if you buy the phone straight out (I paid $269), but just about worth the extra money
##The display looks like a miniature TV!It loads games noticeably faster than the V220 did although it occasionally hangs for a second or two during play
camera[@]##The video and camera work fine and have more memory
##IT RUNS FAR LONGER ON A CHARGE than any other phone I've had! Wow! Inexpensive car chargers are available at Wal Mart and Target
##Overseas (notably SE Asia), you can just buy another SIM card at a 7-11 store and then you have a local phone number --just call from that to pick up your voice mail at home; it's cheap
##(The 7-11's also have scratch-off cards to "fill up" on usage minutes as you go --no contracts
##)One thing about the Motorolas
[t] Fantastic value for money!
##I lost my RAZR while running errands, and had to get another phone
##A blessing in disguise
##I hadn't loved the RAZR- cool-looking but not terribly useful
##The V557 has Medianet (data interchange costs extra), Bluetooth capability, a decent camera, multi-media messaging, networking including e-mail down and upload, handles data and fax transmissions, has very easy input with the keyboard, a datebook and notepad, and has a FREE ticker display running news and sports headlines
##(You pay extra to download the entire story
price[@]##) This is almost a smartphone without the high price
##It just doesn't look as cool as the RAZR, but neither do I
[t] Good Basic Phone with Excellent Features
##I am a big fan of this phone
battery[@]##I previously owned the *ancient* Sony Ericsson z500a, which I was very unhappy with--EXTREMELY bad battery life, picture quality was less-than-mediocre, but the call quality was good
camera[@][u],battery[@]##So, before I bought my next phone, I was looking for a phone with a good  (one that takes acceptable pictures; you can't expect much from a  phone) and exceptional battery life, as I talk on the phone for around 2-3 hours a day
battery[@]##The Sony Ericsson battery lasted for about 12 hours and then I'd have to charge it
##This phone fit the bill perfectly
battery[@]##Talking 2-3 hours a day plus using the alarm, datebook, and text messaging regularly and the battery lasts for about 3 days (which is more than exceptional for my standards)
camera[@]##The camera takes decent pictures--you can actually make out what the object in the picture is!--and I'm quite satisfied with it
##It also comes with Bluetooth, which I haven't been able to take advantage of but hopefully will in the future
##The datebook is very handy and the alarm system is quite nice; you can set separate settings for several alarms
##The ticker, although marketed with much hype, is not all that great and I disabled it within having the phone for 2 hours
##As far as games are concerned, my phone came with a Bejeweled Demo and NFL Football 2005 Demo
##It irks me that they're both demos, but with phones these days they rarely have complimentary ones available without having to pay
##The text messaging is refreshing compared to my old phone and is very fast, no lag
##Ringtone selection is slim, but viable
screen[@]##In the preferences, you can customize the order of the icons on the menu and what the home screen shows, your background, wallpaper, theme, sounds, etc
##The reception is also quite good
##Summary
[t] So far...so good...
##I picked up my 557 a couple of weeks ago to upgrade/replace my Motorola V220 (good phone, but inherent display problems)
##I had an opportunity to choose a new RAZR but, upon inspection, found it to be a very fragile, flimsy device
[t] Revision of the horrible v551, but a great one!
##I was issued this phone as a replacement for the v551, after sending 3 back under warranty
##So far, the only issue I'm facing on a daily basis is the faulty quick-charge port (one of many issues I had with the v551 phones)
##The connection is loose and the phone will report a full charge, even though the "battery status" selection in the menu says it has only 1 bar
##I'm pretty picky about handling my phones, so I don't just jam the charger tip into the charge port
##Having to position the phone "just right", and then tape the cord down so that it doesn't move even slightly, is a waste of time and very frustrating to hear the "do-do-do"
sound[@]##"de-do-do" sound when it starts, and then immediately ends charging
battery[@]##It also wears out the life of the phone battery
battery[@]##My advice, if you have to have this phone, do yourself and your battery a favor, buy a cradle charger
[t] Decent
##This phone replaced my Nokia 1100, which, believe it or not, survived a full cycle in a washing machine
button[@]##It is way too easy to accidentally access a feature on this phone that will get you charged per use, including a button which brings you to the Cingular Mall
##You can customize the functions of other buttons -- but not for that one
##I've customized it as much as possible to ease this problem
##I've disabled the ticker and reordered menu options
screen[@]##The screen is bigger and image display clearer than phones a year or two older
sound[@],camera[@]##The camera made its annoying click sound even, I think, on silent until I discovered the not so user friendly was to disable it
##None of the games work, but I don't care enough about them to do anything about it
##I don't think anyone else has complained that this phone is noticeably larger than similar phones
##I thought I was so smart to choose the best reviewed free phone from the Cingular website
##I stupidly didn't compare the dimensions
##It is even bigger than at least one of the earlier Motorola V series models
##My Nokia 1100 was a solid but basic phone
##This is my first feature heavy model and I'm having a lot of fun with it, but I don't think it would last a minute with my laundry
[t] The metal frame outside gave a crack
##My wife has this phone, the features are good overall
##The problem with this phone is that the front silver portion on the phone got a crack
##It was not dropped and had been stored always in the purse
[t] Uneven backlight on keypad numbers?
##Just received the V557 and it's charging
##Noticed that the backlight on the keypad is uneven
##The numbers 4,5,6 are much brighter then the other keys, as is the key under the 8 key, The other keys are backlite but not as bright
##Is this normal? Maybe the keys don't have a "light" for each key? Will update this review when I start using the phone
##UPDATE
[t] Needs the phone to unlock
##I cannot get the phone to unlock so i can't use it
[t] Good motorola phone
##I have had several motorola cell phones in the past and they all were excellent
##I had to upgrade my cells last year and got 3 samsung x427 cell phones
##My wife broke hers so this game me an opportunity to upgrade back to a motorola(highly discourage anyone from buying this samsung x427 POS)
##After hours of reviews and researching top rated phones, I chose the motorola v180
##I am so far very pleased with it
##It has excellent volume, since I am hearing impaired unlike my samsung
##It also has 2 other features that I wanted that my samsung did not have;the caller id on the outside and voice dial
##The only negative thing that I have seen so far is the exterior is made of a cheap looking/feeling plastic
##I purchased a Body glove case and this solved my worries about damaging the phone
##Very pleased with this purchase
camera[@]##If you are looking for a camera phone or one that is VERY HIGH TECH, this isnt the phone for you
##But if your like me and want a good quality phone that has what you need for on the road that is very dependable, look no further
[t] A rather unique little phone
##I thought that this phone was crap the first time my sister got it, but then I realized that quality overthrew aesthetics
##So first, when you look at it, yeah you probably thought the same thing I thought
##It's ugly! it looks like a cheap plastic flimsy little piece of crap, right? well, it's actually quite a quality phone, no matter how ugly it is
##The phone is small, thin, compact, and lightweight, which are big plusses on phones these days
screen[@]##The external screen is okay, it's small, monochrome, and easy to see
##basically no more use for it than to see whos calling
screen[@]##When you open the phone up, the screen dissapoints you
screen[@]##Because you have all this space to put a big decent sixed screen and there's this little 1 inch square screen
##I'm not kidding
##it's very small
##I think the earpiece takes up more space
##But anyway, it's for people who want a simple phone, and only a phone
##The keys are great, they are lit up very well, very textile, and easy to press
##Menus are a tad confusing, but you'll get the hang of them
##When you're reading text messages or something it's very easy to read because dispite the screen's small size, it's very bright and clear
##A plus for people who have a hard time seeing small screens
##One thing that really impressed me with this phone is it's speaker
##I thought it was just a basic phone but it also has speakerphone, which is wierd because a small minimal phone like this having speakerphone is a bit redundant, but whatever
##The speaker is located on the bottom, and it really sounds great
##My sister downloaded a real MP3 ringtone on her phone and it sounds like a real radio playing when it's ringing
##Not like those other phones where the ringtone sounds drowned out, it's really loud and soo soo clear
sound[@]##I'm impressed with the sound quality
##The phone is moderately priced, my sister's is a cingular and I think it costed about 50 bucks with the plan after rebates and over 150 without rebates
price[@][u]##Anywho, it's a small simple phone for people who want a quality low-end phone for a low  and not much more
camera[@]##Probably a really reliable phone verses a big fancy camera phone that works better as a camera than it does for a phone
##If you're looking for simple phone and nothing more, look no further
##If you're the type who likes more visual pleasure and high-end featuers, there's better
[t] Great Phone....Horrible Reception
##So here's my story
##I previously owned an LG AT&T; Wireless phone that received what I would grade B reception
##It worked out doors, at work, and most importantly in my condo
##The only problem I had was that there were certain areas in Chicago that when I passed through would drop calls
##This phenomenom also occured in my condo from time to time
##Annoying but tolerable
##I discovered that these dropped calls would occur when my phone was switching from AT&T;'s network to Cingular's network (a result of the new merger)
##I figured that I could alleviate this problem by switching to Cingular and buying a Cingular compatible phone
##Unfortunately my new purchase, the Motorola V180, gets worse reception than my old AT&T; phone
##As of this writing I have had my phone for 3 days and I have been unable to use it in any building in the Wrigleyville area
##I am not sure if this is a Cingular issue or a phone issue but considering my old phone could get reception in these areas and this phone is using the same network, I am very unhappy with my purchase
##Reception put aside (because Yeah, no one needs to be able to actually talk on their phone!) this phone is great in terms of all of the features it offers
##Text, ringtones, etc
##are very easy to use
##Battery life seems great
price[@]##Basically an A+ phone for the price (Free with 2yr contract) with D- reception
##I am going to return this phone (30 day trial period w/Cingular) and hopefully get one that works
##I plan on changing my review if I discover that this is in fact a Cingular issue and not a Motorola V180 issue
[t] don't get it!
camera[@][u]##i got this phone free with a t-mobile plan, and at first was happy--it was a cute flip phone, light & i had fun playing with the features, although it was too bad there was no 
##unfortunately the phone's also very fragile, and after a while i started noticing a lot of static during calls and very poor reception
##i would call people and they wouldn't be able to hear me AT ALL
##lots of dropped calls
##i called t-mobile about it and the tech support guy said he'd had similar complaints about this model from other customers
##it got so bad that i just took the SIM card out and put it in this old nokia phone my dad used to use--clunky & not pretty but the reception & clarity turned out to be MUCH better on this old nokia phone
##now that i'm looking for a new phone & plan, i'm checking out reviews carefully this time
##hope this review is helpful in preventing others from making the mistake of getting the motorola v-180
[t] DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!
##I have four motorola phones, two V180's and two V220's (same as V180 but with camera)
##After the warranty expired on these phones the troubles began
##My daugher's V220 began shutting off for no reason within a few seconds of being turned on
battery[@]##Replacing the battery did not help
##Thinking this was just an anomaly, I decided to replace it with another V220, even though it meant extending the Cingular contract
screen[@]##Everything was OK for a while, then the main screen on my other daughter's V220 began going blank for no reason
##You could still make and receive calls but it was next to impossible to use any other functionality
##Next my wife's V180 would no longer ring
##I had to set the audio option to 'vibrate' in order to have a chance to detect an incoming call
screen[@]##Now, the main screen on my V180 phone has been periodically going blank
screen[@],internet[@][u]##I recently searched the  for reviews on these phones and found numerous complaints similar to my blank screen problem
##I will NEVER purchase another Motorola cell phone again, and I plan to strongly recommend against them for any of my associates who are in the market for a phone
[t] Good phone for the price
price[@]##The v180 is a pretty good phone with a lot features you don't normally find at this price range
##Plus points include
[t] Not toooo bad
##I got this phone in early January of 2005 with a 2 year contract with Cingular
##For the first 4 months the phone was generally pretty good then things started to happen
##I ended up having to send my first phone in and get a new one then it worked great
##So it seems the phone works real well for the first few months then it just turns into a piece of crap
##You will read alot of reviews saying turning the volume down on it is hard because you have to keep clicking, don't listen to them they are morons
screen[@],button[@]##You press the side button once and the volume display comes on the screen then you press the "0" key which will switch it to vibrate
##I just bought the motorola V600 and i read alot of bad reviews on it but so far its working just great, my signal strength is better than the V180 which is a bad problem i had with the phone, before i had to replace it
##Pros - Small and compact, outside caller id and clock, color screen, cool design, good basic phone, very easy to useCons - Casing was very cheaply made, scratched easily even when i had it in a case or clip, antenna wasn't the greatest had frequent dropped calls, buttons too smallOverall the V180 is an All Right phone, it has pros and cons i would recommend it to someone who doesn't need their phone for much maybe only emergencies
[t] Nice phone
##Overall I am happy with this phone
service[@]##I got it with Cingular service and I'm Columbus, Ohio
##It's got all the basic features, plus a few I wasn't expecting
##I have had few problems with dropped calls, and interestingly enough, the only dropped calls I experience are mobile-to-mobile calls with a friend of mine who's also on Cingular
##Other than that, reception has been fine
##What I love
[t] Solid basic phone
##I have had this phone for about two weeks now and I am very happy with it, with one small exception
sound[@][u],battery[@]##The reception has been very clear, the  is great, and battery life has been very good
##These are the only things I care about with cell phones--I don't care about color screens, games, Internet access, text messaging, AIM messaging, pictures, video, yadda yadda yadda
battery[@]##I just want something that sends and receives phone calls reliably and clearly, and has a long-lasting battery
ringtones[@][u]##The one small exception is that I had downloaded a few MP3  because they sounded less obnoxious than the included set of techno/hiphop dance tunes
screen[@],ringtones[@]##Well, unfortunately the MP3 ringtones won't play because apparently there's a little problem in the way the phone recognizes the ringtone's 'filename'--every time I set a person's ring ID to one of the MP3 ringtones, it looks like it was set OK, but when I come back to the info screen for the phonebook entry, the ring ID has changed to whatever the ID used to be, plus '
##mp3' tacked on the end, and now the phone apparently can't find it and plays the default 'ding' ringtone for that entry
##I should add that this seems to be specific to the downloaded MP3 ringtones, because the polyphonic ringtone I got to put on my wife's entry (the Pink Panther theme)
[t] Don't bother... waste of money and rise in blood pressure.
service[@]##This phone is almost worthless with cingular service
##Shortly after I got it, it started dropping calls regularly, even when I was stationary
##Signal strenght would frequently go from full strength on standby to minimal when I made or answered a call
service[@]##All I can think of is that it is cingular's service which sucks, since a friend of mine has the same phone on T-Mobile with no problems on signal strength
##Either go with a different company, or a better phone(don't bother with the freebies from cingular), or keep a VERY close eye on signal strength during the first 30 day trial period
screen[@]##If you wait too long, you'll have to deal with Cingular's less than stellar customer service, where the best trouble shooting they can come up with is "You are in a low signal strength area" even when full strength shows on the dispaly screen
##Needless to say, I haven't been pleased with the phone's performance, so I can't recommend it with cingular
##If you decide to go with the same phone w/ different carrier, then I would say it's a good basic phone
##Easy to use
##The speaker phone is great for when you don't have hands-free kit handy, and the display is bright enough
##Doesn't come with many frills, though
ringtones[@]##No games (only one trial game) and only basic ringtones
service[@][u]##All in all, it's a nice phone, just $h**ty 
[t] v180 great phone
##i own a v180 i have not had the problems that some people have had
##it is a little small but i like it
##it gets a signal every where if you use an antenna booster
##i love the speaker phone it is clear
##overall i like the phone it works well
[t] The Coolest Phone
##I recently purchased this phone and I love it
##It does everything
##You can download games, ringtones, and graphics
##It has a great color screen, and the phone is so stylish
##It is my favorite cell phone out right now
camera[@]##If only it had a camera it would be the perfect cell phone
[t] Sucks !
##Wow
##So my Samsung E715 fell in love with my shotput and got competely smashed
##I went over to tombile and picked up the cheapest flip phone they had at the time
##Yes and this is indeed the cheapest
##I down right hate this phone
##The only reason why i give it two stars is because it can make calls and the speakerphone feature
##1
##Feels very cheap
##Can get scratched easily
##Falls apart2
battery[@]##Short battery life
##If not charged at night, will die the next morning
##3
##Turns off whenever it wants
##I tried taking out the battery, nothing happened
##I will be on the phone and it will randomly turn off
##Dont get the phone
##pitch in the money and get a better phone
##You'll thank me
[t] Deserves 0 Stars
##Unlike some of the upscale phones by motorola, this one is a piece of crap
battery[@]##This is made of cheap plastic and it falls apart and scratches and the battery sucks and its just a horrible phone
##This phone has turned me away from motorola and back on to nokia
##DON'T BUY
##THIS PHONE IS A PIECE OF CRAP
[t] moto almost got it
##Ive had my V180 for about a week and have nothing but good things to say about it, ive even gotten good comments from my co-workers on the phone, the only feature ive found not up to par is the address book, when you enter you info
[t] All downhill after the first few days
##This phone was great at first
##I loved it
battery[@]##The speakerphone is great, battery life was great, reception was as good as Cingular could be
##I love the features of this phone
screen[@]##But after 3 days, the external screen cracked and I have no idea how
##I never dropped it, never hit it on anything
screen[@]##I was using it, looked at the time on the external screen and it was normal, then not even 20 minutes later I checked the time and my screen is cracked! Very wierd
service[@]##I went to my service rep
##and tried to exchange for a new phone
##It took them two weeks to finally decide that I couldn't get another one
##The reception has gotten downright terrible
##If I put the phone in my pocket I pretty much don't get a signal
##Calls get dropped frequently
##I finally took my SIM card/smart chip out and put it in my old Samsung x427 and my signal went from one bar with the V180 to a full signal with the x427 in the same location
##The phone has locked up a few times too
##Couldn't even turn it off
battery[@]##Had to remove the battery
##DON'T GET A MOTOROLA V180
[t] Unreliable Ring, Screen Broke after 8 Months
##I purchased this phone from T-Mobile
##Phone is very lightweight and made of cheap plastic
##After 6 months of ownership, the phone would not always ring
##After 8 months, the phone's color display went dark
##At this point, I could only receive calls - could not make any outgoing calls or use the phone beyond answering incoming calls
##Called T-Mobile and they wanted $10 from me return it for a new one, even though it was under full warranty
##What's more outrageous is they were only going to insure the new V180 for 90 days; they have a lot of faith in it
##Look to purchase a Sumsung instead
##Samsumg phones are made like tanks and will last much longer than the V180
[t] Disappointing
##I picked the V180 relying on CNet's review, and "satisfied" comments from my cousin and boss, both have V180s, the former with AT&T; and the latter with Cingular
##I picked it even though this was not a free phone then
##I have had the phone for four months now
##Updated review after using it in Thailand
[t] Falling apart
##I've had this phone every since it had been released
##its been about 9 months
##i loved it at first, it had all the average normal things i needed on a phone
##and then the vibrate broke
##just one day it stopped working
screen[@]##and now just two days ago the outside screen that shows the time and whose calling is blank
##theres just nothing there
##so now i cant tell whose calling
##and when im in class i cant tell when someone calling without opening it
##it sucks
##dont they make a good solid cell phone any more???UPDATE
[t] Good phone
##I just got this phone yesterday and so far i really enjoy it
##Probably one of my fav things about it is the the buttons, it is almost impossible to mis dial a number
ringtones[@]##I has MP3 ringtones you can dl which is a very cool feature
##Probably the only complaints i have about it is the menu buttons they are small and for someone who has even semi big hands it can sometimes be a hassle pushing them and i have noticed the reception bars constanly move from 2 to 5 it is rare when i have a complete 5 bar reception, but i have not had any problmes with crappy reception yet
##But overall it is a very cool phone and i would reccomend it
[t] Like a Cute Little Wife##I've had this phone for a couple of months now
##I don't like gimmicks, and I won't pay for anything gimmicky, so I settled for this phone
##It's actually not that bad of a phone, considering I've never liked flip-open phones
screen[@]##The ring selection is pretty good, and the color screen is super easy to read
##The speakerphone was the biggest surprise for me and I use it often
##I also like how you can re-assign many of the keys
##Good idea!Now straight to the meat
[t] The cons far outnumber the pros
##There are too many good reviews of this phone so I felt I had to add one more against the V180
##If you can afford it, skip this phone
##Before I go further into the review, I should say that my last phone was a Sony Ericsson T39m, which was top of the line back in 2002 and went through a lot of torture during the 3 years since
##Because of advances in technology, I expect a cheap phone today to at least come close to matching a 3 year old phone
##The V180 comes nowhere close to that
##I should also qualify my review by saying that I have tested many family and friends' phones to confirm that I'm not being overly demanding
##The Good
[t] Buy some thing else
##The worst cell phone I have ever owned
##PLEASE PLEASE dont waste your money on this paper weight
screen[@]##The screen gave problem on day 3, ever since then there has been some kind of problem or the other with this phone
screen[@]##We have two as part of a family plan and both have the exact same problem with the display screen
##I hope Motorola people are reading this
##Never again will I buy ANYTHING motorola
##They just lost a valuable customer
[t] Lousy phone
##I have had 2 of these for nearly 1 year
##One has constantly had terrible reception and drops calls
##The other worked pretty well except for occasional dropped calls, but suddenly the screeen went blank
##It still lights up but displays nothing
##Not a good thing for trying to use the phone book or any other function
##I'm lucky, I think because the warranty expires tomorrow (I think)
##I'm taking them back to Cingular tonight to see what happens
##Avoid this phone at all costs
##I'm going back to Nokia as soon as I can
[t] Good phone UNTIL the screen dies on you!
screen[@][u]##Overall I liked this phone - until a weeks after the warranty expired the  DIED! Yes, folks - the internal  on these phones have a 1 yr lifespan
##Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use it for less then 1 yr!I am not kidding
[t] I like it.
##I got this phone in Feb '05 as a spare for the summer (fold up, nice and small)
##My other GSM phones have been a Sony Ericson 68 something or other, and a Nokia 3200
##This phone is nice and small, and I have no trouble with the buttons, but I have small hands
button[@]##Someone with large hands would probably have trouble with the navigation button in the center
##I read the other reviews, and don't understand why some folks say they only have 2 programmable buttons
[t] Move along...nothing here to see.
##I liked this phone at first
sound[@][u]##Light, comfy, compact, decent 
screen[@]##But then the video screen died
##And it's not just dead, it sometimes comes back to life but it's all wonky
size[@]##The words are backward and the wrong size
##Sent it back to Motorola under warranty, they sent it back saying they couldn't find a problem
##Unless they can read backward or see things that aren't there, I'm not really sure why they couldn't find the problem
[t] Buy Another Cell Phone!
battery[@]##The V180 has good voice quality and long battery life and is nice and compact
##There the positive qualities stop
screen[@]##The inside LCD screen on my phone broke in less then three months with no improper or rough handling
##I put the phone in my pocket
screen[@]##Thirty minutes later I took it out to place a call and the LCD color screen was broken--talk about an oversensitive phone! Avoid this phone; it's not worth it
[t] Terrible phone
##Phone is way over priced and not worth it
##Very poor voice quality, speaker phone is terrible, and get dropped calls all the time
##I've heard the horror stories on Motorola phones and this one proves the stories correct
##Don't waste your time on Motorola phones, espcially this one!!
[t] Trouble with a capital T
battery[@]##My complaint is with the battery
battery[@]##I only had the phone for 1 monthe before the battery started to go out every eight hours
##After six months it would only stay charged for four hours
battery[@]##The reception was great but the battery sucked
[t] GREAT PHONE
##I absolutely love this phone! GREAT reception, GREAT color, real songs for ringtones, the black with blue light up buttons, size, so many features
camera[@]##PERFECT!If all you want is a GREAT phone without a camera
##THIS IS IT go for it
##You won't be sorry
[t] Tough and Ugly
##My girlfriend and I purchased this phone more than a year ago when we renewed our contracts, and I have to say it's been the best cell phone I 've owned yet
##But it's also the ugliest cell phone I've owned
##It has all the features we need caller ID, speed dial, mp3 ring tones, flip design, etc
##But what has suprised us most is how tough it is
##I have dropped it numerous times, some times on to concrete or asphault, and it still works great
##I carry it in my jeans pocket daily and its never gotten more than a scratch
##The real kicker is when my girlfriend dropped it out of the car one day and the phone was run over by another car, after we went back and picked it up, the only thing that didnt work was the caller ID
##So to all you that say it broke easily, you must have been trying to break it
##This is the most sturdy phone I have ever owned
##Great Job Motorola
[t] The first AND last Motorola I have and will ever own
##I bought this phone in Russia, from Megafon, as a mean of communication with my family in the states while being overseas
##The first two weeks I owned the phone it was absolutely flawless, with amenities galore and overall very sleek and good looking
##I have owned several mobile phones, but this was the first Motorola
##I do not consider myself picky about phones, simple functionality suffices just fine - I don't need all the fireworks that come with so many phones, so the V180 looked great for me, a student on a limited budget
##Aside from enjoying the option of speakerphone, something I have never had on a mobile, this phone is a complete piece of garbage
##For the past month now, I have been unable to dial any phone number whatsoever - everytime I even attempt to do so the phone freezes, the backlight turns off, then goes to a black screen, and finally defaults back to the main background saying "No Service" - after which a few seconds pass and it goes back to normal with full signal
##I do not make many phone calls, as airtime is very expensive here, so I was able to get by with text messages locally and receiving incoming calls for a while, but that is ridiculous for owning a phone that you'd think would function! Why would you purchase a phone that you can't call outbound on? Should I want to dial a number, there is no possible way to do so, no way around it - through the phonebook, recent call lists, and even directly dialing the number on the keypad
##The same goes for simply accessing my phonebook, if I attempt to edit the name of a contact in my book, it goes through those same stages and leaves me stranded, like usual
##As my first Motorola, I was excited to purchase something that has the reputation of being high quality, but such a worthless device may as well be branded 'Garbage' as it is simply nothing better
##You will regret purchasing this phone, but certainly not as much as I do, because there is no possible way for me to return it
##The remaining months I am here and stuck with this phone, I will have to text someone and have them call me if I want to talk with them
##I just hope that I never need to make an emergency call! Thanks alot Motorola!
[t] Horrible phone, even if it's free!
##I hate to be overly negative, but my experience with this phone has been less than pleasant!I got it around March or April, mostly to take advantage of free mobile-to-mobile calling
##At first, it worked wonderfully
##I was amazed that a free phone could provide the basics so well, plus a few other things (like alarm) that were just neat
##But recently, it started breaking down on me
service[@]##I may have dropped it once or twice, but this never kept my i860 from providing me with loyal service
##But not this one!When I'm in a call, the reception keeps dying within a few minutes
##It gets to the point where I can't hear the other party and have to hang up and call again
##Also, there are many times when calls cannot be completed, even though there are a couple of bars or so present
##Furthermore, there is a lot of distortion in the audio before it goes out completely
##I don't like leaving a bad review just for the sake of it, but I am really dissatisfied with this phone
##I don't know whether It has reached its lifetime operation limit or not, but what am I to do with 18 months or so still remaining in the contract??For the record, as of writing this review, this phone has had 430 hours and 44 minutes of use
[t] The Phone is so so, the problem is the Provider
##Hi, this is my first review ever of a product
##If you are like i was three months ago, looking for a phone and cell phone provider, be very careful with Cingular
##For the phone a gave 3 stars, but cingular a give less than one
##First, i live in Boston, and believe it or not, there are dead spots all over
##Inside my house are dead spots, and my cell phone is useless
service[@]##Second, have you ever had to cancel an account with AOL? Well, Cingular's customer service are just as bad
##I bought a plan with rollover minutes, and they tell me now that there is not such a plan
##I ask to talk to the supervisor and they tell me she is busy or that she won't be able to do anything for me
##Do yourself a favor and stay away from Cingular!!
[t] Don't even think about getting this phone... or even this company.
##At the beginning of the year I went up to our Town Mall's Cingular store to get myself a better phone, in which the salesperson suggested the v180
screen[@]##The screen broke 1 month later
##3 months later after that, apparently I thought I lost my v180 in the house, but someone stole my SIM card and made $300 of calls to people who had their cell phones stolen as well
##My mother refused to pay the $300 owed to Cingular but will pay for her calls
##The big mistake was we didn't cancel with Cingular after my phone was lost/stolen
##We called the next day just to hear that we have a contract until March 2007, so we can't switch to another phone company and to get a police report, and they will clear all charges
##End of November
[t] HORRIBLE PHONE
##I am on my fourth V180 in 2 months
##I always take care of my phone and it sill breaks
##DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE UNLESS YOU PLAN NOT TO USE IT!!!!
[t] Cingular Deceptive
##My review is on Cingular
##I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used
##THEY LIE
##THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY
##THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR ACTIVATION even though it never worked in my area
##If you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service, DON'T BUY from Cingular
##Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse
[t] Couldn't be more pleased...
##My wife and I each bought one of these phones with our new Cingular contract
##Though we did not buy through Amazon, I thought a review of the phone would be useful to everyone!First of all, these phones are very well designed for the user
##Because it is a flip phone, it is very compact when "closed" yet when it is "open" it feels more like a real phone than most other cell phones do
##The hinge is in no way flimsy and seems like it will hold up well
screen[@]##We love the color screen and various audio/picture options that this phone offers
##We were both able to learn how to navigate the phone's menu system with ease
battery[@]##I am also very pleased with both reception and the battery charge-life
##I charge my phone 1-2 times per week and have not had any problems with "low battery" messages during a call
##My last phone (a Kyocera) was terrible about losing charge very quickly during calls
##Basically, this phone performs as well as the advertisements say it does, and for a lot less than the high-end phones
##We could not be happier with this purchase!
[t] Cheap Phone - Take Away Some Stars!
##I have now had this phone for half a year
##The first few months, it worked ok and I was very pleased
##I gave it 5 stars back then
##I wish I could take a few of them back
##Now, my v180 is unreliable at best
##I can't keep track of how many conversations I've had when all of a sudden they can't hear me
##I try to call back and it's just static
##I have to wait a few minutes while the phone settles down to call back
##What's the point of having a phone if you can only talk on it occasionally, when it feels like letting you stay connected for over 5 minutes?In case you are thinking of getting this, let's go to the Pros
[t] Noted problems seem to be fixed
service[@]##I liked Cingular service (as an AT&T; transplant) but once they started squeezing down TDMA I knew I'd have to go GSM
##I researched a number of review sites, including Amazon, and settled on a MV180 despite reports of persistent problems
[t] Great Phone!
##Like a previous reviewer, although I didn't purchase the phone through Amazon, I still wanted to write a review in the hopes that I can help someone choose a new phone
##With my T-Mobile contract coming up for renewal and my desire to replace my Samsung X-105, I headed to my local T-Mobile store
camera[@]##I already knew that I wasn't particularly looking for a camera phone or anything extravagant
##I just wanted a solid phone that worked
##Initially, I'd intended on getting a Samsung E-105, which was identical to my current phone, aside from being a flip
##I discovered that none of the T-Mobile stores in my area had one in stock, and that it was on the verge of being replaced by a newer model
camera[@],service[@]##Not wanting to spend the extra money on the E-315 (nice, but I don't want to pay for a camera I don't need), I took a look at some of their other flip phones, and settled on the Motorola V180 (for $49 as a service renewal discount
##)So far, I'm very happy with the phone
##The reception is actually better (and clearer) than my beloved X-105
button[@][u]##I was afraid that I'd have to learn a whole different  layout, but it's surprisingly very similar to the Samsung and it took me only a few minutes to figure everything out
##Contrary to many of the reviews that I've read, the plastic does not feel cheap or "plasticky" (I think this has to do with the fact that the plastic on the inside is a matte finish, whereas the outside is fairly glossy
##Some people may mistake that for being "cheaper
##") The phone feels just as sturdy and solid as most any other flip phone that I've looked at (aside from a few phones that are obviously geared towards heavy "construction contractor" use
battery[@]##) It's not as heavy as my X-105, yet has much better battery life, and I have no problems navigating the keys
##I've only found very minor complaints with the phone
screen[@],size[@]##Mainly, the screen isn't quite as nice as the Samsung's, with small details being slighly less well-defined and the overall size being a bit smaller
screen[@]##Considering the amount of real estate on the earpiece, Moto probably could've fit a slightly larger screen in
screen[@]##However, overall the screen is still nice and bright and a side-by-side comparison with my old Samsung doesn't leave me feeling disappointed
##Also, even though the V180 only has a Contrast control, I've found the range of brightness very acceptable and comparable to the X/E-105 phones' Brightness controls
##The only other minor niggle I have is that the phone didn't come with a case or holster
##Most other flips that I've looked at came with at least a holster
##However, this is one of those instances where it "would've been nice, but it's really not that big of a deal
##" Plastic holsters are only a couple dollars and cases aren't that much more
##I did like the fact that it came with an earbud, although I've yet to test that (or the speakerphone function) out
##Overall, I've found this to be a great phone and I'm thus far very happy with my purchase
service[@]##As a side-note, T-Mobile has been very good to me and I've always gotten great customer service from them
##Maybe I'm just lucky in that sense, but they've always worked with me when I had a question or had to extend a payment
camera[@]##So unless you're looking for a camera phone or something with a high "everything" factor (ie, the Sidekick), this is a great, solid phone with just the right amount of bells and whistles for normal, everyday users
[t] A Great Phone
##I was looking for my first cell phone, and I wanted something that wasn't too expensive, but worked
##The Motorola V180 is great
##However, if you are looking for the latest and best features, DO NOT buy this phone
##Pros
[t] The V180 is a winner !
##Competing with Samsung's successful E105 GSM phone, here comes the Motorola V180
##It's a quad-band GSM world phone that should be a nice upgrade for anyone who is still using a V60 series phone
##It is also a refreshing step-down from the battery-guzzling smart phones out there
##I had a Blackberry 6850, and despite the rich features, it didn't have what I wanted most - a loud ring
##When Motorola rolled-out this basic flip phone, I immediately went for it, and I like it!Battery life is impressive, with a standby time of over 4 days
##The ringer is loud, and includes the "continental" ring heard on Motorola candybar and iden (Nextel) phones of the late 1990's
##I found that refreshing
##a ring that sounds like a classic corporate ring
##The buttons are not as cheesy as many of the reviewers have said
##I would say the buttons are the same quality in the V400 series
##There is no camera, but that's a plus in my opinion
service[@][u]##And you can still get your weather and sports scores thanks to Cingular's MEdia 
##It also has USB connectivity, so you can manage the address book and calendar using your PC
screen[@]##The screen is tiny by today's standards, at 180x180 pixels, but the layout is bright and clean
design[@],battery[@]##My advice - if you need a ultralight flip phone with long battery life, downloadable extras, and a solid design that would go with your suit, take a good look at the Motorola V180 and the Samsung E105
##You don't need bells and whistles
##You just need a very good phone
##This is it
[t] A good basic phone
##I got my V180 via a free upgrade through Cingular
##This is my 3rd cell phone, first "flip up" model
##Prior phones were from Nokia and Siemens
##I've had it for 3 months now
##I'm not into cameras, games, dowloading ringtones, etc
##etc
##I just want a cheap and reliable phone
##Pros -- Great reception (Milwaukee, WI)- Speakerphone works well
battery[@]##- Average battery life
##I have to charge every 4-5 days
##- Buttons are on the small side, but they work well
##If you have long fingernails, maybe this isn't the phone for you
##- It was FREE FREE FREE
##Cons -- If the phone is in my pants pocket it's difficult to hear the ring
##- Vibrations are on the weak side
##If it's set to vibrate and you have it in your pants pocket, you may not be able to feel it
##- Address book sorts via first name, not last
##Also, it allows only one phone number per name, so if someone has three phone numbers (home, work, and cell) you have to make three entries
##There's a little symbol that tells if it's a home, work or mobile number
##- Have to crack it open to adjust ring volume
##- Manual is sketchy on the details sometimes
##Overall a good free phone
##This is my first Motorola product and I am pleased
##Update
[t] Skip this one
##My wife and I purchased a pair of these phones about 3 months ago
##At first we thought they were great, then calls started dropping left and right
##We had switched from TDMA to GSM, and I figured it might be caused from a bad signal in our area
##then I noticed that as soon as the calls dropped, the signal went to full
software[@][u]##I called AT&T; to report the problem, they told me that they were aware of a  problem that would drop calls when the phone switched towers
##Their resolution
##reboot my phone before you place a call
##I tried to humor them for awhile since they claimed the problem was being worked on
##1 month later I still have the problem
software[@]##I call up to AT&T; "customer service" and was told that there was a known issue with the software in the phone and that they would replace the phone for $15 each
service[@]##Not willing to pay $30 to have our phones replaced I requested a service credit to cover the $30 expense (since the problem was their's, not mine) They refused, telling me "There was no physical way they could bill back the $30, becuase it was a manufacturer fee" I would ditch their service, except that I just re-upped for 2 years when I purchased this phone, and would have to pay $175 per line for early termination, and since I got a rebate from the retailer, I would also face a $150 per line fee if I cancelled the service within 180 days
##What a joke!My overall suggestion
[t] Boooooo V180
##This phone was fairly reliable for about 6 months and then everything started going wrong
screen[@]##The the cover LCD screen went out and then the main screen went about a month later
##I did a little surgery on it to discover the wires running from the main body of the cellphone to the flip cover were frayed from just normal usage
design[@]##I blame this to faulty design on motorola's part
[t] Very unhappy with V180
##I was excited awhile back when my 2 year contract with Cingular ended even though my V60g still works very well
##I have been happy with three V60s I got for my family 2
##5 years ago
##And my wife has a Moto V300, which is a good phone
battery[@]##I figured I would research the new Moto phones and get something with better reception, more features, and possibly better battery life
##Unfortunately, I am very displeased in the V180
##Here's why
[t] Motorola V8100
##I purchased this phone in June
##About a month after using it it started acting "funny"
battery[@]##It kept ramdomly shutting off and the battery would not stay charged for more than 2 hours
##I returned the phone to Cingular and they game me a new one
##The "new" phone stays charged longer and doesn't shut off randomly BUT it will say that is has full signal, then you go to make a call and as soon as it connects the signal drops to nothing
##It will say you have full signal while you are talking on it but the person on the other end can't hear you speak
##Also, it will have signal in places that no cell phone would and have no signal in places that every cell phone would
[t] This phone is not too great......
##I do not really like this phone at all
##I bought it off Ebay, which was a mistake to start off with
##The seller had said it was barely used but I doubt it
##At first the phone seemed nice but then i started to have the same problems other people have
screen[@]##My LCD screen cracked and there is now a big blob on it
##Also sometimes when I call people I can hear them talk, but they can't hear me
##It is rather strange
screen[@]##Yesterday I pulled out my phone and realized that the screen wont even come back anymore
screen[@]##I can still dial but I cannot even see the screen to see if I messed up dialing a number
##I reccomend that if you are going to get a cell phone you should try another one first
[t] Reception isn't that good
##I swithced from T-mobile Nokia 3560 to Cingular moto V 180
battery[@]##The phone is good with sufficient features - good display, speaker, ringtones, USB, keys, appearance, battery life etc
##But I clearly noticed a not so good reception quality
##Before Moto v 180 I had nokia 6010 (for 2 weeks, with cingular) and that phone showed full signal in many places around my school like open places, roads, building tops etc
##But moto v 180 never showed full signal even in places where Nokia 6010 showed full signal
service[@]##So, its not the service problem
##Except this I did not see any other problem
##Probably my piece is a defective one
[t] Great Basic Phone
##If you're not a techy person, don't talk a lot and looking for a simple phone, this is a good one
##I've had this phone for over a year with T-mobile
screen[@]##I never had any problems with my lcd screen that the other reviewers have experienced
##Pros1
screen[@]##You can customize the menu screen
##2
battery[@]##Long battery life3
##Easy to dial keypad4
##Sturdy
##I dropped this phone many times and not once did it ever come apart
##5
##It has volume controls on the side of the phone
##6
##Great speakerphone
##7
ringtones[@]##Many ringtones provided
##You can also download at least 8 more if you don't like to use the Motorola ones
##Cons1
##The highest volume isn't that loud
##2
screen[@]##There is no date display on the screen
##3
ringtones[@]##Customized ringtones for callers can only be saved to phone only, not on the SIM card
##4
screen[@]##LCD screen is small
##I've had calls dropped and sometimes call quality isn't good
##But that is just like any other phone
##Overall, it's pretty good
camera[@][u]##I'm upgrading my phone to the Samsung T-619 because I am finally in the thin  phone craze
[t] Tin cans work better
##This phone is horrible because
[t] Great Starter Phone
##I purchased this phone as a starter phone for my Fiance'
##He needed to get used to the new functions that GSM has to offer
##It is a simple phone to use and won't accidently dial someone becuse of the flip function
##If you are looking for a starter flip phone this is the one for you
[t] Phone does what it's suppose to and Cingular is great.
##I received this phone about 2 months ago and it's a really good phone
##Although it doesn't have ten million cool features, it performs its duties as a phone very well
ringtones[@]##I use the alarm a lot, it seems to do a better job than my actual alarm clock and the standard ringtones are actually pretty good
##One gripe-The phonebook is setup weird, you can't put two numbers with one contact except by selecting "only show main"
[t] great phone
##I got this phone last year for my birthday and im really happy with it
##It isnt really hi-tech like some other phone out there but its really simple and easy to use for someone who just wants to use it for the reason phones are made
[t] I'm happy with mine
##This is my first GSM phone
##I've had two TDMA phones from Cingular before this (my wife still uses one)
##I was replacing a Nokia 8260
screen[@],size[@]##I like the size and weight of this phone, and the screen is bright
##The controls are easy to use and the interface is pretty adaptable
##I like that I can use regular MP3s for ring tones instead of those terrible monophonic tones that earlier phones had
##They sounded like MIDI to me
##I also like that this phone has AIM on it
##All my friends use AIM, so now I can get IMs when I am at the office, instead of only in the evenings when I am at home
##I also like that it has a USB port that will sync contacts with my OSX AddressBook
##Bluetooth would have been nicer, but I bought a cable for $15 at Best Buy and it works perfectly
##If I had a complaint, it would be the web browser
##It's not really usable on any web sites that were not designed for cell phones
[t] If I disuade at least one consumer from buying this piece of
##junk, I will be happy
##Honestly, this is the worst tool I've ever come across
##The casing is cheap plastic which lets in dust obscuring the exterior number/time display (and that display is just about the only useful thing on this phone
##) You will be swabbing out the display almost daily
##It stores only the last ten numbers you receive or dial; and will also list calls you miss as "received"accessing your address book requires pressing a sequence of numbers/keys whereas the last two phones i've had only required one
##The microphone/earpiece frequently experience feedback and echo
##I received this phone on feb
##14 and didn't even make it to april 15 before I started experiencing problems
##I also hear that the display frequently goes out
##I have not experienced that personally, but I don't doubt it
battery[@]##the battery length is hit and miss
##sometimes i am able to go days without recharging
##sometimes it's every other day
##and i have extremely routine phone usage
##Please
##please save yourself the aggrivation and do not buy this phone
##I might also caution you away from Cingular services
##I loved AT&T
##; Now that they merged with cinular, it's been nothing but a nightmare
service[@]##I never wanted cingular service and I still do not want cingular service
##stick with phones by samsung or (my preference) nokia
[t] Very Bad Workmanship
##The quality of this phone is a joke
##The first problem was the hinge of the flip up part
##It started having problems almost immediately with with the hinge sticking and cracking from regular use
##In less than a year in had shorted out completely
##The only good things about it a couple of loud ringers
##DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
[t] Not Too Shabby
##The phone is great for those people who don't need or won't use a lot of the features that are coming standard in phones today
##I have gone through one of these phones already and am using my second
##The first phone worked fine for about 6 months, then the vibrate function quit working
screen[@]##The screen would also randomly go black and the phone would shut off
##I had the phone replaced under warranty
##So far, I have had none of those problems recur
battery[@]##I'm having some small issues with the battery life, but, it is the original battery and its almost 2 years old
##I also use my phone a lot
##Also, I have noticed that the loudness of the ringer is starting to get a little weak
##Good thing I'm getting a phone upgrade
##The phone is lightweight
##It was actually a little too lightweight for me so I purchased the leather case for it
##Not only did it make it easier for me to hold but kept it out of my pocket where it could easily get crunched and helped keep the phone in an overall better condition
##I have not had any issues with signal quality and I think the speakerphone could be a little clearer
##I give it 3 stars because it isn't a bad phone at all for someone who just needs something basic and won't be using it all the time
##For those who want more features, obviously, this isn't for you
##I'm kinda on the fence concerning the phone issues that I have had
##Vibrate function shouldn't have gone out that quickly, however, the matter was handled promptly and no other major issues have arisen
[t] Reliable, hardy phone
##This may not be the sexiest phone as in one with all the latest features, but it has the features that are most needed
##The menu system is easy to learn
internet[@],button[@]##My only complaint is tht if you accidently hit the internet button you're charged for bytes that you don't need
screen[@]##There should be a screen asking if you want to continue
##Although lightweight it isn't as thin as the latest, but it is still small
##I dropped it a few times and it withstood the impact
price[@]##The price is right as I can't see spending over a hundred or so for a phone
[t] Very impressed
##I have had this phone for about 8 months and it has performed light years better than the Siemens candy bar phone we had before
##Very few dropped calls, not crystal clear but very good, and easy to use
##Over all I was very satisfied with this phone up until 4 weeks ago when we took a trip to Texas to see my Aunt
##Now I am Very Impressed and STUNNED
##My Aunt gathered up a bunch of my kids clothed and towels to wash them not knowing the cell phone was amongst the dirty clothes
##This phone made it though the entire wash cylcle and was found just before entering the dryer
##When I tried to turn it on there was no response so I hoped a day or two of drying time might breath life back into my phone but still nothing
battery[@]##In a last ditch effort I polished the contacts of the battery which had some soap scum on them and believe it
##the phone has been working with no ill affects ever since
##I don't advocate trying this at home but still working after being submerged in a washer is VERY IMPRESSIVE to me
[t] Give it some credit!
##I owned this phone for about a year before upgrading to a new phone
##Looking back on our life together (haha), I've got good things to say about this phone
##Pros
[t] Nothing but aggravation.
##About a year ago my old cell phone finally gave out on me after 3 or 4 years of extreme usage, and cingular had me "upgrade" to the v-180
##Well, I've had nothing but problems since
screen[@]##Within of month of having the phone I had to send it back under warranty because the screen stopped working
service[@][u]##They sent me a new one and all was well for 3 or 4 months, after which time people stopped being able to hear me, even when i had full 
##Apparently the wires that are attached to the microphone broke
##So again, I sent the phone back to cingular and again, they sent me another new one
##That was in september and about a month ago I had the same problem, except this time Cingular refused to send me a new phone saying that i was out of warranty
##So now I have to spend money to replace their faulty equipment
##The phone does have its good points though
design[@],size[@][u]##The layout is intuitive and easy to get used to, the  and design fits perfectly, and it has all the extras that I personally need
##However none of this matters if you can't actually USE the phone
##I highly suggest staying away
[t] Good Little Phone
##I purchased two (2) of these phones one for me and one for my wife
##We have had no problems with these phones
##They are easy to use and have few draw backs
##The only downside I can see is the phones seem kind of flimsy
##I haven't dropped it hard or beat it around too much but I don't see them taking much abuse and still working
##Other than that I am satisfied with them
[t] Good Phone & Great Customer Service
##Migrated from former AT&T wireless to cingular
battery[@]##The best thing I like about this phone is its long lasting battery life, seems to run forever compared to my previous phones
##I even dropped it to the floor while I stepped off my car; it didn't break except for a few scracthes (don't try this
[t] Solid Phone in a cheap body
##I got this phone as a stand by, because they did not have the S710a in stock
##The first thing that I noticed about this phone is its the cheapest plastic used, even my water bottles look more solid
##The screen's not too great but its decent
##The speakerphone is very functional
##I can hear clearly, but the guy on the other end says that its like I'm in a well
##Reception and voice clarity is very good
##the phone feels good in the hand, the antenna pokes you in the thigh when you put it in your pocket
##Overall a good decent phone which is for users who do not need any fancy stuff on the phone
##PS DO NOT BROWSE THE INTERNET IF YOU DONT HAVE THE PROPER PLAN
##Cingular will make sure you are raped there
battery[@]##****updateThis phone sucks, it absolutely sucks, the battery life is HORRIBLE, 40 mins talk time, 1 day standby, no games played, no media played nothing, and guess what? it gets even better!!! it just died!! just DIED!!! i cant switch it on, i cant do anything!
##i tried removing the battery, sim, everything! now all i can do is charge the phone! how useful! shame on you Motorola (and yeah its scratched like from a cats paws!) all this in 2 days
[t] These phones don't last
##My family bought three of these phones with a Cingular plan
##None of the three phones lasted a year
##Two of the three chargers also died
##We've had other cell phones such as Nokia and Sony that were much more reliable
##Motorola phones are junk
[t] Great mp3 player - terrible phone
##If you are looking for an mp3 player and don't plan on talking on your phone much, then you may want to check out the SLVR
##For the rest of you who like to use your phone TO TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE, I recommend buying a different phone
##I am constantly having to say "what?" "huh?" "can you repeat that?" because of the totally digitized and fuzzy voice quality of this phone
##If that's not enough, the functionality is unintuitive
##You have to press 5 buttons to dial the previously missed call
##8 buttons to get to voicemail
##What?Then of course, other functions are TOO easy to get to
##Like firing up the web browser
button[@]##Yeah, that's one touch and it's easy to accidentally press that button
##Of course if you do, you get charged like 20 cents a second - a costly mistake that adds up
##But if that's not enough, you can't add information to an address entry without starting over and creating a new contact
##It's insane
##But if you want to add another phone number, unique ring tone, etc
##well, you can't because you there is no "save" option for the SIM card when you're editing
##I bet several of my friends they couldn't save a ringtone to their name
##No one could (and these are people who are tech-savvy and all work in the tech industry)
##This is ridiculous
##If I were the president of Motorola, I'd promptly fire the people who were in charge of this last piece of functionality
##Embarrassing
##Addendum on Jan 14, 2006
[t] Phancy Phenomenal Phabulous Petite Pink Phone
##First of all, pink just makes a Mamalinde happy
##After spending WAY too much time on the phone with Cingular in a long and drawn out "upgrade" request and after being promised the phone twice and having it not shipped as promised, I had about reached the point of switching carriers and stopping the torture
##But, I finally got my phancy pink phone and it was worth the wait
##Where to start? How about with one thing at a time, which is how I managed the learning curve on this pheature laden phoneAddress Book
[t] Great phone
##The texturized buttons don't bother me; in fact, they seem to keep my fingers from slipping when I dial
##The color is great (getting lots of compliments)
##Lots of storage for numbers
camera[@]##The camera feature takes clear pics for a cell phone
##It has an alarm clock in the tools section, which I like to use when I am away from home
battery[@][u]##The  standby time is really long
##Several days go by before I need to recharge
##This is my first phone with bluetooth; it's easy to use, but it takes some getting used to
##The phone has speaker too
sound[@]##I am getting great reception and others tell me that I sound more clear than my old phone
##The phone is easy to navigate; you can even program the buttons to have the function you want if the preprogrammed ones don't feel natural to you
##The music capability is convenient, the phone came with the appropriate cable to hook up to the computer to download the songs
screen[@]##The screen does get smudgy, but it is very colorful and clear
[t] Great phone
##I bought an unlocked SLVR L7 Pink phone and it is really great
##My son liked it so much he bought a black SLVR L7
service[@]##I really don't have any complaints other than my Phone service doesn't support the phone at this time and I can't get any downloads, but that doesn't have anything to do with the phone itself
[t] Oh how I wish I could give this 5 stars!
##First off this is my first review for an item off of Amazon because I felt like the truth needed to be told
##I really really really want to give this phone 5 stars, but I can't
##I give it a 3 and that is mostly for its looks
##Pros
[t] practically no hassle, and ended up saving a lot of $$$, esp. with rebate
service[@]##I just wanted to let people know that they don't have to worry about porting their number when purchasing new service with Cingular through Amazon
##I was a little concerned about how smoothly this would go, given the mixed reviews, but it only took a couple hours
##However, I am only giving 4 stars because the pink phone is a bit brighter than is depicted in the picture
##Also, does anyone know how I can set my phone so that it does not roll over to voicemail so quickly when someone calls? I have not been able to find any settings for this, either on the phone, or through the voicemail feature
##All in all though, I am enjoying my new phone!
[t] Few complaints
##I bought this phone in Nov/Dec
##2006 and have enjoyed it quite a bit
##Granted, I don't use the iTunes and special features all that much, but for what I use, it's good
##It fits easily into a jacket pocket or the pocket of a purse, which is nice
##However, I do have to set it to vibrate *and* ring when it's tucked away or else I won't hear it in the store or another location with background noise
##If it's out on a countertop or in my hand, it's plenty loud
##The buttons/keys are rather tiny and I have to use my fingernail to press them usually
##A little aggrivating sometimes, but I have had no problems with the phone itself
service[@]##Most people who complain about reception are probably dealing with a faulty phone or are not giving proper (dis-)credit to their service provider
##I've never had reception problems with this phone
screen[@][u]##I also found a good scratch-resistant  protector on amazon (by Eforcity) for under $2 that fits this  perfectly
##You can't even see it
[t] Great phone and CUTE!!
##I was strongly cautioned not the buy either a RAZR or SLVR, so I did research to find a phone that would best suit my needs AND be something cute and attractive (if I am keeping it for two years, this is a must!)
##I fell in love with the look of the SLVR but I still felt like I needed to look into it and compare with other phones
##I read all of the reviews, good, bad and ugly and decided, for my needs, this was the phone for me
##So far, this has been a great choice! The phone itself is very attractive and I was able to find a case specifically made for the L7's that enhanced this even more, instead of hiding it behind some bulky material
##I have no problems with the reception and can always hear clearly and be heard clearly
ringtones[@]##The biggest disappointment I had was that I couldn't figure out how to assign individual ringtones and assumed this this was not an option of the phone rather than being the outcome of the ill-informed user that I was
##Reading other reviews showed that this was a disappointment for other users as well
##WE WERE WRONG! My best advice
[t] I love this phone!!!
##I love the SLVR phone
##I have not had any major problems with it at all
##The only complaint is that I cannot assign specific speed dial numbers to certain numbers
##The itunes function will only allow 100 songs on your phone, no matter how big your card is
##However, I love the itunes function on the phone because I can just play it whenever I like (it is great to use when waiting for the bus)
##You need to use a San Disk micro sd card with the phone though, I tried to use a kingston micro sd card and the phone would not recognize it
##The buttons, menus, and programs are easy to use with the phone
##I would recommend that if the phone is in your purse or pocket, you lock the keyboard often because the number pad is very sensitive to touch
##The phone is durable, I have dropped it several times and it still kept on working
internet[@][u]##If you are looking for a slim phone to play music text, and surf the  once in a while, it is a great choice among phones
[t] Pretty Pink Practical Phone
##I recently ordered this phone through amazon and I must say I love it!! It is everything I wanted in a phone and more
##To me its the best of both worlds, the pretty pink exterior is just my style, the itunes is so easy to use, and it is very practical to use as an everyday phone
##I just love it!!
[t] Horrible Buttons
##This phone does everything it says it does just fine, but I cannot stand it for one reason--THE BUTTONS
##THEY DRIVE ME POSITIVELY INSANE
##The "brushed steel" thing is horrible, it feels like pushing on sandpaper
##The buttons are not raised at all, in fact they are RECESSED into the phone! Everything about them is horrible
##I hate pushing buttons, and that is the main function of the phone! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OFF THE INTERNET!! Go into a store and look at it and push the buttons before you buy it!!!!!!! If you don't, you will probably reallllly regret it
##Trust me on this, I would've loved the phone but for the buttons
[t] ZERO battery life!
price[@]##I bought a RAZR for my wife a year ago, when Cingular had a monopoly on them and the price was 4x what it is now (silly me!)
##It's very stylish and syncs via Bluetooth with the car nicely
battery[@]##But the battery life on this phone SUCKS! I've read several reviews noting that it needs to be charged every day -- which, IMO, is ridiculous for any cell phone these days; but I've found that this POS needs to be charged sometimes 2x or more per day, without what I would consider to be extraordinary use
##I worked for Motorola for years and know they are capable of making a much better product
##My gut tells me that they once again put form before function on this phone
##Real disappointing
[t] This phone is great!!!
design[@],camera[@]##It is light weight, slim, and the lcd comes in so clear! The camera is not bad also! The new design makes it very easy to use, and very fun
##If you are new to using cell phones or not a tech guru this phone is for you!
[t] Great Phone
##I have had this phone for about 1 month and love it to death
##I just love to open it and close for effect
##It really is a conversation piece, people constantly want to touch and play with your phone
##I suggest either buying or downloading Moto Phone Tools 3
##0
##You can buy it on ebay for like $5
software[@][u],ringtones[@]##It is a great  item you can get your own ringtones and upload pictures
[t] This is a very compact phone with great features
##The Motorola Razr V3 is a very nice phone, it's light in weight, but heavy in talk time
##Motorola states "the talk time on the Razr V3 is 9
##5 hours" this talk time versus the talk time on the Razr's sister phone the Motorola V330 is about a 4 hour difference
camera[@]##Although these phones have just about the same feature the Razr has a megapixel camera where the V330 only has standard VGA an d the weight of the Razr is 3
##42 oz while the V330 weights in at 4
##62 oz (phonescoop
##com)
##So with the light weight, longer talktime, and sleekness I think that the Razr is a better choice
[t] Great phone, not perfect!
##This is an awsome phone, I give it 5 stars because it deserves them
##It looks very cool, everybody will notice it and compliment you on it
battery[@]##The bluetooth works great BUT it will drain your battery in a days use
##I hava an Acura TL with bluetooth capabilties so a Bluetooth
##This brings me to the fact that most bluetooth phones are big and ugly
service[@][u]##This phone gets better reception on my ATT  (now cingular) than what my ericcson t616 did
##I recomend this phone highly, and now its very cheap, so just get it
battery[@]##Its still a great phone, my only complaint would be battery life when bluetooth is turned on
##Other than that 5 stars
[t] 1 word, 1 star##One of my friends owns this phone and I tried using it
design[@]##I think it's an overall horrid design
##The phone itself only has a few settings and is the most ugliest thing I've ever seen
##It's hard to navigate and even worse to use
##Just because it's `thin' is no reason to get it, because instead of being `chunky' like other phones it's a lot wider to make up for the `thinness'
##Don't go near this phone
##You'll thank me for it in the end
[t] Good Phone, but service provider (Cingular) may need improvement
##I had the phone since March 2005
##Never had any problems except Cingular may drop the call occassionally
##I dropped the phone twice on the street already (still working by far and not even a crack on the phone, luck me)
##The only wishful improvement on the phone is bluetooth
##If I am in the middle conversation and call is dropped
##The bluetooth headset will not respond until I reconnect the headset to the phone (or, it could be headset problem - Model is HS850)
##Other than that, I am happy with the phone
[t] razr v3
##so far so good
##i'm very happy with the phone thus far
##It's so light i can put it in my pocket and you can barely tell its there
camera[@]##the camera is ok
##if the person is not standing still the pic is fuzzy
##I'm waiting for my wireless head set to come in, that should be very cool
##ya, i'd have to say this is a great phone
##i'm the envy of the office
[t] can't hear!!!
##Yes, the phone looks cool, but not worth the inability to hear the person on the other line
##I bought the $20 earpiece and actually can hear better with that, though it is a little too big for my ear
##I've had the phone for 2 months and it does seem a little slow, like it had a stroke
##I don't know if it's the phone or the service, but my signal does get choppy and cut out at least once during a conversation
##And it fails some of the calls I dial often
##Overall, if you don't have to pay for the phone, it's not a bad deal, but I wouldn't spend a dime on it
[t] Looks great but not worth it.
##I am mostly utilitarian
##I have been using cellular phones since the mid 90's
##My favorite phone of all time was the Nokia, it was big and bulky, but it worked and was durable
size[@][u]##I then switched to Samsung for its 
##It took a little getting used to but ultimately I ended up loving the phone for its simplicity and good function
##I decided to treat myself with something a little more stylish and got the Razr
##The styling is very impressive, but once you have it a few weeks - who cares
##The phone functions poorly
##I am on my third Razr in only a month, that should tell you something
sound[@]##I have this high pitched sound coming from the ear speaker on incoming calls that has been consistent with every phone I've received, just this alone makes me want to smash the phone with a hammer
##I am new to Bluetooth and am looking forward to a new ear piece
##I think this phone was a marketing experiment
[t] Best Phone Ever!!
##Pros
[t] Great phone but incredibly poor customer (no)service
##If you want bling then this is your phone, it looks great; if you're looking for functionality consider the Audiovox SMT5600
##Regardless of the phone you chose, however, I hope you have more luck with Cingular than I did
##There's simply not enough time or room to recount all of my problems with Cingular but I'll provide a brief recap
service[@]##I have service with Cingular and with AT&T
service[@]##; The problems began when I tried to merge my two services into one account (Cingular did acquire AT&T;, right?), upgrade my service plan, and upgrade the AT&T; phone
##Simple enough, right? Wrong
##After (literally) four visits to the store (and 3+ hours of waiting for a sales person), 10+ phone calls (and speaking with over 30+ people), and completing several forms on the web I thought I had finally solved the problem and everything was fine
##THEN my phone showed up
service[@]##it was the wrong one!!! Attempts to get the problem resolved on the phone failed (we can't do that here), attempts to return it to the store failed (that was sent to you by our phone sales group, you can't return it here), and a final desperate attempt to resolve it through Cingular's Office of the CEO was meet by "you shouldn't have tried to transfer your service from AT&T; to Cingular" (i
##e
##it's your fault) and "you're trying to order the most expensive phone we have, what do you expect us to do, give you a free one?" (i
##e
##you're trying to cheat us)
##My experiences can basically be catagorized in the following fashion
[t] phone book solved
##seems everyone is trying to get mutiple phone numbers for single person
##all u need to do is trun on the view primary contacts in the phone book menu
##store the different numbers in to same name under one person
##then mutiple phone numbers for same name will only show up once
##if you want another phone number of that person, you can scroll to that name using up and down key then use the left and right key to show different icon for that person/name
##also in the phone book you can click on view then using up and down to view other numbers for that person, in that mode, it will list all the numbers
price[@][u]##about the phone, i think the craftsmanship could be better or more consistent for this 
##the phone wouldn't close flush
##and the bettery back wouldn't close flush on one of my phone
screen[@]##the buttons inprint onto the screen
##it dont use the normal headphone jack anymore, it's using the mini USB (the only connection port) for both headphones and charge
software[@]##also if you want to sync with your outlook, you need to buy the mobile phone tools software and the USB to mini USB cable, both 2
##11 and 3
##11 versions of MPT will sync outlook addresses but only 3
##11 will let you have a v3 look for the program and can add/edit media files to the phone
##you can find more info on those on net by searching "mobile phone tools 3
##11"
##I transfered my phone book over from my sony t616 to outlook then to v3 with no problem
##if you use my method on the top you will have similar phone book funtions on the v3 as of t616
##dont border put v3 onto bluetooth sync, cause the phone dont have the bluetooth sync profile, so you cant sync with your own bluetooth device, may be only the ones from motorola
screen[@]##amond all, the voice, the speaker-phone, the receptions, the screen and non-motorola bluetooth headphones works great on this phone
[t] noise and vibrations
##Got my v3 yesterday
##Has anyone else noticed the really bad noise interference - high pitched and continuous, or the annoying vibration under your thumb from the keyboard as you text etc???Also this phone is extremely simplistic compared to my sony ericcson
##Am afraid I will be sending mine back
[t] Still waiting for my $150 refund - five months and counting
##The phone is o
##k
##One piece of the adaptor to charge the phone was not working on delivery
##Cingular would not exchange the part and blamed Amazon and said good luck getting the part from them
##Five months have gone by and I am still waiting for my rebate
[t] Looks great, software is awful.
##The is a great looking phone, and it feels awesome in your hand
software[@][u]##unfortunately the  is terrible!!! Taking pictures is extremely slow, and the pictures are pretty bad
##Video is incredibly slow, and again slow to store
screen[@][u],size[@]##Viewing pictures is terrible because you can only fit to  and zoom to actual size
##(which is useless) and nothing in between
##Sending picture messages is just ok
##not too bad I guess
##No IR means you can't send to your computer unless you have bluetooth
##To top it all off, I just took possibly the best picture ever taken of my 5yr daughter jump roping
##The timing was perfect and it looked like a photo from time life magazine
##I saved it to my phone, and later when I looked at it, the thumbnail image showed the photo but when I selected it, it was a completely different photo!!! I tried a dozen times to view the photo and as far as I can tell it is not saved
##only the thumbnail exists which is somehow linking to a different photo
##I can't even begin to describe how furious I am with this piece of junk right now
software[@]##I am a software developer myself, and I can't fathom how the clowns who wrote this software are still employed
##A beautiful phone but the crappy applications make it nothing special
software[@]##The software on my nokia 6620 is excellent, but unfortunate that phone is mechanically junk
[t] Good Phone!
camera[@]##great quality, good reseption and camera quality
##love it
##getting my brother one for x-mas
battery[@][u]##the  is fast dieing (but is is a used phone)
##BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!!
[t] Razr Lady
##I just purchased the Razr and have to admit when I first saw the commercial I wanted the phone, even before I knew what features it had
##Plus I wanted something no one else had
##Now that I have it I LOVE IT
##I love that it is small and compact
sound[@]##It has great camera, the reception is awesome (although it can sound like there is an echo-doesn't bother me though), overall it's great
##Minor gliches, multiple entries for one person (does anybody have suggestions for this?) and smudge marks (constanly wiping phone
[t] Good phone, bad camera
##I've had my Razor for about 4 months
battery[@]##It's battery life is good, about 3 days with light useage
##I have downloaded a program which allows charging via my laptop's USB port
##The same USB to firewire connector can be used to charge my blackberry
##This means two less chargers/adaptors to carry
##The audio quality is fine, and reception is usually good
camera[@]##I thought that the camera might be useful when we needed a quick picture of something important like a real estate sign or police beating an innocent suspect
##Fortunately, we found out that the zoom is useless on a real estate sign
##It isn't what you might think of as an optical zoom
##The digital zoom doesn't actually make things seem closer and clearer
##It merely lowers the resolution
##On 4x zoom, instead of a 640x480 resolution picture, you get a 160x120 picture
##Thus, the zoom is useless
##Hopefully, you can safely walk closer to whatever you want a good picture of
##It's the ultimate in manual zoom
[t] Great Phone, rebate sucks!
##First of All, the Razr has been a delight to own
##My only complaints are the available receiver volume (too low) and its tendency to turn off if you bang it a little hard
battery[@]##(The battery can be reseated and everything's grand
##However, after 8 months, I finally heard back from my rebate
##For reasons not explained, I was ineligible for any rebate
##Just be careful!
[t] Top of the pop
##I like this phone
##Quad band allows me to leverage the best of GSM in Bay Area with Cingular
design[@][u]##The  is just so sleek
##I have no complaints
[t] Software is buggy. Garbage. Flimsy.
software[@]##I've had to buy this phone three times and all three times the software crashed
##it's buggy as hell
##it also bends easy, so forget about putting it in your pocket
##The things are crashing all over the country
##It's 500 garbage
##Perhaps in six months time, they'll have it all worked out, but for now, you be better off with two Dixie cups and some string
[t] Love my new phone
##Got the razor and I gotta say it's great
sound[@]##I'd heard that the sound quality was bad, but I find that it's fine
size[@][u]##But the best feature is its 
##You'll love how thin it is
[t] Motorola V3 RAZR
##This phone is somewhat similar to the V300 I had as far as menu, navigation and such
##Just to clear up some confusion
##Volume, it's loud although not as loud as some of those speakers you hear in clubs and such
##duhhhh
battery[@]##who the hell said it wasn't loud should either A) Get a hearing aid or B) change out the your hearing aid battery if you already have one (or get a new one cuz obviously your deafness has increased in severity)
##This phone is locked
##Someone said Cingular doesn't lock their phones
##well either they have started locking or they were talking out of the a$$
##Reception of this V3 is wayyy better than V300 (or was it because Cingular has better reception than Tmobile in my area)
##Anyhow, I like this phone
##I only give it 4 stars because there are minor things can be improved (i'm picky)
##Also, I got this thing for around $100 after rebates so it's not bad
##just have to wait months and months for the rebates to come
[t] Don't buy this phone with Cingular
##I have really bad reception with this phone
##It disconnected by itself all the time
##Usually I get less than 2 bars for signal
##I returned it and got new one
##But new one is worse!!Amazon sent me refurnished one
##If someone want to buy from different store with different service,I recommand it
##The phone looks so nice and has fun features
[t] Poor Quality
##I recently puchased a Motorola V3 RAZR (on march 30 to be exact) today is April 7th and I am going tomorow to change the RAZR for another phone!
##Before you consider buying this phone be REALLY SURE!!! I am going to explain why
##Ok, Im only 17 so I had to BEG my mother for like two months to buy this phone since its very expensive but since the phone was "the coolest, and if I didnt have it I would DIE!!" i accept im a bit dramatic but thats is another thing
##Well i finally got it, The FIRST thing they told me is
[t] Keeping Your Numer.
##I have had no problems switching from Sprint to Cingular, I did when I purchased a phone from here, I actually moved from Sprint to T-Mobile then to Cingular and Back to T-Mobile and still had my numeber, amazing huh? I don't think there will be a problem with the rebate
[t] Motorola Razr V3
##This phone stinks
##!! I have owned probably 20 different phones in my time and this one is by far the worst one ever
##It's locked for one thing
##It's so locked I have to mail it in and have a soder done on the motherboard
##(V 8
##26) This phone's keys are not keys at all, but flat and unusable
##Don't buy this phone
##It's also way too fragile
##I had to return it for a new one after only having it for 1 month
##Plus, the menus are incredibly inefficient
##I have one that is for T-Mobile
##It's $250 I will never get back
##DON'T BUY THIS POHNE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[t] Don't buy it, just don't.
##This phone was one big waste of money
##I am a college student so $350 was a big chunk of change for me and it wasn't worth it
##Shortly after I got the phone it started acting crazy and of course, my company didn't have insurance on it
##Now it doesn't work and I'm totally out a phone
##I will never buy from moto again
[t] Great Phone if you don't mind doing a little work
##I actually wanted to give this phone 4
##5 stars but decided to give it one since there are people like me out there who prefer to check the lowest reviews first
##I found out from a friend that there's a ton of things you could do to bring out the phone's full potential
##If you read up on howardforums and motox's websites (just do a search in google), you'll learn all sorts of ways to trick out your phone
##In addition to getting rid of the cingular logo, you could1
##unlock the hidden video capture ability2
##improve menu navigation speed3
##boost signal strength4
battery[@]##and increase battery life
##Not bad at all if you ask me
##There's also the option of using customizable startup and shutdown animations but that proved to be a little more labor intensive
##All in all, this is a nice little phone
battery[@]##I was concerned at first about the construction and sturdiness, but after actually examining it, I have not found any problems with the battery cover in terms of fit or material (it's aluminum and not plastic)
##Although I must admit that I'm not too thrilled with the location of the volume adjustment buttons, but that's by no means a deal killer
ringtones[@][u]##I'm also disappointed in the fact that my custom  will not work with a bluetooth headset, but again that's only a minor annoyance
design[@]##For those who are familiar with motorola phones, their phone book is not the best in design
##If you want to use a custom ringtone, the contact has to be saved in the phone rather than on the sim card
##To get around showing the same phone number twice, simply copy all contacts to the phone, group them under one catagory and set the preferences to show only that catagory
##Of course the phone resets itself once it's powered off, so that's a bit of an inconvenience
[t] Excellent Phone, Average Software
##To be completely honest, you are paying for style with this phone
##Yes it is slim, but honestly, how big of a deal is that? The phone is quite long, pretty wide, and yet beautiful
##It looks otherworldly, actually
##You can get a phone that performs all of the V3's functions for 50-100 bucks less if you wanted
design[@]##This phone, however, has been perfect for me and I am absolutely in love with its metal casing and design
service[@][u]##Cingular's  is great as usual
##I have not dropped a call yet
software[@]##I used to own a Nokia 6800 phone, and to be quite honest, the software on the Nokia made much more sense than Motorola's
##The address book on the V3 does a poor job of supporting multiple phone numbers for a single person
##As previous reviewers stated, you have to add an entry for each number, instead of listing multiple numbers under one name
##It makes for a very messy phone book
##The Nokia has a supremely superior phone book
##That, however, is really my only complaint
##A couple things about this phone you might not expect
[t] awesome phone with no complaints
##I have had the Motorola Razr V3 for 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it
##It has all the features I want and could ask for
##I also purchased a Jabar (bluetooth compaitable) wireless headset
##WIth the headset and the use of voice initiated dialing, I can answer and make calls without ever taking the V3 out of my pocket
##It took about one day and one day only to get use of holding and using such a thin phone
battery[@]##I have had no issues with battery life even when using it for long periods of time
##I would not pass up this phone
[t] An overvalued underperformer.
##Upon researching this phone endlessly I knew that I was taking a risk upon purchasing it
##First (which is really a non sequitur)the packaging and accessories are inferior to what Motorola had issued overseas,and perhaps that is an issue with Cingular and not Motorola
design[@]##The phone's design is smooth and post modern,truly ahead of its' time
sound[@]##The sound quality was excellent,as was the speakerphone
##That is about all of the redeeming qualities that I surveyed on this phone
price[@][u]##Motorola and Cingular should really be ashamed that they issued such a beautiful phone at such a very hefty  tag with inferior options to its' predecessors
design[@],camera[@]##Because of its' design the memory is low, thus the sacrifices are made in the form of a low quality camera w/o video recording options
ringtones[@]##It also includes far less ringtones than most phones,and background photos
##Such important desktop itemslike the calendar is buried and one must negotiate their way into it (which can probably be changed in my defaults now that I think of it)
##While the keypad is indeed striking, it is not very functional being that it is completely flat hence, if you are not paying attention you may hit the wrong numbers,but that is a small complaint
##If one is inclined to purchase this phone simply because of the design,then go for it
##However, if you're trying to get value for your dollar,wait until/if Motorola improves this phone
[t] Best "phone" I've ever used!
##I was looking for a phone to use as a phone and I wanted something that would last
##This thing, albeit expensive, fit the bill perfectly
##Pros- Excellent reception where others failed to even get a signal- Comfortable Flip Design- No annoying antenna- Great speakerphone- Flawless bluetooth- Awesome construction, zero scratches in 4 weeks- Gets looks like you are driving a Ferrari
##Everyone asks, "Is that that new Razor phone?"
[t] Love it - but wish it was better....
##I have had a Razr phone for three years
##During that time I confess I have gently dropped it at least three times and the phone always reboots and gets itself working again
##However, yesterday, weeks after the last "drop", it seemed to be losing its durability
camera[@]##Out of the blue, the camera turned on and randomly started to take photos
button[@],camera[@]##When I turned it out of camera mode, it switched into the voice record memo menu and would not exit until I hit the end button
##From there the keypad would not work
##I went to a friend's house to call Cingular and they said they would send new "software" to the phone
##It worked for the day, but last night, it started working in the same erratic fashion
battery[@]##I rebooted it and charged the battery and hope it works today
##I am going to see if it acts up again, but pulled out my old samsung freebie which I saved in case I need to use a reliable phone
##If you buy one, beware, all the Razr users I have spoken to comment on the difficulty in hearing callers
ringtones[@]##Also, one minor thing - if you choose to assign ringtones to your phonebook callers, you must save to the phone rather than the sim card - which means if the phone breaks, you will lose those numbers
screen[@]##I like the graphics on the screen which are crystal clear, and the weight and dimensions are great
##It now comes in blue and pink if you like colors, but beware, given these options, I would shop around before settling on the Razr again
[t] Great phone, but has some significant software glitches
##Pros
[t] RAZR V3##The V3 has been the mobile phone to own
##Its reputation even here seems to precede its true cabilities
screen[@]##Nice screen
##Great color
##Key pad is stylish but difficult to use when writing text messages and even dialing the right phone number
##Better to have phone numbers in directory (many easy ways to access without dialing the wrong number)
##The photo capabilities are so poor that if you want this feature on your phone, go look elsewhere (Nokia much better)
##Do not drop this phone
##It becomes history faster than any other phone I have owned
##This is also obvious since Cingular does not offer insurance on this phone - and only this phone!! If you want to own the phone to have according to the hype out there then buy it
##If you want a phone to last more than 6 months, look elsewhere
##A true disappointment
##Not worth more $99 based on features, camera, keypad and longevity
[t] Read the fine print!
##Beware! Offer only good if you are starting a brand new account
##You cannot use this for a second or third line phone, or a upgrade, you will get a $250
##00 charge
[t] flimsy, flimsy!
##I had written a good review originally
##Now I am sorry
##I started noticing play on the hinge and now the phone is broken
##this is why you can't get insurance on this phone! it turns out many people know it is very badly constructed
##they will give you the run aroud even on the manufacturer's warranty
##I have had moble phones for almost 15 years
##I was very careful with this one since it was so expensive
##it just broke on its own
##Be very careful about the "discount price" here
price[@][u]##when this phone breaks you have to keep cingular and you have to buy a new phone at FULL (inflated) 
##do yourself a favor before buying
##call a cingular store
##say you are a customer but want to knoe about return policy for a RAZR
##lol
[t] Good looks, low on features.
##** UPDATE
[t] Cutting edge phone!!!!!!!
##I have been a Nextel user for years and their Motorola products including i90, i95, i730 and i830
##The v3 is the best Motorola product ever!!! Blows the i830 out the water and makes it look like yesterdays news
##Superior and striking good looks and is solidly built - no, it does not look cheap as some previous reviewer stated
##I live in GA and Cingular reception is very good
##Paired my v3 with Bluetrek G2 bluetooth headset(received rave reviews and is cheap - pick one up on ebay) and I wonder what took me so long to get on board
##I did fear Cingular's merger with AT&T; since I had AT&T; years ago and their reception was terrible
##I'll never go back to Nextel as they do not appreciate their customers and their Motorola products do not have Bluetooth except Blackberry
##Plus who wants to carry around a brick in their pocket? I'm a woman and typically carry v3 in my purse but sometimes for convenience I just want to put it in my jean pocket
##And I forget it's there
camera[@]##This v3 has superior browser technology, email and text messaging, good camera and great voice record
##Yes, the address book is different but you get used to it
##Anyways, I only put important people that I call frequently in address book so it's not a problem for me
##I primarily make lots of calls and like to check news and send a few text messages
##A+++++++
[t] Razr V3 works great for me.
service[@]##I live in an area where Cingular service is really good; I have experienced virtually no dropped calls
##The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively
##My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement
##It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner
##I was concerned about the thickness and durability
##This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone
##My old accessories don't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do?I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3
##0 by Avanquest for my previous phone
##I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4
##0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone
##With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I don't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip
##I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone's memory and I use it as my wallpaper
##My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola
##On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning
##I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying
##The Razr and my Jabra work well together
##It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes
##So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone
[t] Very expensive mistake.
design[@],price[@][u]##We were so impressed by the RAZR design that our office bought six of them a few months ago (when the  was $400) and switched to Cingular
##We've had trouble with all seven (a couple guys have been through multiple phones)
##The problems range from things not fitting properly (battery cover, key pad) to crazy behavior such as the phone rebooting every time a call is received
service[@]##Cingular couples a bad phone with bad service
##To them, everything is the customer's fault
##When you have a problem with the phone (which you will), Cingular grills you trying to determine if they can blame your phone's problems on you
##Additionally, and I can't speak about anywhere but Utah
##If you live in Utah STAY AWAY FROM CINGULAR
##They say the coverage is good
##It is not even close to tolerable
##Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from the RAZR AND Cingular as you possibly can
[t] Excellent Phone
##I absolutely love this phone! I used to have a Motorola v300 and my new RAZR is 5 times better
##Between the two
[t] Lots of good features - cannot handle moisture
##This was a great phone for me for about 6 months
##It's small, light, can handle being dropped now and then, and has easy keys to see and use
##I took it for a short bike ride (maybe 30 mintutes)
##Since I didn't have pockets, I put it against my skin under elastic
##I perspired lightly, but it was enough to kill the phone
##It partially revived with several keys not working
##hope that helps any potential buyers
##Keep it very dry!
[t] Time to move on to the next "Big" thing
##If you're like me, someone who likes to keep with the times & buy phones that offer the latest features & design, you'd probably want to skip the Razr
##I bought it (the first of 5) in June 2005
price[@][u]##Had it till December when it was stolen & had to buy it at full retail  (I've learned & now have insurance)
##At the time, I had to pay $360 (I live in NY)
sound[@],price[@]##You can see how much the price has dropped in 14 months! I had the 2nd one for about 6 months before it started to develop this persistent, annoying BUZZING sound whenever I was on the phone
##It didn't matter if I made or received the call or where I was
##I should join the circus as a contortionist for all of the new positions I've discovered in order to bend my body simply to hear & be heard on this phone
##Even then, standing on my head would not always lend itself to a clear call for more than a few minutes
##Finally, after many calls to Cingular & without success in it getting fixed, they sent me another phone before my warranty was up
##A refurbished phone
##That was in December 2006
##In 2 months, I've received 3 Razrs, all with varying issues
button[@][u]##The 2nd one was great for a couple of weeks until out of the blue, the 6  went CRAZY
button[@][u]##I couldn't make a call or text without it inputting 6's or the letters on the 6  (m,n,o I think)
internet[@][u],button[@][u]##Then it would connect me to the  without me even pushing that 
##I was getting charged for the bytes when I never even chose to use that feature
##You can't imagine how terribly annoying it is to have to type a text o n e l e t t e r a t a t i m e v e r r r r y s l o w l y so that the 6's & letters wouldn't go insane (& I mean lines & lines & lines of mmmmnnnnoooommmmnnnooo in a single text which would force me to either abort my text or delete all of the characters)
##The next phone I got was fine until I tried to download Myspace Mobile & it downloaded but then told me I was not an authorized user
##I called to complain about that & all they'd offer was another refurbed phone (i
##e
##half broken)
##I declined as the rest of the phone was fine
##Then just last week, in the middle of a call, the back of my phone just fell right off
battery[@]##I lost the call & I couldn't make/receive any calls until I got the battery out (no easy feat w/o a sharp object) & slid the SIM in & out a few times to satisfy the persnickity phone
##I now have to keep a rubber band around the phone just to keep it together (yeah, real classy!)
sound[@]##In addition, it's now making the buzzing sound I had with the 2nd (new) phone
##I don't know if these issues will help anyone, but I'm just letting you know my personal experiences have been very frustrating
##Cingular is now sending me a new phone (not a Razr) for my troubles & because I threatened to cancel
##Hopefully this will hold me over until my contract is up in June
##As far as the phone & its features, there's good & bad
##SCREEN
[t] Your friends will like looking at it!
##I got the Motorola RAZR V3 cingular phone about a month ago with a new plan for about $100, and it is a GIANT step up from the previous LG phone I had for a couple of years
##This phone can do a lot of things, but you'll only find that out if you do some research- for example
[t] Lots of problem
sound[@],price[@][u]##I bought the phone through independent delear so i got it for cheap  but after a week without calls also there was a high pitch sound coming from speaker
##I called cingular and they sent me a silver one instead of black
sound[@]##Even in those phones there was a sound
sound[@][u]##To observe the  just flip open the phone and hold it as if you are talking
##I tried 4 phones and felt noise in all the phones
##The one I bought had noise level quite high and was problem with talking on phone
[t] Hate this phone !
##I bought this phone from cingular when it first came out
##At first I loved it and I wanted to be "cool" like everyone else and have this ultra slim sleek phone
##However, shortly after I purchased it, it became very hot, and started to burn my face when I used it
##I marched right back to the cingular store and asked what the problem was
##They appologized for the phone and gave me a new one, for free
##So, Of course Im going to take it and be happy
##But I think they gave me a refurbished one! I was very upset, and now I am stuck with it until my plan with cingular is up
##Let me tell you why I hate this phone
##For some reason, it is having a problem with the real tones (you know, the music tones that are like mp3's and you can hear voices)
##When people call, every now and then in stead of ringing, I will hear pure static coming from the phones speaker
##Then the phone will spazz out and I will have to wait 5 minutes for the phone to act normal again
battery[@]##The battery is terrible
##I have to charge this phone at night, all night long
##Then in my car, every time I get into my car , the first thing I do is plug my phone in
battery[@]##If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing
battery[@]##The battery life is just plain terrible
##Its very fragile, I had to purchase a case for it, because my phone likes to fly out of my hand ! (haha) Its very small, and when it falls, it tends to get chipped
##Which makes the phone look terrible
##The speaker phone is horrible
##When I am in my car, and I put someone on speaker phone, I find my self holding it up to my ear anyway
##If a cop pulls me over, he is not going to believe it was on speaker because i was glued to my head anyways, so whats the point !?I dont think it has a very good internal antena
sound[@]##I never had problems with my nokia! This phone has a lot of drop calls, and lately I have been hearing this weird ticking sound
##Almost like static, but more annoying!I do not recomend anyone to buy this phone, it is horrible
[t] a small number of significant flaws
##The Razr is as sleek as they come, but it is not without flaws
##I tried to use it for about 2 days before returning it
design[@][u]##The main reason that I returned it was that the wired headset that comes with it was a very peculiar  which would not really fit in my ear and kept falling out
##I would have overlooked that if it had a standard 2
##5mm headset jack, but the mini-USB connector doubles as the headset jack, so none of the standard headsets that you can buy to use with mobile phones and wireless home phones would work
battery[@]##If you plan to use a Blutooth headset this is not a concern, but I was not interested in a Blutooth headset because they are bulky and you have to hassle with the battery
battery[@]##If it uses a rechargable battery and you don't use it regularly, you'll discover when you want to use it that you have forgotten to keep it charged
##Wired headsets are simple and convenient, and the lack of a standard 2
##5mm headset jack is a significant shortcoming of the Razr
##Additionally, I didn't like the fact that when the Razr is closed, there was no way to tell at a glance whether the phone is on
##Both the interior and exterior LCDs are virtually invisible when their backlights are turned off, so it doesn't help that you can configure the LCD to remain on longer than the backlight
##The purpose of the backlight timer is of course so that the light will go off and not run down the battery, so you would expect that the interior backlight would go off automatically when the phone is closed, but it doesn't
##With the Samsung E335 that I use now, the interior backlight goes off when the phone is closed, and the exterior backlight stays on for a few more seconds
##If the backlight timer expires while the phone is open, the light goes to a much dimmer setting, and goes off completely only if the timer interval elapses again before a key is pressed
##More importantly, both the interior and exterior LCDs remain readable in dim indoor light when the backlight goes out, and there is additionally a small blue light that flashes dimly every few seconds so that you can tell whether it is on even in total darkness
##I was also turned off by the fact that you have to purchase a separate kit from Motorola in order to connect the phone to your PC
##But that gripe also applies to Samsung
##After pondering this, I decided that all I really needed to keep in the phone is the list of phone numbers that I call frequently, which are few
##I don't want my phone to double as a PDA, because I want the phone to be small enough to fit easily in a pocket, and I prefer PDA's that have large touch-sensitive screens
##The Razr is quite small in volume due it being so thin
##I was initially attracted by this because it fits so easily into a shirt pocket
##But the drawback is that because of the corners that go with that square shape, and because of the extra length, it doesn't slip into a pants pocket nearly as easily as the more rounded compact phones, whereas those phones will slip into a shirt pocket nearly as easily as the Razr
##Things often fall out of my shirt pocket when I bend over, but things almost never fall out of my pants pocket
##In the summer months, I often wear shirts that don't even have a pocket, and even if I liked wearing those belt holsters, a more rounded, compact shape is better for them as well
##One feature of the Razr that I liked and which I do not have in the Samsung phone, is the ability to configure the top-level menu so that it is displayed as a text list instead of an array of icons
screen[@]##I also liked the fact that with the Razr, you can configure the functions of the four navigation buttons in the home screen, as well as the functions of the two soft keys (it has a dedicated menu button), and that you can configure the home screen so that it shows, using icons only, the functions of the four navigation keys
screen[@]##However, these capabilities did not prove particularly useful to me, and I have no issue with the fact that in the Samsung phone, one of the soft keys is permanently configured in the home screen to accessing the menu
##(The other soft key is configured to lauch the menu for the phone book, and the four navigation keys are configured to access the phone book search function, the camera, the voice memo recorder, and the text message editor
##) The substantial flexibility that you have with the Razr is of uncertain practical value, and what value it may have is nullified by the fact that its menu structure is overly complex and difficult to learn
##I think that the Razr is lovely to look at and even more lovely to hold
##The way that the narrow spaces between the slick keys were filled with a soft rubbery material made centering your finger or thumb on the key almost automatic
##That is a valid practical consideration, and I think that the other manufacturers should, and probably will, adopt that as well
##But nice as the Razr is, from utility considerations, it has significant shortcomings, and doesn't hold its own against any number of other phones that are available
[t] Interesting thoughts,last second!!
##I loved the phone when i saw it,anybody would
##anybody
##thing is i organized my thoughts from what some people said that it's got the low life battery?
##uhmm what did you expect?!!it's like a nail thing and 2 fingers long i mean common
##anyhow i bought the new black edition doesn't change a thing just a few more persuading screensavers and backscreens,also IT'S BLACK
##even more style for a while
##why a while?
##it's just a color
##but it's a good phone and u won't see one with "those"features on it anytime soon
##it's better to have then not have at all
##thanks for all
##love amazon
##com
##no regrets thanks!aloha
[t] When is it going to come from verizon?
service[@]##I was wondering when or if the Razr v3 cell is ever going to come through verizon? I really want it but the only service provider here in Bryson City,NC is Verizon and the Razr is only covered by Cingular
[t] I Bought This Phone....
##AND I LOVED IT! this is the best phone ive ever had
##it is so light and sleek
##its worth every pennie
[t] Motorola RAZR V3 Phone
##I have the phone and it is okay
##It is a bit big though, even though itz thin
[t] not for phone, for not working here
##it doesnt work in pittsburgh
##it would have been a really cool phone
##but it doesnt work in pittsburgh
##why not make it work nation wide?
##now i need to get a crappy 50 dollar phone instead of a nice one like this
##other good phones have bad plans that are too expensive
##this has a good plan, but it doesnt work here
##THANKS MOTOROLA
[t] For the price...
##Yes this is an amazing looking phone
price[@][u]##I get comments on it all the time, but for the  and the features i dont think the phone is worth over $100
##If you have the money then buy it, but the free phones w/ 2yr work just as good
camera[@]##This phones has a nice camera w/4x zoom but no video funtion, and the speaker is nice and clear on it
##But if i could go back in time to when i purchased it i would have rather gotten the free phone like my two sisters did, and leave with money in my pocket
[t] high cost & no headset wow
##nice phone very thin but so wide, non sense
price[@]##high cost then no headset included dont buy at current price
##In few months it will be free with 1 year contract
##I,m still amazed cingular didn,t offer a headset with phone
[t] V3
##This is a great phone however it is lacking streaming video
##Yes it will play small video trailers and music videos
##But it is lacking the quality of other contenders in the same high end market for the top of the line tech items
##Motorola should have learned by now what the people want and what they will pay for
##These phones unlocked will work with numbers of providers and as to the lack of video it makes up for in quality of manufacturing and the style is sleak and futuristic
[t] Junk
##I must say that the Razr is another product in a bad line of phones from Motorola
##I thought that given all the hype about this phone, it would be pretty good
sound[@]##I got this phone for $200 and had it for about three weeks and then all of a sudden, there was always a buzzing sound in the earpiece whenever I used it
sound[@]##After I had enough of the buzzing sound and terrible reception, I returned it and got another one
screen[@],sound[@][u]##The new one not only had the buzzing  and bad reception, but also the screen had a bunch of noticable lines across it which was very annoying
##Having had enough of this phone, I decided to to get the Sony Ericsson Z500a for only $50
##The Z500a is not as fancy as the Razr, yet it's performance and reliability are light years ahead of the Razr
[t] WOW!
##I ordered one for my wife and now will be ordering one for myself
##I'm a real estate broker; the voice features, viewable screen, Bluetooth and other things make this a great phone for my business
service[@]##The only downside is the digital phones still have some blank service areas where the tdma system has greater coverage
##But in town it rocks! I still give it a 5 star rating
[t] It's cool, and it's small, but the UI sucks!
##I'm bummed I bought this phone and will never buy another Moto phone again until they change their UI
##The phone is fine, it's good, whatever, throw another UI on there and it'd be 100x better though
##The address book? Yeah, it can only store one number for each name
##You know your friends (or more importantly work associates
##) that have a cell, a home, a direct work line, a company main line, a fax line, oh and don't forget the email address you like to keep on your cell phone too, just in case you need it, yeah well, you need to have their name listed once for each item listed there
##"John Doe" shows up five times, sheesh, almost every name in my address book shows up at least four times
##Ok, if they changed the UI I'd like the phone more, but still this phone is lacking in some areas
##Where you ask? No removable memory card! I'll never buy another phone again that will not let me upgrade the amount of memory the phone has for photos, videos, ringtones, and address book entries
##I thought I could deal with a Moto UI and the lack of removable media but I cannot
##If I could take this phone back and get a different one I would
##As soon as my contract is up, I will
[t] Motorola V3 RULEZZZZ
##I have owned Motorola V500, V525, V600 and MPx220, and I could say that the Razr V3 is the best of these phones
##It has a very slim and innovative design, it comes with a full flat keyboard completely iluminated, very soft and precise buttons
##A big and high resolution internal screen, full color display in images and pictures
##Very good reception and an incredible speaker
##The audio quality is very good even with the speaker that is enough loud for conferences
##Good external display, 4K colors, images are displaying very good quality
##Not too bad camera, but could be improved, very delicated, have to be careful when carring
##I love this phone, Motorola is improving its phones pretty faster
##HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
[t] Reception & Video Recording
##The reception is not what I had hoped it would be
##The reception is usually very good but, when I would go into a store there was a drop in signal strength making it hard to hear calls let alone talk to someone
##Maybe the reason is that the Razr is almost always, if not entirely, made in China
##Motorola should have followed Nokia's lead and had them produced in the Americas, like the Nokia 6101/2, which I wound up switching to after all the difficulties with the Razr
##I can say that the reception is better in Europe and Asia, though not very much
##Also, the Cingular Razr doesn't have the video record capability that the T-Mobile Razr does so I would recommend buying the Razr from T-Mobile
[t] Imperfect but not bad
sound[@]##Nice feel and good sound
##I can make calls when my friend's new Nokia GMS is incommunicado
software[@][u]##The USB is nice but I cannot charge from ANY old USB port - the  must be loaded on the PC first
##BIG PROBLEM if you want to charge that way at work or on the road
##The Moto wired earpeice is huge and has a clunky cord
##So bluetooth is the only read optoin
##Buy I hate having a transmitter against my skull
##A Nokia-like slim wired earbud would be great
[t] Great?
##I bought this phone and had it for a day but decided to return it
##It just wasn't what i expected
design[@][u]##The  was okay but the keypad was a bit rough
##I didn't think that it was worth what i paid
##and it wasn't very user friendly if a person hadn't ever used a motorola before and even for me it was a bit weird
[t] Form and Function - Motorola's Best
##I have been a long time user of Motorola phones because I find that they often have the best signal strength
##The RAZR is no exception
[t] Port Your Old Number - You Lose the Rebate
##BE CAREFUL!! If you have an old existing phone number and you want to bring it to this new phone - IT WILL VOID THE REBATE!!The only place this is mentioned is at www
##amazon
##com/keep-your-number
[t] WARNING - ROTTEN BATTERY LIFE! Great form factor!
##The #1 reason to buy (and keep) this phone is the slim form factor
##Let's face it - for guys who don't like to keep the phone on their belt like a pager, a pants or suit pocket is the only option
##This phone is far and away the best one in that regard
##I forget it's there a lot of the time
##It is also built EXTREMELY solidly, and does NOT scratch easily, although the SCREEN scratches easily
battery[@]##However, the battery life is terrible
##I literally have to charge it every night after less than two hours of talking with bluetooth
##You MUST get the car charger immediately
##Even though I had bought one on the internet, I couldn't wait for it because the phone kept dying so I raced to a local cingular store for an intermediate car cord
##The Motorola HS-850 BT headset is great but occassionally loses connection w/the phone, which is frustrating
size[@][u]##The only reason I kept this phone is the 
[t] Most Impressed
##So I went ahead and picked up the new Motorola Razr V3 cell phone
##All in all, I've been pretty impressed with the phone and quite surprised at the reactions I've been getting with it
##The phone is a bit expensive but it's intended to be an exclusive phone and is priced as such (so says Motorola)
price[@][u]##The retail  is $600 (without a calling plan - $500 with 2/yr agreement) but now that I'm a Cingular employee since AT&T; Wireless got bought, I'm now entitled to a 30% discount on devices
##That takes the phone down to $420 which is still more than what 80% of the populace is willing to pay for a cell
##If you're familiar with the Motorola V600, you'll get used to the Razr pretty quickly
##The OS has been updated from the V600 and it's a lot more stable than the V600's
##I had the V600 for a week and it had already crashed on me, been a week now with the Razr without any issues at all
##Things were getting too quirky with the V600 and I wanted to get rid of it
##I picked up one of the first versions of the cell and it seemed to be pretty buggy
price[@]##When I was shopping around for the Razr, I was in the middle of sending a text message to a co-worker giving her the price of the Razr when I received a call
##It started playing the mp3 I had set up as the ring tone but the phone never actually said I was receiving a call
##So it kept playing the ring tone
battery[@]##And kept playing it! I turned the phone off and it was still playing! I had to pull the battery out to shut the damn thing off! About once every two weeks, the V600 would either freeze or reboot
##Still pretty early, but so far no such issues with the Razr
##The one thing I was possibly concerned about is having to get the Razr unlocked because it was exclusive to Cingular and I had an AT&T; Wireless SIM
##I like my AT&T; Wireless SIM - I get unlimited minutes and data with my employee account but if I migrated to Cingular, I would be limited to 1,000 minutes a month
##With some of my work telecon calls, I could be pushing that each month
##Fortunately, the phone either came unlocked or allows AT&T; Wireless SIMs
##It's still geared to Cingular's network so I had to manually configure the connection to mMode
##The Razr is one hell of a sleek phone! First, it's extremely slim (why it's called a "Razr") and it's light
size[@]##The key pad is a single sheet of metal which helped keep the size down
##This cell was even more appealing to me being a Tron fan
##So, I went to the mall to try out the phone to see how other people reacted to it
##In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?", one guy offered me $300 for it, and the ladies at Starbucks went crazy over it
##Last year, if you wanted to pick up chicks, you'd take your kid or pet to the park
##Now you buy a Razr
##I was standing in line at CostCo the other day playing a game on it to pass the time and a guy in another line asked me about the phone
screen[@]##One feature with the phone that I'm not so sure about is the screen itself
##It's reflective qualities differs from the left/right viewing angle so your left eye actually sees a slightly brighter picture than the right
screen[@]##The end effect is that the screen has a 3D feel to it, but it also feels like you're watching it through a pair of red/blue 3D glasses
##The external display (which can display photos of people calling) could be a little better quality, the colors seem a little flat
camera[@][u]##I haven't tested the  out too much yet but I suspect it'll work like the V600
##The specs on the V600 claim that it has a 4x zoom
##No, it doesn't
screen[@]##When you zoom in, it simply crops the picture a little closer to the center so it doesn't have to scale as much to fit onto the screen
##Holding the V600 stationary, I snapped three pictures of my calendar, a 1x, 2x, and 4x
##I placed the 4x in the center of the 2x and the 2x in the center of the 1x - and the end result looked just like the 1x photo
##The audio of the Razr is outstanding as well, surprisingly since the phone is so much smaller than the V600
##The max volume of the V600 is the mid-level volume of the Razr
##The speaker phone is clearly heard over a large area at max volume
sound[@]##People I've called said that I sound clearer as well
##One reason I switched to the Motorola V600 was because it's signal strength is very good, kind of important when I don't get good cell reception at my house
##Likewise, the Razr's is just as well even though it has no visible antenna
battery[@]##The battery life exceeds even the V600's long life, advertising 6-7 hours of talk time
battery[@]##Using the Bluetooth headset over a concall (which drains the battery nearly 50% faster), I was able to maintain a call for three hours without issue, even with weaker reception
##So if you have a few extra bucks to spend or having problems picking up chicks, you may want to consider the Motorola Razr
[t] not as impressed
##First impression, surface area is larger than my current Samsung i600 which is a large phone but depth may make up for that
##The phone is nice and light
battery[@]##Beware, this is not cased entirely in aluminm as I envisioned from the Motorola description, it has an aluminum battery cover over the top half of the back and the front of the flip; the rest of the phone is typical cell phone plastic
##I would estimate that the phone is 60% plastic on the outside when flipped open
battery[@][u]##The aluminum  cover does not fit well and has to be forced down to cover the lower outside seams
##So far, I am not at all impressed with the craftsmanship of this highly touted flagship
##I will update my review and adjust the star rating accordingly after I have charged it and had a few days of use
##ok, so I have my phone charged and have had time to fiddle with it
##The reason I orignally chose this phone was for bluetooth in the smallest form factor I could find and I will give it high ranks for this
##I have been using a Samsung i600 smartphone that has integrated Microsoft Outlook, Calendar, and Contacts but made for a very large phone
##With this phone I can now take my HP iPaq with me when I need email and sync over the bluetooth connection and leave the bulk at home on the weekend when all I need is a phone, This is working beutifuly and I am very pleased with the functionality
##I still give the phone low grades for construction
##I have had samsungs for my last two phones and a Motorola before those
##As with the last Motorola I owned years ago, this one has an extrememly flimsy flip joint that seems destined to break
##It already has a significant amount of play in it when opened
##To make the matter worse, the phone has had all of the quick buttons that are normally placed on the sides of the lower half of the flip (where you hold the phone) placed on the top instead
##Beyond thea complete ergonomic blunder, the buttons are very hard to press in and if the other side is not supported by your hand, the entire top of the unit kicks over to the side at the flip joint
##Enough said in the other review about the usual lacking sense of the Motorola menu system
##One additional missing feature (may be in there but I can't find it anywhere) that I thought was required in the US now is the location based 911
##My last phone had this with the setting of on all the time or only when dialing 911
##All in all, it is a sleek looking phone with the great added benefit of bluetooth but packs the luggage of Motorola's deficient attention to sturdy construction and ergonomic controls
##I would recomend waiting for the next version of this phone or for a Samsung equivelant if I had it to do again
##&#60;update&#62;Had the opportunity to experiece two 'drop tests'
##Dropped once from waist level onto hardwood floor and once onto concrete
battery[@]##Neither drop seems to have affected the phone although the concrete did knock the battery cover off but it went back on with no misfit
##Bluetooth has amazing range; extends beyond my 802
##11g when syncing to my iPaq
##The woindows Pocket PC 2003 contacts menu item to dial via bluetooth works and is a nice substitution for the lacking phone contact storage when I have the iPaq handy
##Still very disappointed in the Motorola menu system but this is my only lasting complaint at this point outside of the amount of plastic construction
##The Cingular network is operating very well in the my area of the country and has better coverage than Verizon since Verizon gave up analog
##I have had a few reception problems but not as nearly as many as I have become accustomed to with Verizon over the last year
[t] A very good cell phone, but...
##This is a very good cell phone and Amazon
##com gives the best deal
##But, you can't transfer your old phone number from different provider to Cingular through Amazon

##This phone has everything one can ask for in a phone and more
screen[@][u]##great looks, bluetooth, BIG  with hi resolution, speaker
##And surprisingly it fits in the hand perfectly
##unlike some other "BRICKS" out there
service[@]##And for a change, with I am able to get service in my apartment which was a big pain with t-mobile earlier
software[@][u]##Few cons though, which made me give it four stars- Foremost, it still has old 
##for example, you still cannot store more than one number type in one name
##it creates duplicate records
##I have heard something about 3D address book
##but atleast in Cingular phones it is not available
##Plus
##not a single fully functional game
##only ONE demo (at least from Cingualr)Also, with a phone so expensive
##it doesn't come with its CD to synhronize address book etc
##you still need to shell out another $30 or so

##In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike, the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such
##If you're looking for a feature rich phone, then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less
##But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams, &#34;look at me, I'm a sexy b*tch,&#34; then the V3 is up your alley

[t] good phone but no accessories
##i have had this phone for 2 weeks now and i liked the look and feel of the phone
##i use the phone only as a phone and not as a digital camera; so i will not comment on that
##good
[t] Great style, not exactly a mobile swiss army knife...
##I've had the phone for just over 5 months now and I have to say I'm pleased with it
##However, I'm a light mobile user
##I spend on average about 30 minutes on the phone on any given day
##This phone is definately an attention getter
##It's sleek, stylish and very uncommon in it's appearance
price[@][u]##However there is a  to pay for the "bling factor
##" This phone is by no means a swiss army knife of the phone world
##The phone let's you take half way decent pictures, use blue tooth with great clarity, make people jealous, play real mp3s for ring tones and play a few java based games
design[@]##It's ultrathin design meant whittling the memory down to about 5mb
camera[@]##The camera function is pretty easy to use and can be operated whether the phone is flipped open or not
##There is not much storage space, as mentioned above, so you will have to move pictures off or delete frequently to leave space for other features
##The phone does have a photo caller id feature which is a nice to have
##The bluetooth on the phone is a great feature to have
##It seems to shock everyone when they see such a slim phone beam wireless voice streams 15 ft away
##The voice on the headset is crystal clear and the party on the other end can hear me fairly clearly
##There a few quarks with the blue tooth
##For some reason I'm constantly mating my motorola bluetooth headset with the phone
battery[@]##Also, the battery takes a beating when using the bluetooth
##Overall, I'm satisfied with it's BT performance
##The phone will play real mp3 songs as a ringer
##It's a pretty cool feature and definately sounds better than midi sounds
sound[@]##Even other colleagues here that have phone which also play mp3s always comment on how clear my ringers sound compared to theirs
design[@]##The design and styling of the phone is very unique
##I particullary like the almost all metal casing
##It's usually cool to the touch
##The bottom portion which house the antenna has to be made of plastic for obvious reasons
##The keypad is metal and does not give as most would expect from other phone keypads
##It takes some getting used to at first
##The backlghting on the keypad is great, and uses the technology found in Timex Indiglo watches, very clear, even, and bright illumination on the keypad
##If you're a perfectionist the fact the phone doesn't close flush may get to you
##The flip portion of the phone has mini rubber feet in the inside and it keeps it sticking a milimeter or two
##I can live with it
screen[@]##The outside mini display screen is not high res but still it's color
##It is also protect with a glass cover instead of plastic
##This phone does not scratch easily!The volume on the phone when I first got it was particularlly weaker than I enjoy
##A quick google search and I found a few utilities that let you 'realatively safely' correct the factory settings
##Please do any mods with extreme caution
##The navigation menu on the phone is pretty intuitive except for the phone book function
##At first it would appear you cannot have multiple phone numbers for a single contact but that is not so
##You have to use the grouping function to have multiple numbers for a single name
##Please search the manual for more info
##The games on the phone are ok at best
##I rarely ever play them so I won't leave any more comments on the quality
##The reception on the phone is good to very good
##I've had phones with better reception but I've had many many more with worse signal quality
##It doesn't have a calendar function or much room for many pictures, multiple mp3 ringers or many voice dial entries
battery[@][u]##The  life is decent for light to medium users
##It's not feature rich, but it does have some new technology showcased in the phone that allows for it's thin profile which definately adds to it's cool factor
##In conclusion, this is a great phone for "guy who always have the coolest gadgets
##" If you're a heavy cell phone user and enjoy scheduling features, etc, this phone is not for you
##Stick with PDA phones if that is what you're looking for
##However, I really enjoy this phone and it's a great conversation starter at bars and clubs
##; ) Enjoy
[t] Not all I had hoped for
##I've had my V3 Razr (w Cingular) for around a year now and have been content, though not thrilled with it
sound[@],battery[@]##My main issues are with sound volume and battery life
##If I'm in a noisy room or on the street, I often have trouble hearing the person I'm speaking to
##I complained initially about this and the Cingular rep said that I just needed to put the phone a little lower on my cheek, that never did the trick
battery[@]##Also, the battery life is short and unpredictable
battery[@]##The battery display will often say that the phone is either very low or very high (3 bars is fully charged, 1 is low), then will move quickly from a 3 to a 1, or will move from a 1 to a 3 if I turn the phone off and back on to reset it
battery[@]##If I spend much time on the phone, I have to recharge it once every day or two, which if fine when I'm at home, but a pain when traveling, and the varying battery gauge makes it hard to be sure that it's charged if I'll be out for a while
##Also, despite the thin design, the width keeps it from being a small phone, which is fine with me, but doesn't really mesh with the advertising pitch
##On the positive side, it's sleek, has held up through a couple of times being dropped, has a decent speaker phone and has (standard) handy alarm and calendar functions
##All told, I wouldn't buy it again, but I haven't been so upset as to return it
[t] Motorola RAZR V3
##I recently purchased the Samsung P777 and unfortunately, it broke twice (I say its unfortunate due to its great look and functions), and it was time for a switch
##I now have had the BLK RAZR for 3 days
##Here are some pros and cons (Keep in mind, I am 15 years old, and my viewpoints may be different than those of an adults')
screen[@]##Pros-Looks (shiny keyboard, ultra-thin, not too wide)-Speakerphone (very loud)-Reception-Nice color screen-Voice Dialing-Sound quality-Seems durableCons-Decent camera-No video recording or MP3 player-Lack of memory-Time is hardly visible on the outside screen during standby mode-Speaker volume is a bit low-Battery LifeI give it 4 stars because it lacks some features
battery[@]##My biggest complaint is the battery life, but just charge it every night and that problem is solved
##Overall a good phone
##Although it lacks some features, it is worth $200
##If your looking for a phone that looks good but lacks some features of a high end phone, then this is for you
[t] A Road Warriors Cell Phone
##I got one of the first Razrs from Cingular so this isn't an "I just got it yesterday and love it" review
##I've used it for ~8 months, traveling all around the states and world, dropping it several times, talking on it in the rain in Scotland, passing it through airport security dozens of times and taking and receiving hundreds of calls and texts
##It works better than any of my previous phone
##(Cingular coverage sucks sometimes, but the phone is always great)
##The Razr does all the things a cell phone should do and fits, truly fits, unobtrusively in your pocket
##I hated the belt clip holsters and all the other inconvenient ways to lug around the bigger (all other) cell phones
##This one slips away in shirt or slacks pocket, doesn't get caught on coats, seat belts and doorjabs and is always at hand
##I'd like the new 1
camera[@]##3MP camera and the MP3 capability of the newer versions and when I lose or break this one I'll get another
##Just what I wanted
[t] Overall a pretty good phone
##I received my RAZR near the end of June 2005
##In that time I have dropped it twice, once on a concrete warehouse floor and the second time out of the window of my semi tractor, after uttering a few nasty words, I picked it up and it worked fine
##As to the issue of signal strength, I have used it from Bismark ND to Boston to Miami and rarely have trouble making calls, The browser also works well in most places, including PA Amish country
##Besides it does look pretty cool
##I only wish I would have waited for the black one
[t] Too expensive!
##Razr V3 is the latest in the Moto lineup of flips
##Pro's,1
##It has all the latest features you would expect from a top end 2004 phone
##2
design[@]##Very thin and sleek design
##3
##Loud volume on the earpeice
##4
##Nice reception and no external antenna
##5
##Quad band for use around the world, once unlocked
##Con's,1
##It costs half a grand!2
size[@]##Not impressed with the wide size
##When put in pocket its large surface area is a hindrance
##3
##Awkward to hold while talking and also dialing
##4
##The body material although light and slim is still unimpressive IMO
##V60 had much better finish
##5
screen[@]##Constant buzz is heard from the screen when making calls
##6
##Menu system is still very crappy
##Not at all intuitive, takes longer to a simple thing
##7
##No T9 for SMS text messaging
##8
camera[@]##Poor camera quality (as is the case with most of the current phones)
##9
##Below par handsfree quality
##10
##Phone available only with Chingular contract
##Motorola has a habit to pricing their new flips way beyond the reasonable range
##V60, V70, V600 and now Razr V3
##All started in the half grand range and drop to realistic prices when the hype dies
##I would say save your money or buy something worth it like an iPod mini and/or a Sony Ericsson/Nokia phone
##Edit
[t] Razr meets my expectations
##What a GREAT cell phone
##The LCD is crisp
##The menues are easy to use
##It has plenty of storage space
battery[@]##The battery life is pretty good
##The clairity is much better than average
##The bluetooth feature functions flawlessly
##The speakerphone is perfect
##Downloads are faster than usual
##I'll try to think of something negative and let you know later
##After 60 days, so far so good
[t] Piece of junk
##I bought a RAZR V3 when I switched from Verizon to Cingular due to pricing structure; I am very sorry now
##This phone has so many basic problems that it is hard to believe this is not a phone from 20 years ago
##I returned the first one, but the second one has the same problems
[t] Good Phone, Not so great Toy
##I'm on my second Razr in three months of ownership
##The first one malfunctioned after a day in my pocket, and I had to send it in under warranty
##The keyboard was all locked except for the on/off button--I was told by Moto that this is a malfunction that they get frequently
##So the first thing I'd mention is little durability
##Second, it's a bit buggy and awkward to navigate
##For example, if you want to turn your phone on vibrate in a meeting and it is on a ring mode, there is no quick way to do it, and more importantly no silent way to do it
##You must click approximately three buttons to go from "Loud" ring mode to "Vibrate" mode, and each click involves a noise equal to the ring setting at the time
##So if you're called into a quick meeting at work with your phone in your pocket, and it's not already on silent or vibrate, you either have to embarrass yourself by making noticeable loud technology noise, or you better pray no one calls
##Another problem I have had with both Razr's I've owned is the retention of data in games
##It came prepackaged with a Golf game, that unpredictably and periodically deletes all settings and progress you've made--I still like the game so I've built up my character a bunch of times, but it would've been nice to be able to keep my character for longer than a week
sound[@][u]##Another consideration regarding java / gaming apps is that there is no way to turn off  on the application, i
##e
##, the only way you can do it is within the game itself
##It makes noise even if you have all functions on your phone on silent
##And if that game plays music every time you turn it on, well then, you can never play when you're supposed to be quiet--there's no work-around to this
##Another minor quibble I have is the proprietary head set, if you lose your headset, then you're going to have to search and pay a premium for a new one
##The phone is also very very slow
##There is a 0
##5 to 1
##5 second lag with every key you press, so say you need to open up the contacts, search for a name, open the name, then dial a number, you're looking at about 5 to 10 seconds minimum to begin to connect
##This is a far cry from my old LG, which response time was virtually instantenous
##The process to do a three way call is cumbersome and time consuming as well, with noticeable lag in between each step, and you can't link the calls until both are connected
##On the bright side, however, is that the phone is super thin and fits very very well into my pocket
##It feels as if it's built sturdy
##It's plenty loud and I never seem to have a problem holding a audible conversation
##And seems to get pretty good reception
##All-in-all it's a great "phone," and although packed with features, it's downsides can outweigh the potential upsides of the features, and as such it's not such a great "toy
##" I'd only recommend this phone for someone who could really get a lot of utility from an ultrathin phone (e
##g
##, someone who's carrying a lot of crap in his/her pocket)
[t] Cons more than the pros!
##A stylish phone that has some good features
##I feel that these are overshadowed by the unreliable working of the RAZR
##I guess, I can easily substantiate after 7 replacements in 7 months
##The heights of replacements - 3 defective phones in 3 days
##I doubt the quality process followed by the manufacturer
##It looks like a bad attempt to manufacture a world class phone with all the hype associated with it
##It manages to meet the expectations in few departments
##Reception, Battery Life and mainly reliablity of RAZR V3 is hopeless, backed by its fragile nature
##So be ready to buy atleast a simple casing for the RAZR else you will be out of warranty replacement and be stuck with a bad phone for two years if you signed a contract with Cingular
##I liked the speaker phone and also the mp3 ringtone player
##Bluetooth connectivity is decent
##But these are good if the phone itself works as it supposed to
software[@]##The proprietary USB cable and software is an added cost
service[@]##This has too many service related problems
##Amazon promptly replaced the phone as and when problems crept up (4 in a month)
##But after the "one month" trial period, the buck has been passed to Cingular Warranty Service
##Spent almost 9 hours trying to get a working replacement
sound[@][u]##Sorry if I  harsh! But it is a fact
##The reliablity of RAZR can be easily rated in the negative if allowed
##On one hand Cingular trusts the manufacturer blindly to supply phones to be sold or replaced, and users like me get a string of defective replacements
##I too fell for the looks and promise of superb functionality when it entered the market, now I am wiser
##If you are planning to buy this phone, be sure to read reviews from users both positive and negative before you take the leap
##Given a choice now, I would gladly opt for a different phone from either Nokia or Sony-Ericcson
##Update
[t] For business users and techno fanatics exclusively!
##The Motorola V3 looks and feels amazing
##It is definitely in a league of its own, especially with the declining quality in Motorola's mainstream telephones
##I purchased this phone for $500 CAN (approximately $410 US) and it came with the leather carrying case, Bluetooth handsfree, and all the usual accessories
##On the negative side, the keypad is really tough to clean
##Some reviewers have mentioned the unit's low volume, even at the maximum level
##I agree with that remark, the "sweet spot" is tiny and you must press your ear against the unit in order to hear clearly
##However, if you really like this phone, I don't think any of the above will keep you away from it
##I'd buy it again
##Today's Motorola phones all feel so cheap and the RAZR V3 is the exception
##It is a bit expensive but part of the pleasure is to know that you won't see every 15 year old kid with it
##It is a unique and distinctive piece of technology
[t] Way too much for a not very exciting phone!
##Purchased this phone recently because I was interested in Bluetooth wireless headsets and this was one of three that support Bluetooth at Cingular
##The phone works better than my previous Motorola phone, and it fits nicely in a pocket
price[@]##The Cingular knucklehead insisted that a two year agreement is required to get this wonderful price of $499
##00
##Why do I listen to those guys!Now, at $499
##00, it's not such a great phone, item for item
##I like that there is no antenna to be near ones brain so it's less likely to cause brain cancer (jawbone cancer????) This phone is a good phone, but for $500
##00 it's a rip off
screen[@]##I'm planning a trip to China in February, we'll see if the GSM really works very well from the third world! Even if it does, there is no really good reason for me to call from China anyway so who cares! The screen is terrible in bright light
screen[@]##In fact, you can't see anything in bright light except a black screen
battery[@]##Switching the Bluetooth on is a pain, but it is better to do that than leave it on all the time as it will drain the battery VERY quickly if you are not using it and leave it on
##While it's a good phone, the after purchase feeling is one of getting ripped off
##I realize people don't like to tell other people when they paid WAY TOO MUCH for anything or that the item purchased isn't very great, but this is the only way I can get it off my chest and possibly help someone from making a mistake
##There is nothing sexy or particularly high tech about this phone to make it worth $500
##00
camera[@]##And by the way, the camera is really awful at a max of 640x480
##And the Voice Dialing does NOT WORK with numbers stored on the card, only the ones IN THE PHONE taking up more memory for that feature if you want to use it with your Bluetooth headset! What's that all about! Engineering has not done all that much here!The Bottom Line
[t] Fancy yes, but not worth it
screen[@]##Okay, it's really cool that the screen is pretty big, the pictures are really clear for a phone and the phone is really stinking thin
##All that being said, if you need a basic phone to talk on, this is not the phone for you
##And definitely not at the cost of it
##Unless you have the phone pressed as close to your ear as possible, it's hard to hear the other person
##As a topper, it's either an expensive handsfree or another expensive handsfree (neither of which fit smaller ears)
##I'd rather I had stuck with my v551 bluetooth
[t] this phone is way to fragile
##I had the phone for a month and was satisfied but when one of my friends dropped it it broke
##this is an ok phone but just be sure not to drop or it will break the second it hits the ground
[t] razr v3
##the best motorola phone made!i have had many and this is there best effort yet
##it all works like it should and the bluetooth is well made and voice dial is the best i ever had
##and the thinest ever
[t] Great Phone, Great Look, Great $40 Price!!!
##I think this is a good phone
##I owned a Moto V551 and this is almost the sameexcept it lacks as much memory
screen[@]##This phone has some good skins, themes, features,and a huge screen
camera[@][u]##It's  is great considering it's only a VGA
camera[@]##I owned aSony Ericsson T616 and that camera stunk, I'd take this one over my old Sony
##It could use more memory but overall it's a pretty good phone, especially whenyou can get one for only $40
##(
##)I'd be happy to help you out
##There are better phones out there but this wasn'tmeant to be a "Top of the Line" phone
##It's an awesome looking all metal phone,get one if you really want one!!!
[t] Ok phone. Cool design, but nothing wonderful.
##Bought this phone(Actually the black v3 but the only real difference is video support and additional memory), for $149 from BB, replacing my v551, basically just for the "chic factor"
##Initally I was very happy and excited with my purchase, but after a couple of weeks the novelty wore off and its shortcomings became apparent
##The biggest issue I have is being able to hear through the earpiece
##Unless you ear is EXACTLY on a random "sweet spot' good luck hearing in anyhintg but the quietest environments
##I even removed the little "M" circle with little or no help
screen[@][u]##The second shortcoming is the the 
##While it has more colors available than the v551 the resolution does NOT look nearly as good
##And if you are viewing blacks and not looking directly at it, you get a wierd grey-black thing going on with one eye
##Kind of hard to explain, except for those of you with the phone
screen[@]##Much to my dismay the screen is actually WORSE than the one on the v551
camera[@]##The third is the camera
##I rarely use a phone cam, but the times I needed it, the pictures looked, well
##horrible
##And last but not least, the reception
##The reception is not as good as everyone makes it out to be
##The v551 actually had better reception
##My new LG CE500 actually has MUCH better reception and is generally a much better phone
##This phone is a GOOD phone
##Nothing more nothing less
[t] The New Motorola RAZR V3 Won't Cut Into Your Wallet! It SIZZLES with FEATURES!
##I've had so many poor experiences with cell phones, that I'm finally thrilled to own a phone that meets almost every need I have! In addition to having about 90% of the features that I require in a nice phone, the Motorola RAZR V3 is extremely attractive and is very affordable
##The phone does NOT feel like a toy and I don't think you'll have to worry about breaking it with great usage
##It's a Motorola phone that has been designed to deliver all of the "goodies", but focusing on quality
##I've experienced only 4 calls being dropped in a 4 month period
##The clarity of calls is unsurpassed, as far as my experience goes, and the controls on the side of the phone (volume, etc
##) make it simple to make changes to your current call
##You won't be fumbling around and you'll find yourself wondering how you could have ever carried a different style flip phone in the past!Everyone has certain features that they like to have in a cellular phone-some many focus on ring tones, while others require that their phone have a speaker phone
##Choosing a good phone can be frustrating and often quite confusing
##It helps to listen to others who have already bought the phone and are now locked into whichever Cellular Phone Agreement that applies to them
design[@]##As far as design is concerned, the V3's surpasses the typical clamshell design and raises the bar to a higher level with the impressive aluminum construction
price[@],button[@][u]##You'll enjoy a very large color display (176 x 220)with 220,000 colors-yes, 220,000 colors! The outside cover has a full color display (98 x 80)and will allow you to see Caller Information, Photos, Signal Strenth and the Time! With too many features to tell you about, you'll find most all of the phones features and on-screen menus by utilizing the sleek 5-way center  on the backlit control panel!The price through Amazon and through some other sites are incredible
##I tried getting the same phone through the provider I have and it was about $99
##00 on sale
##I chose to purchase it online and agreed to sending in the Rebate-which was promptly sent to me
##The phone is not perfect
service[@]##If you buy a Motorola RAZR V3 and have any problems with service or the phone, contact the seller or the service provider
##There is ALWAYS a chance of getting a "Lemon", but don't let that totally discourage you!
[t] Good Phone
##Ive had my razr for about 4 months now
##at first it felt like it would break easily but its pretty solid
screen[@]##My one complaint is the screen
##Somehow it got really scratched up and all kinds of dust got behind it which i cant figure out how to remove
##good phone though
[t] Crap!
##Great looking, great screen, nice and big
##but
sound[@]##there is a high pitched sound in the ear piece
##Sounds like your brain is being zapped with radio waves or Microwaves
##after 3 months it had to be repaired twice by Moto and it still stinks
##now T-Mobile will send another one
##refurbished of course
##waste of money!
[t] Terrible phone
##This phone is horrible
##Period
##I first bought mine from a Cingular employee I know 8 months ago, and since then, I have had to exchange it out three times
sound[@]##Anything from low sound volume, not showing voicemail messages, not receiving calls when there are 5 bars showing, not being able to call when there are 5 bars showing, dropping calls, and not sending or receiving text messages has plagued all of the four razr phones that I have had
screen[@]##In addition to this, dust accumulates in both the front screen and the inside screen
screen[@]##This makes it nearly impossible to see what you are looking at on the screen when outside in sunlight
##The razr I have now is the last one I will ever get
screen[@]##This is partly due to my utter dissatisfaction with the phone, but also due to the fact that the front plastic screen has a minor crack in it, and Motorola will not exchange it out even though it still has all of the problems listed above
##Save yourself the money and go with a phone that actually works, and will work longer than a couple of months
[t] This phone is a lot of fun.
##I have had this phone for a couple of months now, and couldn't be happier
##The fact that amazon can sell these with rebates that make the phone free was what sealed the deal for me
##Mobile Phone Tools is a must, you need to get the CD, ir really unlocks the capabilities of the phone, you could check ebay for some great prices that include the cable to hook it up to your computer
screen[@],software[@]##This will allow you to put video on your phone, mp3 ringtones, wallpaper and screen saversThere are several additional pieces of software that will allow the phone to capture video and you can install games on your phone and all at no cost to you
##The functionality of the phone is great as it allows the synching of the phone with outlook, for contacts and calendar issues
##Adding any new files or information to your phone can be done with your computer, so you don't have the issue of entering information by hitting the number keys on the phone
price[@][u]##I would highly reccomend this phone, free is also an excellent 
[t] Form over function
##I really expected to love this phone
##And if I only had to admire it from an aesthetic point of voice, I would love it
##Too bad the phone actually needs to be functional
##Here, in a nutshell, are the reasons I will never again be seduced by a form-over-function phone
[t] Best Cell Phone Ever
##I love this phone, we have 2
##The voice recognition is perfect
##The only thing I would add is more memory so that more than about 20 numbers can be voice dialed via Bluetooth
##I use the HS85 series Bluetooth in my car and it works perfectly with the phone
service[@]##I could not be happier and the service from Cingular has been superb
[t] IT BREAKS ALL THE TIME!!!
##Ok, so I bought into the hype about the Razr when it first came out
##Now, however, I HATE THIS PHONE
##IT HAS CAUSED ME NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS
##Due to the fact that it is so slim, the wires are super thin as well and constantly break
##It costs a lot to fix, including a day off of work to travel the extensive distance to someone who knows how to fix it
##Then I finally got fed up with the phone breaking and decided to buy a new one, a completely different brand, but Cingular said I wasn't ready for an "upgrade" so I had to pay full price! I got screwed
##beware the Razr (and any Motorola products for that matter--their Blue Tooth headsets are no better!!! Even my boyfriend who works for Moto won't buy their products!)
[t] Excellent form and function
##There isn't much to say about this phone, its extremely small, easy to use (both the keypad and the interface) and is reliable
##I don't end up using all of the features of this phone but I can say its been a very user-friendly expierence so far
[t] Happiest cellphone purchase in ages
##I'm a high-volume user - on the phone all the time
##Its been a few years since I've found a phone that I really dig
##I dropped $1000 on the first Nokia slide worldphone available in the states, another thousand on the second one, etc
##I buy new cell phones when good ones come along that I like
##I have the BLACK RAZR and while I'm not accustomed to Motorola's user interface, and the iTap seems a little bit of an extra step in messaging, I LOVE this phone
##Its smart - it picks up my headset whenever its in range automatically
##It can handle my 500+ contacts, it gets voicetags right, its got a speakerphone that's seriously useful in the car checking voicemail, and I LOVE how it expands when its open to become kind of a full-sized object instead of a microtiny too-small-for-your-own-good kind of phone
##I love everything about it
##I only wish the menu system were slightly more customizable, but this cheap purchase has made me happier than I've been with the crap phones I've had to put up with since my two great Nokias in the last two years
##If you don't have one, GET ONE!
[t] Awesome Morotola Razor V3
##It is the thinnest, lightest, most practical mobile I have ever owned
##It fits in any pocket and is not noticeable
screen[@]##It is sleek, stylyish, has all the features of the V600 but also includes a larger, inner LCD, color screen
##The light touch keypad is also a wonderful addition and the characters are large and all light up
##The ringer is louder than that of the V600
##It is overall a wonderfull mobile
[t] Phone is very nice. Cingular service is very bad.
##I had this phone for a few days and I really liked it for what it is
design[@],size[@][u]##The main advantage of the phone is the design and the 
##It fits nicely in pockets and you forget it's there
##Functionality is ok - you've probably already read the specs
##There are phones out there that can offer more on that side though
##Here comes the bad part
service[@]##Cingular service was way below my expectations
##The reception and the quality was very bad
##Phone calls were dropping on a regular basis
service[@]##Customer service wasn't very helpful either
##Eventually, I had to return the phone
service[@]##Currently I use T-mobile with Motorola A630 and I am very very happy with the service
##If T-mobile has good reception in your area then that is the way to go
[t] Great phone..
##The RAZR is by far the most sturdy phone I have ever had
##Made of aluminum alloy, I have dropped the phone numerous times and not even a scratch
##The only thing I don't like about the phone is the address book
##It list different phone numbers for the same person as a different entry
##It makes a large phone book virtually impossible to scroll through
##But this can be solved by using the voice command function
screen[@]##I also don't like how the screen gets dirty all the time but you can clean it whenever
[t] would get 5 stars but cost took a star off
##I like this phone, but i got mine for free in a contest
service[@]##The cingular service is much better than of other providers
##What I like about this phone is that you have a color outside screen, it has a plasma screen, the pictures are wonderful on this phone, the phone is thin (i guess thin is in), and for caller id, you can see who's calling if you set up the picture function
##However, if you do this you have to save the number to the phone instead of the sim
##I like the bluetooth capability, mainly because if you have a computer with bluetooth it can connect to the razr
##The keys are chemically etched
price[@]##One thing i don't like is the price
##I know it has fallen, but to replace this phone if i lose it would be $400
##For the money, if I were to want a replacement (budget), I would take the v551 which has a lot of the same features, but it is economical compared to the razr
##This phone is cool no matter what
[t] Motorola Razr V3
##The small and sexy v3 phone is the ultimate in celluar technology
##I love my razr phone and I have found it extremely useful in everyday situations
##Besides the fact that every time I walk down the street I have to worry about a $500 invesment in my pocket, the phone easily impresses all of my friends with its lavish features including a camera, video camera, bluetooth, voice dialing, large color display, and many other featueres
##This phone is a little small buts its very nice to have
##I reccommend its its great
##-Plsailboy
[t] Great look##yes I agree with most of you
[t] Like every other Motorola phone.
##Okay my mom Bought the RAZR and i bought the sony ericsson z500a and the ericsson is 10x better
camera[@]##The RAZR does have a really good camera though
##But the RAZR has virtually no additional features compared to the other MOTO's! DON'T BUY IT!
[t] Show Off Phone
##Ok i bought this phone when it first came out yes it was 500 dollars with a plan
##i had to have it but then the negatives cam such as it was to thin couldnt feel it in you pocket so you would constintly have to feel for it, then again sometime when you would wear tighter jeans the phone was to wide and it got annoying
##The phone is also not that durable yes i am a human i drop things and when i droped this phone it would break
camera[@]##the camera was a good one and i loved the video feature
##however after breaking this one i got a motorola v220 and was much happier it had most of the same functions but yet its more durable like i can drop it and not worry about it and stuff like that so over all if you have the money and you want a phone to show off then get this phone its for you
[t] Great reception
##We live in a "low to med
service[@]##" coverage area and this phone provides service in areas most other phones do not
[t] Worst Service I Have Ever Gotten From Amazon
service[@]##Bought this phone with Cingular service
##I needed the phone in a hurry
##I checked my order next day, had this weird message
[t] No problem with keeping my same old cell number
##I purchased a cellphone on Amazon
##com that had a rebate
##When I got the phone I called T-Mobile and had my number moved over to the new cellphone
##I then sent the rebate information out and received the rebate about 6 weeks later
##I encountered no problems with getting the rebate of with transferring the number from Verizon to T-Mobile!
[t] WOW!
##The picture on amazon doesn't do it justice
##This phone is HOT! The body is solid and the innards do amazing things
##Anyone that can afford it should get it now
[t] Beware AT&T Customers!!!
##While AT&T might have been acquired by Cingular, their systems are not integrated
##I had an existing plan with AT&T and bought this phone since my physical bill now says Cingular
##When I tried to put my existing SIM chip into the Razr, it displayed "contact Service Provider" when I turned it on
##After calling AT&T support, they say that I need to spend an additional $25 to get a Cingular SIM card - that the AT&T cards don't work with this phone
##!!!!! BEWARE of the hidden costs!!!!
[t] HAD TO HAVE IT
##Left T-Mobile to Cingular
##Had to Have the RAZR ! The phone rocks and is so hot to have
##Everyone comments on it
##easist speakerphone and best quality on cellphones today
##Remember you only go around once
##You ain't coming back
##GET RAZR'd !
[t] A look good and a feel good phone!
##I got Motorola V3 as a replacement for Nokia 6600
##So for me the "bulge" factor is very important
##I am getting 'almost' the same functionality with 1/4 thickness! The thing I miss the most is expandibility! Dont care mcuh for the lack of video capture
##Other than the size, the definite pluses of Motorola over Nokia is the iTap messaging system
##I found it very convinient and user friendly
##Moreover, the unit paired up with my computer using bluetooth without an issue
##I have had trouble doing that with nokia
screen[@]##The screen is clear and crisp (though if you are looking for a good imaging phone - look else where - may be Sony Ericsson K 750i), the key pad is nice (not cramped up) and the speaker phone is of good quality
##The phone has voice activated dialing
##In short this one has all the good "phone features"
##It is a smart looking phone - not necesarily a 'smart phone'
camera[@]##And dont get it if camera quality and video capture is important to you
price[@][u]##The  is high but I guess is already coming down
[t] Great phone
##After 3 yrs of the Sony Ericsson T68i I had enough
##I decided it was time to get a new phone and this is the phone I had been waiting for
##It is a flip phone, but it is so thin that it's thinner then 99% of the current phones out there
software[@][u]##The  is fast unlike the Sony T68i and since it is a flip phone my hands don't cramp up when using it
##It is so light that you don't even feel it's in your pocket
sound[@]##The graphics are amazing, and so is the hifi sound
##The phone feels very solid in your hands
##Looking at the T68i makes me laugh now, it feels like a kids toy phone
##Remember how revolutionary the startac was?? Well, Motorola has done it again, they are back
[t] Yes! You can use your own mp3's for ringtones
##Just got the phone so here are a few of my first impressions
##1
ringtones[@][u]##YOU can use YOUR mp3's as 
##I havn't heard this discussed before
##It took me a few hours to get it working right
##Im using a mac, and isync (with bluetooth) works well
##With Bluetooth running on both, and after setting it up in the bluetooth preferences on the mac, from the bluetooth icon on the top right of the menu bar you choose Browse device and select the phone
##From here you can drag and drop audio, picture and movie files from the computer to the phone and vice versa
##mp3's are a little trickier
##I used a program called audion to open up an mp3 in its editor
##From here you can erase portions of the song you dont need and save it as an mp3 for a ringtone
##This still results in a large file size, so after you save this smaller version, you can open it again in audion and use the encode feature to reduce the recording quality, from say 128 bit to 64 bt, and adjust the stereo setings
##From this point, you just have to drag the encoded file from where it was saved on your computer to the bluetooth file transfer browser
##This sure beats paying $2-$3 for a crap ringtone, especially when you can buy a full song on itunes for $0
##99
##I had tried using quicktime pro to select the song portion i wanted, but was only able to save the file in a
##mov or
##mp4 format
##Both of these versions are not recognized by the phone
##2
##The phone book really sucks, I mean I could not imagine a worse one
##I 'upgraded' from a siemens sl56 that is 2 yrs old with a much better phone book
##You can not save multiple numbers to the same person (they are copied and show up as duplicate names with the differing numbers in your address book) You can not input physical addresses, or birthdays
##3
##The display is completely illegible in direct sunlight (a problem if you use your phone outside in a sunny area such as florida) This is in contrast to my sl56, the display of which is just as legible in the dark as in full sun
ringtones[@]##I thought of returning the phone when i discovered that you can not email youself riingtones (midi) files ( according to cingular) No way was I going to pay for ringtones
##In the old days, before cell phones, you could easily find midi versions of tons of free midi songs on the net
##These are the same type used by cell phones today
##4
##Regarding the size, it is a little bulky, and not easily opened and closed with one hand
##In contrast, the sl56 slider phone was very easy to open and close with one hand and i never felt like i was going to drop it while opening it
##I'm comparing it to the sl56, because the razr phone is supposedly also classified as an ultra small phone
[t] Buyer beware.... this phone is Fragile!
service[@]##I have had my phone since Mar '05 and it has been in for service twice, once for a cracked lens and now for moisture problems
##Both times the phone was in my front pocket wasn't dunked in water, etc
##I am not hard on phones
service[@][u]##I had my previous StarTac phones for about 4 years, no  problems, but it was starting to wear out
##was having problems sending/receiving calls
##If you doubt what I am saying, drop this phone or go jogging with it in your shorts pocket
service[@][u]##it will soon be in for  (or just plain OUT OF SERVICE
##Save your money
##go elsewhere
[t] over-rated but still a good phone
##I've had my Motorola Razr V3 now for 6 months
##I rely on it as my main business phone, I'm an attorney
##I've roamed with it around the USA, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia, Italy, Spain, and France
##Works fine
battery[@]##What I don't like is the Bluetooth is too gimicky and the headset battery is short lived
##Not real intuitive how to seriously use the bluetooth
##My biggest gripe is it supports only simple call forwarding on/off
##My much cheaper Nokia supported call forward if busy/if not answered/etc
##The SMS message memory is way too small
##I've recently started to use the GPRS with the USB cable to my laptop
##The Motolrola Phone Tools is a disaster
software[@][u]##Cingular call manager is far better, throw away the Motorola 
[t] Hate this phone!
##It's very difficult to hear on this phone
##It was in the beginning and now more so only 7 months later! I'm about to get yet another new phone b/c this one is "unable to charge" now and I can't be w/o a phone while motorola decides what to do with it
##This is the 2nd motorola to do this
##My last one I would have to hold the charging plug into the phone to get a connection
##That one unexpectedly died on me, taking a bunch of non-SIM numbers with it
[t] Good phone and stylish.
##Ive had this phone for about a year and if you haven't bought one by now you're not going to get any wow factor that it had originally
##I got some looks at first but, there are too many now and if you want a rare and stylish new phone, go with the SLVR
##Im changing to one in a month
##Anyhow, the phone is great looking first of all with some very good features
##It has no antenna which is good and you dont even feel it in your pocket
screen[@],camera[@]##The camera is decent but, it makes up by having a beautiful large and vibrant screen
##The speaker is loud and so is the phone in general
##Bluetooth works for up to 30 ft and really is great if you are in the car
##This phone is a bargain now at $50- $150 with a plan so if you thought of buying this phone, you should!
[t] Great Phone
##Great Phone
##Wanted the V3i with itunes but I hear the official US release is on hold
##(Who knows why!!! Crazy
##The US is the itunes capital of the world!) Was going to go for the V3c but I heard Verizon hacked the phone and limited some of Motorola's intended features
##So I went for the older V3 from Cinglar
camera[@]##Sure it doesn't have an MP3 player like the V3i or the upgraded camera like the V3c but its still a great phone and works well with Cingular in south jersey
##This is by far the best phone I've ever owned
[t] way overhyped
##This phone is way overhyped
##Its features do not justify its price, this phone's primary purpose is to make a fashion statement not innovate
##I'm glad I changed this phone for the truly supererior moto Mpx220
design[@]##Which has expandable memory, mp3 player, megapixel camera, windows 2003, bluetooth, video playback, Quad band and its unlocked, and I like the design much better and its much cheaper
##The Razr has no expandable memory only 5 megs
##It is Quad Band
design[@]##It has a Thin but flimsy and still bulky design
##Reception is ok but I like the Mpx220 better in that deparment
screen[@],price[@][u]##The only thing worth mentioning is the screen which is gorgeous truly impressive but still does not justify its 
##It has bluetooth but so does the cheaper moto V550, and v600
camera[@]##The camera is not even megapixel
##It can only playback videos not record them
price[@][u]##This phone's  needs to come down, its way overpriced for the mediocre features it posses
##Again do not buy this phone, unless all u want to do is show off the amount of mone that was thrown away on this phone
##But my Mpx220 out does this phone any day of the week, as do other less pricey models
[t] Advantages are obvious, but ...
##The advantages to the RAZR are obvious
[t] Paying for the looks only
##I got this phone about a week ago and sure, it's thin, it's cool looking but in the end, it's just a phone
##I was deciding between the V3 and a nokia 6230
##I really think i should've gone with the nokia
##- The V3's speakerphone isn't that loud
##I turn it on and end up turning it back off because i can hear better without it
##- The phone has a slim profile but it's actually pretty large
##it's just thin
##When it's open, it looks huge against your face
##- The buttons are flat and takes used to using
##This is especially true if you like to text message a lot, like me
software[@]##The upside to this is that Motorola's iTap software is really nice to use compared to my old samsung
screen[@]##- Yes, it has a large screen
##but when you use it, oils from your face get all over it
screen[@]##the oils from your fingers get on the keys which transfer to the screen
internet[@][u]##- no games unless you want to connect to the 
##BUMMER!!- crappy ring tones
##again, you'll have to pay for better ones
##The nice thing about cingular is that yes, you have good reception, mobile to mobile, and rollover
##The bad thing is they totally rip you off in text messages compared to t-mobile
[t] Early adopter
##Updating my previous impression
software[@]##Reinstalled mobile phone tools software and haven't had any problems with crashing anymore
software[@]##Still the included lite version of the software is fairly handicapped, and Motorola requires you to pay if you want the fully automated version (unlike Nokia), so I leave my rating at 4 stars
##I've had no problems with the top being flimsy
##In fact, I think it's sprung quite tight to the open and the closed position
##The flip doesn't rock from side to side at all, in fact there is NO play on the flip in the open or closed position on my phone
##I would wish for more user configurable menus, that and a memory slot considering this is one of Motorola's top-of-the-line phones
[t] Happy
##I bought this becasue I was very happy to see a phone with a metal case again
##I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me
##Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away
##The best phone I ever had
##Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos
##Really big disapointment
##Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia
##When this came out I jumped on it
##Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones
##PROS
[t] Third Times a Charm....I Hope!
##I recently "upgraded" from a Sony Ericsson T610 to the Moto RAZR
price[@]##I receive a %40 discount on Cingular phones through my employer, so the price was not a problem
##The features are nice, I've been able to save money on games, wallpapers and ring tones by utilizing Bluetooth and a P2P network
screen[@]##The screen is big! Overall the phone is sleek and thin
screen[@]##However, I feel the T610 has an easier user interface and is able to screen calls
##The first RAZR was fine for the first 72 hrs
##and then the send key began to stick
##I returned to the store and exchanged it for another one
service[@]##Needless to say the customer service rep was not happy he had to provide me with a brand new replacement phone
##In effect he threw the phone and SIM card on the counter and walked away
##I took the second RAZR home and made sure to give a full charge
screen[@]##The first time it was turned on the screen display began to flicker
screen[@][u]##It would stop, but occasionally bars would appear across the 
##I bypassed the store this time and contacted Cingular directly
##The CSR arranged for an exchange at a different store, so I could avoid the last experience
##Now I'm on my third phone and subsequently have become an expert at reinstalling my phone list
##I would recommend locating a copy of Mobile Phone Tools for use with the RAZR, as this program allows you to sync your address book and calender
ringtones[@][u]##Also, it has a media program in which you can create your own MP3  and image capture for wallpapers
##In summary I would not recommend this phone to anyone
##I purchased a Moto V551 for my wife at the same time as the RAZR
##This phone has all the features of the RAZR and video capture
sound[@][u]##The V551 is half the cost of the RAZR, reliable, better  and uses a standard Moto charger
[t] Great Phone with some added features (V600)
##Despite on what you might read in these reviews this phone is a great upgrade
screen[@]##I recently upgraded from my V600, the V3 is a bit wider as some may have noted several times but this gives you a larger screen to view
##It has a better color resolution than the V600 with some added features
[t] Early adopter
##You have to be an early adopter to pay this much for a phone
##I bought an unlocked phone to use with my T-Mobile SIM
##My phone came with a lite version of mobile Phone Tools and a USB cable, earbuds, leather holster with removeable belt clip, and charger
##Goods & Bads
[t] Average functionality, poor durability
##I got the Razr from Cingular 10 days ago
##It ran $200 with a 2 yr contract
##That seemed a bit steep, but it looked like a nice phone with the features I wanted
##I got it home and got it set up with my numbers/personalization/etc
software[@][u]##I was surprised to see the  was identical to the V400 I had a couple of years ago
##Initially the phone seemed great
screen[@],camera[@]##It's visually stunning and has a huge beautiful screen with a decent VGA camera
##It's very thin, but fairly wide
##The speakerphone worked great and I was able to set up my bluetooth earpiece with no problems
##I found it slightly annoying that the V3 is the only phone Motorola offers that uses a mini-usb connector, so accessories are hard to find
##Reception is average
##I had several dropped calls, but that could just be my area
##I got over these minor complaints due to the wow-factor
##Yesterday I started having problems
##I was expecting a call and when I hadn't received it by 5 I checked my phone only to find that it was powered off
##I tried to turn it back on and it wouldn't respond
battery[@]##I had to take the battery out, wait a few minutes and put it back in before it would turn back on
##After that it started resetting itself about 1 out of 10 times I opened it
##Cingular was great and they offered to replace it with a new handset with no problems since it was in the initial 30 day grace period
##They did tell me that the Razr is the only phone on which they don't offer insurance, which doesn't inspire confidence
##I went with the Nokia 6230 which is smaller overall, has more features and just seems to be more durable
software[@][u]##Overall I'd say the Razr is a nice phone with good features, but Motorola needs to work on their 
##If you're looking to impress people, this phone is great
##As far as features per dollar, there are much better phones out there
[t] Keeping your number & anyone smell that???
##If you want to keep your current cell phone number and want this phone with Cingular Wireless, please read this!!! I recently bought this phone through Amazon
##com (no offense to Amazon, because I am a regular customer & I love Amazon's service) but I was forced to return it because I ended up with 2 cell phone numbers (my AT&T; and new cell phone with this Razr V3)
##I thought it wouldn't be a problem to buy it online with the new number they provided me because I thought that it would be easy to later port my current AT&T; number to the Razr V3 just by calling the AT&T; and Cingular later
##I was wrong
##In the beginning, it was a hassle trying to reach customer care with either carriers (voice automated) but when I finally got through, cust
##care themselves didn't know what they were doing/talking about nor fully understood my situation
##I had to explain again & again because they were confused with which number is which but I finally got transferred to a customer serv
##that fully understood my situation & guided me through my ordeal step by step
##She even called a nearby Cingular store for me while I was on hold and explained the situation to me & had a SIM card ready for me to pick up
##It was obvious that Cingular wanted me to buy it from them directly because when I went to pick up my free SIM card, I was told that they do not know how to port the my current number without having to cancel the new number Cingular gave me
##I decided to cancel the new Cingular number in order to keep my current number and obviously, go through another phone calling experience with an upsent agent asking me why I bought the cell phone through amazon
##He told me that he will not charge me cancellation fees & other taxes if I returned the cell phone and bought it in the Cingular Store
##To confuse me even more, he told me return my cell phone to a Cingular Branch in Texas! He gave me the Return Dept
##address and said that he'd be expecting the phone in 3 days!!!
service[@][u]##another confused customer 
##Of course I didn't return it to Cingular because I bought it through Amazon
##Duh!The bottom line is
[t] Amazing!
##I have been waiting for this phone for over a year
battery[@]##My last phone worth buying was the Motorola V60, every phone since then has seemed flimsy and a waste of good battery
##My friends have gone through phone after phone, they fall apart after a five foot drop or submerge in water, not the v60 and hopefully not the razr
##Its amazingly slim, almost the thickness of a cd case
##The screens are bright, and razor sharp, no pun intended
camera[@]##The camera is at least somewhat useful and has a 4x zoom
##The phone is almost as cool as my Japanese's interns, it looks as though we are almost catching up
##This phone is awsome
##The mp4 video is awsome, more storage would have been nice though, maybe a sd or cf storage? I guess that's what the pda is for
##Still a sleek and powerful phone
##500 bucks though?! give me a break, check out www
##wirefly
service[@]##com you'll find the same phone with loads of accessories for about 399 with a minimum 12 month service contract
##Worth every penny!
[t] Not as good as I expected but it is still very good
##It is light and stylish but it is not as good as I expected (misleaded by the TV commerical)
##I am still trying to get the bluetooth working with my PC (it is working fine with the bluetooth headset)
##It cannot find my Bluetooth USB port but my Nokia was able to find it
##Cingular requires you to sign a 2-year contract but some independent stores require you to sign a 1-year contract only (like the one inside Fry's)I bought the phone from Buy
##com - big mistake
##They said I would have $200 mail-in rebate
##When I received the phone, I got a $100 mail-in rebate form instead
##It didn't seem to be the right form
##I emailed and called Buy
##com several times (they made you to call different phone# and some of their people couldn't understand the situation) and they "guessed" I was missing another $100 mail-in rebate form
##They told me the rebate dept would contact me in 4-5 days but I have been waiting for more than a week now
service[@]##Their customer service was bad and the response was slow
##I got 2 cellular phones from Amazon
##com
service[@]##I received the rebates quick and they have much better customer service (and response) than Buy
##com
##I will never buy any cell phone from Buy
##com
[t] worst phone I've ever had
size[@]##You think it will be great because of the features and size but this is garbage
##If you accidentally drop it, it falls apart
battery[@]##The battery that came with the phone is the worst I've ever had
battery[@]##Within 6 months of having it I noticed the battery getting weaker and weaker
##By the end of the 1st year I could only talk on it for about 20 minutes and it would be dead
##After that about 5 minutes of talk time and it would shut off
camera[@]##Worst pictures with the camera on it too
##There is no flash
battery[@]##The music sounds ok threw the head phone but if you want to use it for an mp3 player you better keep it plugged into the wall outlet because you won't make it threw one song without the battery running out
##I got this phone for free and would rather pay for a phone the get this one again
[t] The Razor! It'll cut your time and wallet in half.
##Pros
[t] DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!
##I've had to buy to RAZR phones this year and the same thing happened to both of them! THe side piece comes out and a cable inside snaps and the phone stops working
##It costs about $95 to get this piece fixed
##And Motoroa refuses to take responsibilty because they always blame it on you dropping it however my second one was only 3 months old and I didn't drop it but they still won't fix it
##so DO NOT BUY this flimsy phone from a company that doesn't take responsibility
[t] Minor Problem is Major Headache
##Who thought it would be a good idea to prevent people from turning off the hideously annoying start-up and shut-down sounds? Why should I have to download a program and hack into my own phone to turn this totally useless feature off
##Shame on Motorola
##Shame on AT&T
[t] Love My Phone
##Pros
[t] Great features, if only it would work as a phone
##I have/had two of these phones, from two different carriers, two different stores, bought at two different times, one a V3 and the other a V3t, one for me, one for my wife
##Very sleek, very nice features, beautiful to look at, passed the WAF (wife acceptance factor) with a score of 10, etc
##My only beef with it is that the it does not have good reception
##We live on the side of a slight hill so the signal strength is not great
##On the first floor I get one bar on occasion, on the second floor usually one, sometimes two
##I almost always have the call dropped though
##I have had other people here with Nokia and Samsung phones, they consistently get two bars and rarely a drop
##Some of them even call from my basement, where I consistently got no bars, i
##e
##no connection whatsoever
##I called tech support, they had me go select the tower manually, which happened to be a Cingular tower
##I couldn't even get a signal long enough to register with the tower! Finally tech support suggested I get a Nokia, the 5300 was said to be good
##Not anywhere as cool, but I need a phone that works
##To be fair I had somebody, with a Razr, here the other day that had US Cellular and they had two bars in my basement
##He reported excellent coverage with his phone
##Could it be that the GSM versions are not as good?
[t] innovative
##This phone was very well designed and meets the needs of a majority of the user market
##However, I was disappointed by the difficulty of synching the calendar with my Outlook
##Nevertheless, its the lightest gadget I carry around now and it just looks good!
[t] The Famous ''dust under the screen''
screen[@]##I have had my Motorola V3 Razr for about three months now and dust has gotten inside the screen, so i took off the screen protector and i cleaned out all the dust, but when i put the screen protector back on more dust had gotten behind the screen, i found the problem and it was because dust had been sticking to the glue used to hold the protector in place, i've heard that a new protector is only about 4 bucks so i plan on getting a new one
##over all i think that the razr V3 is a good phone and mine only costed me 100$ CAD from rogers, i have always had 4 phones in the past 3 years about all being flip phones so in the future i plan on purchasing the ''motorola slvr(sliver)''
[t] Low Volume is a killer...
##I've had my RAZR for 2 weeks and the low volume when you are on the phone makes me consider returning it
##I've set the volume to the highest setting and I can barely hear it
##I've never had problems with hearing on a cell phone
##Since this has the "bluetooth" technology I tried the "free" headset I received
##Nice idea but it sits outside your ear making that low volume still hard to hear
##It's a pretty phone and it works ok but this lack of volume is a deal breaker for me
[t] Not perfect but worth the money
##I've owned this phone for a few months and I still like it a lot
##It has a few downfalls, but gets looks from everyone
##It's slim style fits flat into your pocket
##which it a big plus over using a belt clip all the time
##Hearing can be a problem if your in a loud venue, this is my biggest complaint
camera[@][u]##The  is not great but is fun to play with
##The keys can be hard to touch sometimes if you have big fingers
screen[@]##The screen is hard to keep clean almost always, but is nice and big with plenty of color
##The charge it holds could be better but is not bad
##The exterior display is very nice
##My signal is good through T-mobile
##Some owners have problems with a squeaky hinge because they flip it open rather taking the time to open it slowly
##The metallic shell is durable
##Overall I have no regrets
[t] Good, but could be better
##Quality of reception = 5 Stars (I have Cingular)Phone key pad = 2 Stars (I feel they need to raise the buttons a millimeter or 2)Ergonomics = 3 stars (it is hard to open with one hand, but it is very thin and for a man this is nice for keeping on the belt)Camera = 5 stars (Has zoom and light and dark settings)Battery life = 4 (this seems to be good so far)I don't know if that averages out to a "3 star" or not, but this phone for all the hype should be better
software[@]##I would have also rather of went with Verizon, I cannot stand the on-screen software (not Motorola's fault), it seems like I have to push 16 buttons just to get anywhere
##I have not had verizon, but it has to be better
[t] A great cellphone!
##This is the very lastest in technology that money can buy, it' got everything
camera[@]##From a camera to organizing all your dates and events, this phone is great for those on the go people, with not very much time, but lots of things to do
##There was one thing i did'nt like about this phone though
##It's a flip phone, which normaly is quite stylish, but when you open this one out it's really big, really thin, but really long, making it look sometimes old fasioned to me
##Other than that this is a great product
##A cool querky desing makes it ultra desirable to the professional end of the market
##Overall, i really enjoyed this phone
##Well built, well desinged, and most of all, stylish
##Really, it's quite something
##Sam Worrall rating
[t] Nice phone, very intuitive, bright screen
##My husband and I received two of these last week (one silver and one black)
service[@]##So far, we have had no problems with the phones or the service from Cingular (we switched from Nextel)
service[@][u]##Cingular was able to transfer our old phones numbers over to these phones without an interruption in 
##I have not had any problems with the volume on this phone, as others have indicated in their reviews
##I have also not had any problems with dropped calls, as others have experienced
##The phone itself is very intuitive to use
##I have not opened the book that came with the phone and have been able to do everything that I needed the phone to do
##It is simple to input numbers into the phone book
##I also like the alarm function, which is also easy to use
screen[@],camera[@]##The camera function was very intuitive, as was changing the placement of the fuctions on the screen
##The phone is very slim and lightweight
##You can hardly tell that you have it in your pocket
##The speaker phone is very clear when you are in the car, or the office
##Much clearer than our previous Motorola phone that we had with Nextel
screen[@]##The screen is very bright, making it easier for old tired eyes to read it without their reading glasses
##Not that we are telling ages here
##At this point I am very satisfied with my purchase of this phone from Amazon
##If my opinion changes for any reason I will update my review
[t] Nice phone, reception poor, beware of the dust
##I like the phone - it's user interface is really great
##It's light, and durable becouse of the metal body
battery[@]##The battery lasts reasonably long
screen[@]##Beware of the dust, I had an unreadable display in 3 days time! The peel off the screen protector trick (see below) worked for me
camera[@]##You defitly want a case for this phone or you will have a damaged camera and lots of dust in no time
##Another drawback is the poor reception - where our nokia 1100 has full reception in our house, this Razor keeps losing the connection
##Now I fear the problem of the stinkin phone
[t] Thinness is its best feature (Razr v3) - Battery life, voice quality poor
##My main reason for getting this phone is for the thinness of it
##I like that I can slip it in my front pants pocket without a huge bulge
##I like it most when I'm not using it
screen[@]##The screen and keypad look good
##I got used to the shape and buttons but it still isn't as satisfying as holding a thicker curved clamshell
##The Vibrate is weak
##i have missed countless calls just because i didn't feel it in my pocket
battery[@][u]##The  has to be charged every day because if you don't charge it at the end of the day, it will die halfway through the next day
##It can't even make it 2 full days
##You make a 45 minute phone call and it is down 1 bar already
##I have found that you can only program one of the 4 buttons on the toggle
##The other 3 are for Get it Now, Open Wave, and VZCast
##I find my self mistakenly hitting these and going to these services I have little need for
screen[@]##The screen is nice and big
##I subscribed to Accuweather and the radar looked great
##Many of my friends have complained that the voice quality isn't good with the razr
##Some say it sounds like it is cutting out even though I had a lot of bars
##The OS seems a bit slow- you hit "contacts" and it takes 1-2 seconds to show up
camera[@]##The camera is not good
sound[@][u]##The shutter  clicks and you have to keep holding the phone steady because it actually takes the picture after the click
##Voice recognition works pretty well, especially handy with the bluetooth headset
##You just train it once during set up
##You don't have to pre-record names as with the older phones
battery[@],size[@][u]##The  is great, but I think my next phone is going to be basic and simple with battery life and reliablity the key
battery[@]##My friend with an old B&W; motorola says her battery lasts a week
[t] Why didn't I get it sooner?
##I took a long time to decide to buy this phone
##Many of the reviews I read were negative
service[@]##Although they also referred more to the service provider than to the phone
##As for the phone, it is just great
##I've had Sony Ericssons, Nokias, and now this one, and it is by far my favorite
##My hesitation centered on the fact that I didn't know how easy the menus were and for the phonebook, I wanted to have one name with several numbers
##If you are looking for this feature, let me reassure you, it does have it
##After you enter the first number,and the type (work, mobile), you keep scrolling down until you see MORE, and then you can add other numbers to the same name
##The design, the screen, the features are all great
##The one bad thing about this phone, is the manual
##It does not explain in detail how to do things
##For example, I found how to switch amongst phone numbers for the same person, by accident (when the person's name is highlighted you press the left or right arrow)
##In short, this phone is awesome
service[@]##If you can find a good service provider, then it's definitely worth it
[t] It is what it is...A PHONE
##I recently got a Silver Razr V3, I would have had one before but they were just too much money to have a cool looking phone
price[@][u]##Now that they are not as NEW and the  went down I decided to give it a try
##I have to say that the overall look of the phone is GREAT
##It is sleek and stylish and it suits me lol
##I see people complain of certain things about the phone, I guess it depends on where you live as far as reception goes, mine works GREAT
##Never dropped a call
##I can hear from it clearly
##The speakerphone to me is LOUD
camera[@]##It has a camera and video recorder
camera[@]##to me the camera is nice considering that it is a cell phone
##I dont use it that often but when I do, the clarity is good enough for me
ringtones[@][u]##The phone does lack , of course you can always buy them, but I had phone in the past 2 years that had decent 
screen[@],camera[@]##One thing about the camera that had me confused, but it only happened once, I went to take a picture and it gave me this scrambled screen and said picture failed
##I got scared for a second, then it went back to normal and I went on to take the picture again and it worked fine
camera[@]##This could have been a glitch on just MY phone so I wont complain that the camera sucks because it really dont
##The Video recorder is Ok, now again, this is a CELL PHONE
##This phone has been around for almost 2 years, stuff does improve over the years so I imagine the black Razr might work a bit better than mine, who knows, I never tried one
##I am sorry if I left anything out
##I like having trendy phones, but I am not very TECH Saavy
##I can use my computer and phone and hook up my own electronics, but I am not into all that HIGH TECH stuff
##This phone is a GOOD solid phone so far and I enjoy using it
##Oh yea, it does have Bluetooth for any that care
##I dont, but I am glad I have that option if I needed it
##I gave this a 4 out of 5 because I know it is not the BEST phone of all phones, but I think it is a very nice phone to own
[t] Great hardware with the worst software on the planet
##In short, this is a great looking phone that's practically unusable
##Here's the breakdown
[t] Good phone, but reception?
##This is a great, thin phone
##My first Razor had very poor reception and I had to return it during the initial 30 day period
##The new phone has good reception
screen[@]##The keys a are a little hard to read in sunlight as well as the screen
[t] Love it
##I have had the Motorols Razor V3 for about 3 months
##I have had no problems with it
##I have taken it everywhere Hawaii, Flordia, France, London, and the UK(and i only had like 1-2 groped calls over there) I would really recomend this phone to anyone
##and I love Cingular Wireless i had att wireless then they combined and it is even better
##The Bluetooth is easy to set up to
[t] Did It's Job, but may be time to move on...
##Well it's nearly time to get a new plan, my 2-year contract ends in July, and I'm already looking at phones
##This that I've learned along the way
[t] Cingular is terrible
##The phone looks cool and all but if you're going to use Cingular beware, especially if you're a former AT&T customer which was swallowed by Cingular
##Besides the trouble I had migrating my numbers on my family plan (at one point Cingular had me as dead and I had to physically go into a store and prove that I was alive)
##Now I am attempting to add a 5th phone to my family plan (you are allowed 5 phones on a plan)and they won't let me do it without me putting a $200 deposit for one year
##With AT&T I never paid late-I never paid late with Cingular-but they can't explain to me why they arbitrarily now need a deposit
##If you can go with another company DO IT
service[@]##Cingular's customer service is the worst
[t] Don't buy this phone
##Let's face it
##The only reason you're considering this phone is because it is thin
##If that reason ALONE is the only basis for your purchase, then it is perfect for you
##Otherwise, wait for a newer model or one from another company besides Motorola
##You'll regret buying this phone
##Complaints
[t] Razr is very fragile
##I want to warn anyone about this phone
##We have had three of them and all three broke
##We had one repaired in FL
##Cost about $100
##This phone is a loser
##get a V551 instead
[t] Software Issues, 'White screen of death ! '
##Dont buy this crappy phone
screen[@]##Its just been 3 weeks since I started using it, and I get a 'white screen of death' every now & then
##And then I have to reboot it to access it
##Called T Mobile, and even though its less than 30 days, they'll still charge me 10 bucks for shipping (to replace with a refurbished one)
##Thats fine but what if the new phone also has the same (or new) issues
##The best thing to overcome this problem is not to buy this phone
##Samsung is the best cell phone company
[t] great phone - may have some quirks
##i really am happy with this phone so far
screen[@]##i read all the reviews on here before buying and it seems that everyone either absolutely loves it or absolutely hates it! the only strange thing that has happened to my phone was that once when i answered it there was a lot of static and when i looked at the phone the screen went blank for a moment then came right back up to normal, kind of like a "reboot" - now, is this a motorola problem or a cingular problem? hard to tell
internet[@][u],software[@]##also a lot of people are complaining that the motorola phone tools costs an extra $30, well it does, if you buy it from motorola! we live in a really easy time to find anything we want on the  for cheaper people! look around! first i found TONS of people selling the software on eBay from anywhere to $1
##50 to $15
##00
software[@]##then when i did a google search on "motorola mobile phone tools" a few links down the search i found a message board website where people had listed links to download the software from their personal webpages so I GOT IT FOR FREE!!!!!!!! this software is a great tool! you canmake any picture you have in digital form into wallpaper, use it as the picture for your caller and you can edit each picture to look the best on the phone screen! you can also turn any song you have into a ringtone and edit it so the best part of the song is what plays when you have an incoming call
##also you can synchronize your phonebook to this application (great if you lose your phone, you won't have to recover all the contact info, it will be saved to your computer just by the tough of a button!) among many other things! so before you knock this phone
##READ the user manual! it is easy to use, and the mobile phone tools rocks too
[t] Audio Quality Very Very Very poor
##I had changed the Motorola Razr V3 phone in one month
##Both have the same problem with both of them
##The ear piece audioquality is extremely poor and extremely low
##It is like a sinusoidal wave and the audio level drops every few seconds and stays low for 10 seconds and then picks up
##I am not sure what to do now as I am past the initial 30 days and I do not want this razr phone any more (Two phones in a month exhibiting thesame problem)
[t] I don't know what crappy phones you've got, but mine is a good phone!!
##I think Amazon
##com got a bad batch of them because my phone is a lot different then yours
button[@]##The side with the big button with the dent in the middle is the volume when your talking to somebody (I use it almost every call, it might be because I talk to a lot of people that whisper, but it's still really cool) and when your not on a call, it changes the style of ring, vibe, vibe and ring etc
button[@]##and the other button is programmed and the button on the other side is voice recording which I never use but I might have to use it in a sting or somethin, who knows
##Anyway I've never really had a phone for a long time before this one, I had a Nokia and I felt I would be kicking myself later if I didn't upgrade
sound[@][u]##What I miss about the Nokia is when it rang it had these cool multi colored lights on the sides that when it rang or any kind of  would come out it would light up and the lights would rotate and stuff and it would look like a UFO!! The voice tag is easier to set up too but that's off topic, heh
##Anyway, the front I haven't seen a pic pop up on people that I have set on there with their pic + name
##The games are Java based and sweet, mine came with Billards, golf, skipping stones, mojo mixer, and slideshow
battery[@]##I never play them because they drain the battery
battery[@]##I think my phone is about 2 days battery life, 2 1/2 3 hours talk time
##If I talk for an hour and a half, 2 bars left
battery[@]##And then it lingers on 2 bars forever, then when somebody calls, it automatically starts beeping low battery
##Oh yeah, mine doesn't have a USB cable jack it only links up to a computer via bluetooth so I don't know what you guys are talking about with that
button[@]##I never use my bluetooth headset, it came with my phone (unicel) and the model I have (Motorola HS850) and I can't just put it on my ear and push the button when the phone rings, and besides for my work the main reason why I got this phone, I need to push the 1 key to get into the conversation so it's not 100 percent great for me but anyway with the boom out the light blinks and it annoys everybody that lives with me
##And I can't put it on in a frenzy because it's hard to put on
##And you have to link it to the phone every 2 hours or so
##It's not for me, but if you call a lot of people then it's a great thing because you can barely feel it on your ear, back to the phone the phone is light too, sometimes I have to put my hand into my pocket to remind myself it's there! It feels durable, the metal really does
##I have dropped it a few times, I feel that if I drop something and it breaks it's cheap
##I like the 4x zoom and the brightness, darkness while your taking a picture feature
##You can also record a video which I might do after I get the usb bluetooth adapter
ringtones[@]##I also want to download mp3's and use them as ringtones
##I can't think of anything else to say
##I got a decent phone, and I don't know what you guys got
[t] Don't buy from Amazon
##Amazon only has 30 days warranty on cell phones
##If any problem happens after 30 days, you are dead meat
##Stay away from Amazon
[t] Amazing Phone
##I have had this phone for little over 2 months now and have had not one problem with it
##Not only does it look amazing, but it's light and ultra thin
camera[@]##This phone also has a great camera that adjusts well in almost all lighted areas
##Pros
[t] Don't purchase this for voice or digit dialing
##I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710
##Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry
software[@]##The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software
##Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710
##To bad, the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me
##If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it
[t] Razor software Issue
battery[@]##I have heard numerous problems about this phone mine personally wouldn't let me call out unless i took the battery out and put it back in and my roommates who got the black would just reboot for no reason
##This sucks!
[t] Best looking phone!
##Its a real dream phone!! Afterall its a thinest cell phone any mobile company has ever launched
##Its black version also looks cool
##but silver one got a unique shine!
##Better have the leather carrying case available on amazon! Its a perfect fit!!The only complaint is Motorola doesn't give lot many options as Nokia does
##but
##Overall I am very happy with the product!
[t] Motorola Razor
##im 12 and got the motorola razor for christmas so ive had it for about a month it hasnt had any mager breakdowns yet well it wouldnt beacuse i only send about 1-4 texts a day and atleast 1 call a week but im forever playing with it which causes scratches and dirty marks that is the main problem with the motorola razor the screan on the front and the main screan im clening evry other day and trying to get the scratches if ur to get this phone you should think hard about getting a case b4 u buy the item the signal on the phone can be very low so you cant call any1 when its @ o or 1 but takes up to 5 mins to get its signal so not very good emergincies !! it has very good and brightscrean and pictures vidios or gr8
##bluetooth ive used once and doesnt work anymoreif u use ur phone constatly calling every1 every ten mins or texting u'll find the signal is rubbish but some times goodso the motorola razor is gr8 for people who dont use there phone to often like me xx - xx hope u get the phone and enjoy it i rate it 4 stars over 5 so thats pretty good but has some bad point s
[t] GREATEST PHONE OF THE YEAR!!!
camera[@]##This phone is sleek, stylish, and has many features!! It has a nicely placed camera and comes from an ok service, Cingular
design[@]##No antennas or things to get in the way, just razor looking design and sleek number pad
[t] Great and Slick Cell Phone
##My parents got this phone for my birthday and I love it
screen[@]##The color screen is vivid and really big and the camera's 4x zoom is nice
camera[@]##I would have liked to see more resolution in the camera though, it is not bad as it is
##The style of the phone is awesome, really hip
##I feel cool having this phone
##You can't go wrong buying this phone
##It's great!
[t] Best Phone I've ever had
##What more can I say about the Motorola RAZR except that is the best phone I have ever owned
##Without even mentioning the gorgeous slim and sleak look, the features are great
screen[@],sound[@],ringtones[@]##I use the Bluetooth, the camera, I bought a cable to hook up to my computer and make my own ringtones that sound excellent, wallpapers, and wow the plasma screen is incredible! The screen is so clear and gorgeous, unlike any other color phone I have ever seen or owned
##I never have a problem with a signal here and around my house, where with T-mobile I couldn't get 1 bar, Cingular and this phone I get 3-4 or more
##I would highly recommend this phone, with the current promotion that is going on now, it is a no-brainer!
[t] The Razr V3 is the Best!!!
##I first bought the V551 by Motorola which is an excellent phone!! But I noticed everbody had the same phone, at least in my area
##I usually like to have something different
##So at first, I did buy the phone because most people didn't have it because of the Price
##The sales person at Cingular which had the V551 told me their was no difference but an Internal antenna and less weight
##I've noticed the Camera is a Hell of alot better, plus the Battery life is by far longer than the other phone
##Reguardless of area, the Reception in almost crystal clear even in Roaming or long-distance
##I'll admit, I did buy it at first to have something different but I'm Impressed with the features in comparison to the other phones I've owned
##If you have the $$$ buy it!!!Hope this helps!!Mike
[t] awesome phone!
##this phone is great
design[@]##it's lightweight, stores 1000 numbers, has a slick design and display
camera[@]##just don't get it if you expect a good camera
[t] Techno nirvana
design[@]##American engineers are at the best when they design sleek products with simple functionality
##Forget about all the bells and whistles that clutter most electronics products
design[@]##This phone is the epitomy of space age design
##No other phone comes close in terms of the look and feel
##If you want a phone that is first and foremost a good phone and looks and feels cutting edge, buy this phone
##Update
screen[@]##The screen on my razor is now kaput
##7 mths of useful life
##not very good
[t] So far, so great!
##I've had this phone for a while now and here's what I think
##The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people, and yes, it's not as intuitive as say, Nokia's interface, but it does have some pros
##You can customize every button, including all 4 arrows, and the left and right soft keys
##I have my left soft key programmed to go to "Shortcuts" and I have every function I need right there
##And of course, after a while of use, you will get used to the interface
##The volume of the phone is decent
##I have no problems hearing other people, and they have no problems hearing me
##Speakerphone works great too
##My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he's talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls
##The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring
ringtones[@]##One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones
##The address book issue is this
[t] Look carefully at the "bad reviews"
##If you look carefully at these so called "bad reviews" you will notice most of them either don't know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone
##Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one
##Got BOTH for FREE btw
##Just a word about those of you like us that want a "shared plan" from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your "Cell phone Numbers" right then in the email
service[@]##I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a "single 700 rollover mins shared plan" before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect
##Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to "My Account" from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be
##As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular "in my area" puts out a great signal
service[@]##My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away "With NO ROAMING charges" btw our last cell phone service "Alltel" would have been roaming within 20 miles
##Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in "Speaker Phone" mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call "Mobile to Mobile"
##We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem
##She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly
battery[@]##Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000
battery[@]##I've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it "needs" charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it's new and 1-2 hours talk time
##Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke
##I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4
##99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved
##Someone mentioned something about the "address book being slow" not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno
##As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don't, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by "Name" or "Speed dial #" or "Voice name" or even by "Email" and with or without a picture of the person
##Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for "Voice command" it takes 1 sec
##Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for "list only" "no picture" and by "primary number only", simple
##You can also separate numbers even further by putting in "Categories" such as "Business/Personal/General/VIPs"Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category
button[@][u]##When you have "primary number only" listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to "Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation  to get all the other numbers" once again very simple and easy to use
##I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast
sound[@]##1-2 have mentioned something about "ear piece volume too low" the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the "volume" is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the "top edge of the phone", too low and volume will sound low
##Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used
screen[@]##Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose "PHONE" seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors
##I have only ONE complaint so far
screen[@]##The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under "sunlight" is virtually unreadable
##So there you have my one gripe
##I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone
##UPDATE
[t] WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
##for those of you complaining about not hearing so well with the phone up to your ear, look at the blue thing on top of your phone, that is a cover, underneath it is the speaker remove the blue cover and there you go, my friend who also has a razr did it, but i dont want to risk it, it should be silver underneath and you should hear better , this phone is awesome, i love it, only motorola could make such a awesome phone
##i love every time i take it out the attention i get, it turns heads i can't stop using it !the features are sweet, its high performance, great reception and everything,best looks, super thin "razr" thin,best cell phone ive ever hadi had it almost the first day i heard about itwhich was around when it came outdefinate must have
[t] Can't synch w/ Outlook
##Happy with the RAZR appearance
##Unhappy with the inability to synchronize my contacts in Outlook with the phone
software[@][u]##I called Motorola and the only way to do this is to purchase extra  for $30
##I can't say I am overjoyed at the thought
software[@]##Do a Google search on this topic and you will note that even this extra software does not work well
##What tricked me was this paragraph above, "Use the phone's Bluetooth capability to set up a wireless link with a Bluetooth accessory or connect to a computer or hand-held device to exchange and synchronize data
##The phone also supports the SyncML PC synchronization standard, can be used with Motorola's Mobile Phone Tools PC application to manage and synchronize contacts, calendar and other data with your PC
##"
[t] Works with Cingular Blue/AT&T!
##I wanted to pass along this trick
##This phone works with a blue AT&T; sim card
##I just found a reputable non-branded cell phone store (privately owned, not T-Mobile, Cingular, etc
##) where they did instant unlocking for a very reasonable fee (around twenty bucks)
##That did it! After 5 minutes and pocket change, my phone was unlocked and worked with my AT&T; sim card
##And, now I can put *any* sim card in the phone, not just Cingular/AT&T
##; So, for example, any European or American pay-as-you-go sim will work
##Very cool
##One of the easiest to open foldable phones
##For example, the seam between the two halves lets you slip a finger in to flip the phone open quite easily
##I loved my old V60 years ago, but my main complaint about that was you *had* to use two hands to open it
##When it was closed it was too smooth to flip open with one hand
##The Razr allows one handed flip - very cool
##My only real complaint is there is no headphone jack! The *only* port is a little mini-USB type B port, which is for charging, data transfer, and headphone plug
##But no standard 2
##5 mm plug
##Of course, it has bluetooth, so any bluetooth headset will work
##In fact, I use the Jabra 250v and love it
##It works really well
##But sometimes I like the simplicity of a *wired* headset, without having to worry about batteries, and that's the only area where the Razr stumbles
##I have yet to find any way to adapt a standard 2
##5 mm plug to the mini USB plug on the phone
##And the only headset available with a mini USB plug built in is Motorola's, and they only offer one, which is the little dangley earpiece kind with a dongle on the wire for the mic
##I really don't like those
##CONCLUSION
[t] Smokin hot!!!
##I waited two months for my previous wireless contract to end and basically went with Cingular just to get this cool looking phone
##I am not a fashion maven but the Razr is the sexiest cell phone ever designed
##PERIOD!!! In the week that I have owned it I have gotten envious looks from most people, and from friend and co-wrokers they all commented on the sleek looks
##Like a Ferrari on a Sunday drive, it's hard not to notice the Razr
##I was afraid that a phone so thin cannot possibly contain all the needed technology to do what it was meant to do, take and make cellular calls
##I was surprised to drive past the County Police barracks, a place where even my Motorola I730 would drop every call, and the Razr stayed true blue, the call stayed with me
screen[@]##The inner screen is bright and clear and the memory has upwards of 4 megs
ringtones[@]##That is enough to hold a truck load of pictures and downloads and ringtones if that is what floats your boat
##I love the ringtone that mimics the Motorola commericals, "Hello Moto!"There is even a feature where you can mix an dmatch your own sounds based off a standard ringtone
design[@]##You can design the phone's functions around YOU
##There are a ton of features that I cannot explain here simply because I am still figuring out how to use them
##I especially love the pictuer caller ID, sure beats having to read a number at a glance
##I am very pleased with my Razr and I am recommending it to anyone from tech-weenies to fashion mavens to contruction workers like myself
##This is one bada$$$ cell phone
##The cool factor simply cannot be denied
##Motorola, you have made a classic masterpiece
##Kudos

[t] Great Phone!
##I normally never really cared for Motorola phones
##Everytime I have had them with AT&T; the phone always froze and calls were always dropped
##This phone, with Cingular, is different
##I have had the phone for a little over a month now
##So far, I have yet to experience any dropped calls
##The reception is great
##The phone is beautiful
##It takes great pictures too
design[@]##The sleek design is very ideal for me
##It fits nicely in my small purses
##I do have some concerns though
battery[@]##First, when I use the bluetooth headset with the phone, the phone battery lasts for only about two days
screen[@]##Also, the outside monitor, on the flip, isn't nearly as clear as the picture on the inside screen of the phone
##Also, the keypad does get fingerprints easily (the phone came with a motorola cleaning thing so it really comes of easily)
##I am though concerned about dropping the phone on my tile
##The phone seems really delicate
##Using the bluetooth earpiece though allows me just to take the earpiece out of my purse and walk around with that
service[@]##Remember as with all phones, to occasionally power them off to receive updates from your service provider
##This will increase the phone recpetion and prevent drop calls
##Overall, I am extremely happy with this phone
##I encourage those who are interested in purchasing this phone to read other consumer reviews such as mine
[t] Best phone after a few tweeks
##I bought this phone to replace my failing LG phone
##Anyway, a few things right off
[t] Yeah, it IS small
##So, I haven't bought one of these yet, but I've seen some folks with them and messed around with it
design[@]##The phone's got a great design and it's really small
##Believe me, that part is totally cool
##But, other than that, it is a VERY basic phone
price[@]##That's a big price tag on such a basic phone
##Dig?
[t] Great Phone But Missing Software
##This is one great phone, sleek, light, small, thin
##Motorola got the form exactly right, just slightly larger than a credit card, and only a half an inch thick
screen[@]##The screen is excellent
##Motorola missed big time on this one, not including Motorola Phone Tools and a USB cable in the purchase - now how cheap is that
software[@]##I just spent all that money on a super exclusive cool phone, and they make me buy software for $30? That's actually kind of crazy
##They also messed up on the phone book
##450 Outlook contacts, that were spawned from 200 core contacts - each cell phone, business, email, and home entry for an individual is a separate entry
##Way way too unwieldy
##They need to update this error big time
##They've also missed on priority numbers - you know, you identify people you call a lot, and they go to the head of the list
##I'm used to the problems now, but wow what a miss on their part
##The camera, oh it takes pictures
##They look decent on the cell phone, but forget much more
screen[@]##The shutter speed must be very slow, you have to hold the phone solid to not get blurry pictures (when viewed on a computer screen full size) - on the phone they look great
##Overall - my nits are truely nits, this is one heck of a great phone
price[@][u]##If you're  sensitive, buy the V500 series
##If you want cool, get this one
##By the way, I'm a long time ATT customer and had no trouble (read it took less than 10 minutes to buy and activate this phone) with Cingular
service[@]##In fact the service seems better
##I just wish they would port over your voice mail
[t] Good phone if you want to buy another one sooner.
##I've had my phone for over two years now and I'm heading out to buy a new one (something other than a Razor)
design[@][u]##The Razor has a poor mechanical 
##I've dropped three times in the last two years and it's broken it twice
##Way too fragile for normal daily use
software[@][u]##The  is also pretty week
##It regularly needs to be shut down and restarted to that it will transmit multi-media messages
##I also didn't particularly care for the functionality of the buttons, but maybe that's just because I liked my Samsung better
[t] RAZR - Beware
##I have experienced a lot of problems with my RAZR phone
##I have had to send it back twice to the Motorola repair center
##The phone keeps losing its speakers so you can't hear anything
##Also, the address book is lousy
camera[@]##The only redeeming feature is that the camera is pretty good
price[@],service[@]##I am planning to buy different phone even though I still have about 1 1/2 years left on my service and will have to pay full price
##The guy in the store told me that they get the most returns on the RAZR than any other phone
[t] Amazon rebate ?
##I bought a Razr in Aug/Sep timeframe and then sent a rebate form promptly early in Nov and its been almost 10 weeks and am getting the run around
##I do not think Amazon has any reason to fulfil the rebate and am stuck waiting another 8-10 weeks
##Do not buy the phone if you are even remotely thinking of redeeming the rebate
[t] Good Phone overall
##I've had this phone for about 6 months now and overall it seems like a good, solid performer
##Two things could make this a great phone though
screen[@]##First, the screen is all but impossible to read in anything close to sunlight which makes it dangerous while trying to view in the car
battery[@]##Second, the battery life could be longer
##Although it depends on your use, overall it seems to need recharging more often than other phones I've had
[t] Don't buy it
##Although this phone is thin and looks nice
##I'm disappointed I bought it
##It just doesn't work well
##I agree with many of the negative reviews of this phone
##I had my old cell phone (Nokia) for years and it worked great
##I've had this one less than six months and have had nothing but problems
[t] over rated phone
##I purchased this phone about 5 months ago
##This phone has a lot of problems, some times it difficult to make phone calls it keeps telling me "call failed" I thought that the network is busy but when I put the SIM card in my old Samsung phone there was no problem at all
service[@]##The other problem is static, people can not hear me clearly because of static, and however I have full service 4 to 5 bars
software[@]##The software is very slow when you scroll between menus
screen[@]##After I disconnect the phone from the charger the screen start to blink and the resolution goes down
##I called Cingular and they replaced with another refurbished phone that have the same problems
##Finally they are going to send me a new phone hopefully this will work
##I owned so many phones with different brands and the best are Nokia and Samsung
[t] great but expensive phone
##Pros
[t] Not as good as it looks
##This phone is too thin and too wide when flipped open, it is not comfortable when I hold it in my hand and try to dial a number
##Just picture yourself holding a half deck of poker and try to use your thumb to press on the surface of the card
design[@][u]##The unbalance weight between the top portion and the bottom portion as you flip the phone open is another  flaw; I always feel awkward when try to press the number keys due to the uneven weight between the VGA and the keypad
##The speaker level for incoming call is also very low
##Even though I had the volume level set to the highest, it is only loud enough to hear the person's voice in a very quite room
##I think that I will have a problem when outside a noise area
##My only regret is that I should have walked to a store and look at it in person before buy it online
[t] Nothing special, not that bad, just OK.
##This cell phone is a good phone for folks interested in 1)showing it off, 2) downloading Top 10 tunes as ring tones, 3) taking photos to send to friends, 4) showing it off
##My husband I and both bought the phones when changing to Cingular, figuring that they might have some good features we could use
##We have had no trouble with them so far
price[@]##However, if you need substance over style, you can probably do better for the price
##We had some nice little LG phones when we were with Verizon which worked very well and were easier to use in the organizational functions than the RAZR
##If you need a phone that you can use easily for work, don't purchase the RAZR
##If you need a phone to show off, go for it
[t] Sleek
##I love this phone because of its dimensions
##It is so thin that you can just slide it into your pocket without any problems
battery[@]##Also, the battery last for a very long so you do not have to charge the phone every couple of days
camera[@]##The programs in conjuction with the camera makes this phone amazing
##I would buy this phone again if for any reason I were to lose the one I have
##It is so user friendly
camera[@]##The camera is very good
##You can use it if you are cheap and want to have another background on the phone and do not want to pay for one
screen[@]##Take a picture off your computer screen
##The different ring tones on this phone are awesome
##It can store many phone numbers and has a lot of memory to store pictures
##This is the best phone on the market right now
[t] CINGULAR & ATT RIP OFF AND DRIVE YOU NUTS
##Do not deal with Cingular and or ATT because these companies will drive you crazy
##I learned this a hard way, in the last 3-4 months I have been double charged every month because the Cingular and AT&T made a mistake on my account
##To explain this further I had a 2 year contract for my wireless telephone with AT&T
service[@]##Within a few month AT&T sold their wireless service to Cingular and after that I was paying to Cingular for the account
##I decided I wanted a new wireless telephone device about August of 2005, I was told if I wanted a new telephone I had to open an account with Cingular, so I did and that is when the whole problem started because now I was being billed double by both companies, Cingular and AT&T
##I also received a phone which I did not like and sent it back for which I was not credited for
##I am 52 year old man and I never had so much problem with any company in my life as I have had with Cingular and AT&T
service[@]##The customer service is a nightmare and for the last three or four months I have been constantly on telephone arguing about my incorrect bill and the credit due for retuned wireless phone with no success, every time I was bounced around and every time the telephone call lasted three to four hours with no result in sight
service[@]##The customer service at both companies are robotic and custome service can care less about solving problem
##Stay away from the nightmare called Cingular Wireless and AT&T if you care about your sanity
##I have learned that I am not the only one who had this problem, other people had to go thru the same horrible experience as I did
service[@]##It seems like these companies found a way to rip people off thru wireless phone service
[t] Cingulair users
##Although I don't have the RAZR V3 yet, I got rid of myEriccson Z500a phone
##But, the problem is not the phone
##It's Cingular
##No matter what, they all have the sameproblem
##Your phone will cut off in the middle of your conversation
##You can hardly hear the other party
##As your about to answer the phone, it cuts off with the first ring
##And a bunch of other technical problems similar to other Cingular users
##My advise is Stay away from Cingular
service[@]##Sprint is soso technically and has an awful customer service
service[@]##I used to have T-mobile, the phones never gave me a problembecause their phone service and coverage is great
##Anywhere in the world; therefore, I am going back to T-mobile and I'm sure that the RAZR V3 will not have any coverage/tech problems
[t] I Am Glad I Bought This Phone
##i bought this kinda like an experiment, not knowing what to expect
##im glad i bought it
price[@]##it's the best phone i've ever used, and i actually think the high price was worth it in the end
##i mean common the peoples pictures are in the phonebook, not their name , but their picture
##well worth it
[t] LOoks cool
##I dont ave this phone yet but from what I understsnd here are some pros and cons
[t] 24 hours or 10 days?
##I never received my order because what was most ship in 24 hours became estimated ten days
##I terminated my order
[t] V3 Razer - the missing link
##If this machine comes with a SD memory slot, i think this a best buy in town
[t] I Glad I Have It
##i got this on amazon pretty cheap, and im glad i got it
##im a nokia kinda guy but this is well worth it
[t] Anyone have success in porting # after buying from Amazon
##I want to buy the RAZR and keep my current number on Sprint
##It seems Amazon says the rebates would be invalid
##Anyone have experience with this?
[t] Your location may call for TMobile
##Even though Cingular offers this deal in other parts of my local coverage area, the offer does not apply to my zip
##TMobile does offer an equivalent of this deal in my area
##Ergo
[t] Well worth it
##I have received nothing but stares of jealousy that are well warranted
[t] Great material, good design, compromised function for size
##First things first
price[@]##I got the Motorola RAZR V3 from a Cingular Company store when the price dropped to USD299
##99 - retail price, no contract required
##As opposed to USD199
##99 for a two year contract or FREE if you get a contract from Amazon
price[@]##Don't buy from Cingular franchise/independent dealers because they don't make money from selling the phones alone so they mark up the retail price above what Cingular company stores sell them
service[@]##I use the phone for my T-Mobile service
##I legally unlocked the phone via Cingular
##No firmware updates, web site unlocking or hacking required
##The only downside is that there is Cingular branding everywhere
price[@][u]##But for the cheap  to pay for the phone, it's not a problem at all
##All I did was have T-Mobile send me their settings over the air (OTA)
##The Phone
design[@][u]##* Design - Kudos to Motorola for finally coming out with a great  for a clamshell phone
##It's unbelievably thin, light and functional
##All thanks to the aluminum material
##Of course they weren't the first company to make full use of it
##Nokia made the first daring route of using metal alloys by introducing their 8800 series more than 6 years ago
##Apple followed and introduced 1-inch laptops starting with the titanium PowerBook and, of course, the aluminum revisions
design[@]##With the clamshell closed or open, it looks like one killer design
##I like the way they incoporated side keys for a supposed one-handed operation, but in reality the keys are not easily accessible when flipped open
##But still a good thoughtful addition
design[@][u]##The keypad is another cool 
##Laser precision cut - one piece from an alloy material
price[@]##I agree there isn't much tactile feedback, but that's the price to pay for a thin phone
##There is still tactile feedback, mind you, and it's enough to let me know I pressed the key
##However, the keys are so flat that it's hard to distinguish from one key to the next except for the slight separation from the translucent rubber material (where the blue light emits) in between keys
screen[@]##* Screen - Finally they introduce a main 262K color screen and a 2nd display with 4,096 color screen
##This beats the standard 65K for other phones
##Despite the feat, sadly both screens easily gets washed out in bright sunlight
screen[@][u]##Motorola should equip the  with anti-glare glass and contrast enhancing s to aid the viewing
screen[@][u]##To save on battery, you can adjust the brightness, turn on the saver or completely shut the  when not in use for a time
##* Making a call - This is where the V3 shines
##So far no dropped calls, static noises or whatever
##Signal strength is very decent
##I could hear the callers and they could hear me very well
size[@]##The speakerphone is mighty loud for a phone this size
##It is very useable and convenient
##* Menu - I jump from phone to phone and found Nokia to make the best, most intuitive menu
##IMHO you don't need to read the manual in a Nokia phone because you will find the settings in places you expect them to be
##My last GSM Motorola phone was a Startac series and I swore never to come back to Motorola until now
##Frankly the V-series designs suck
##But the RAZR made people like me notice Motorola once again
##The menu for the RAZR is finally very good
##Not great
##It's still not as functional as I would expect, but it's getting there
##You would still have to crawl your way around especially if you want to find settings for MMS and WAP
##* Functionality - For a phone this thin and good-looking, it's surprisingly very functional
camera[@]##Although I am disappointed by the miniscule VGA camera specs and lack of EDGE feature
##My two year old Nokia 6230 and Nokia 6600 came equipped with those features
##This is less than a year old phone
##What gives?* Bluetooth - Works 99% of the time with the top of the line Motorola HS850
##The calls transfer flawlessly to the headset
##But there were instances when I couldn't make it transfer quickly or at all
##Rare, but still happens
##Btw, get the black HS850 European version
##The US version with a blue color is just too preppy and tacky
##To each his own
##* Fit and Finish - In my job, I've seen so many other people with RAZR phones that I've examined how it goes thru the daily wear and tear
##One phone bent at the top
##Unlike a plastic phone that can scratch or crack, the metal furthermore bends
##If you drop it
battery[@]##Because of the material and design, the only user replaceable part is the battery cover
##Yipee
screen[@]##I've seen two phones with a flickering screen
##Also another phone with the back cover discolored from tossing it around the table-tops
##If you're the careful type or you can simply afford to toss them after the season, it's really not for the faint of heart
##There is evidence of poor construction
battery[@]##The battery cover does not fit properly on some phones
##On some phones they fit great
##On others you will have to make it snap
##* Phonebook - I have to tackle this separately because most people think that you CANNOT have multiple numbers under one name
##That simply isn't true
##They are the type who don't care to read the manual it came with
##On their defense like I said the menu system is bad that a simple feature as adding numerous numbers under one name is not evident
##There are two steps you MUST do in order to refrain from the phone from displaying the same names multiple times in the address book
##Step 1
[t] Lovely phone - get what you pay for... !
service[@]##Right off I have to say that when it comes to cell service and phones and the inherent contracts
[t] Decent
##There's quite a few things I like about this phone, and a few things I dislike
##We'll start with the likes
[t] Read the fine print
service[@]##Be very wary of Amazon's new promotion for a the $50 Razor with new Cingular service
##If you read the fine print you'll find that porting your number to a Cingular account "makes you ineligible for the Amazon
##com rebates
##" Other than that the phone is decent, it looks cool (thin but wide) and is a good deal for $50 if you don't need to port an old number
[t] Great looking phone....if yer into that sort of thing
##I'll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated
##1) The Phonebook application is a little
##wonky
##Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true
##You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the "MORE" function while editing the contact
##However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app
##which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle
##1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts
##I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory
##No dice
##The scroll speed is untenable
##Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker
##What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list
##2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough
##Plus, the "audio sweet spot" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear
##If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone
##3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception
##The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house
##The RAZR gets 2
##This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help
##Their advice? "Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower
##"4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet
##Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor
##I know - you don't buy a phone for its games
##But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is
##the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled
##After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it
##Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says "Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet"
##My wife's V330 has a similar issue
##She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone
##Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV
##5) Camera phone still only 640x480
##Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part6) Phone response is fairly poor as well
##Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)
##so very slow
button[@][u]##You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the  again, at which point it responds to TWO  presses and you have to start all over again
##7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis
##I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work
##Alright, so now for the good
##1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece
##Oohs and ahhs all around
##if you care about that sort of thing
##I usually don't
battery[@]##I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz)
##But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades
battery[@]##2) Great battery power
##I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left
##3) This is a sturdy phone
##My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all
##Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece
##I've not had any issues
##The phone is rock solid
ringtones[@][u]##4) The usual amount of  and wallpapers
##all of which are amazingly expensive
software[@],ringtones[@][u]##Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar?5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN 
software[@][u]##I haven't played around with the  yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree
##6) Excellent Bluetooth performance
##Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great
##Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated
sound[@]##Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space
sound[@][u]##7) Did I mention this phone is attractve?8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone  quality
##I wish the speaker was this loud
##This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume
##Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow
design[@]##But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it
##Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times
[t] Big improvements; minor problems
##Problems
[t] Image...but little substance / avoid Cingular!
##First the phone
[t] I love this phone
##I've heard about this phone long before it ever reached US soil, and wanted it very bad based on looks alone
##Took me awhile to get it but it was worth the wait
##This IS a great phone
##Let's touch base on appearance first
##Obviously, it is gorgeous
##Not all of the casing is metal, but the plastic parts are made to blend seemlessly in
##It shines brightly and attracts people to it like a moth to light
##I've noticed people catching glimpses of it from what seemed like a mile away! Get used to people wanting to hold and use your phone
##It's thin, and wide, but do not find it's wideness a problem
##I'm a female and have tiny hands and it fits fine to me
screen[@]##Being that the keys are flat, you have to look at the keypad while dialing anyway, so what's the point of complaining that you can't dial with the hand you're holding it in? The black around the external screen is a nice touch to the silver
screen[@]##The external screen itself only serves it's purpose
##It's tiny, and the colours are not wonderful but it always shows the time for you and useful for caller/picture ID
camera[@]##Can also be used as an external viewfinder for the camera
##Back/battery cover was no problem getting on like some people have said
##They must of had bad models
##Snapped on right away
##Looks of this phone are flawless and deserve a five star rating on their own
screen[@]##Internal screen
##what more can you say then WOW! First time I seen it, I about had a heart attack
screen[@]##The colours are so VIVID and stand out from the screen
##It almost looks three dimensional
##I'm not the only one who gave that reaction
##EVERY single person that opened that phone jumped in amazement
##Keypad is the second most attractive feature on this phone (after the internal screen)
##The thin, gleeming metal mezmerises you
##While it might look fantastic, don't be fooled because it works just as good
##Very easy to press the keys, almost effortlessly
##Everything is in the right place, it lights up nice and bright, everything is big enough so you do not have any problems hitting the wrong keys
##I like the added message key that takes me straight to my messages
button[@]##As well as the web button that takes you directly to the browser
##Great additions
##Another thing I like, is how the keypad gently vibrates during certain operations instead of making noises
##Without hearing those annoying tones, you still know that you are pressing the keys
##Sound quality is A+ as I always expect from Motorola
##Never once has a call not been loud and clear
##Speakerphone is just as good, I can hear it from other rooms
##The ringer modes work great, vibration mode will not fault you
##I've had problems with other phones vibrating so softly
##you couldn't tell you were getting a call
##This one will vibrate like crazy! You can customize your ringer options to what you please
##Reception has been 100% perfect so far
##No dropped calls, nothing unclear or scrambled
service[@]##I use Cingular service in the Las Vegas area and the calls are crystal clear like I should expect
##Better then most internal antennae phones I've used!Menus are a bit complicated for a first time user of phones or the Motorola firmware
##I've had Motorola phones previously (the v400 being the most recent) so I already knew how to get around this phone
software[@]##The software is a lot like the v400s with a few added features
##The phone book is a little confusing but I've never had problems with it
##Read the manual if you get lost, it's no big deal like some people have made it out to be
##Every feature is placed under the right categories
##Everything is very customizable
##Three skin options are available and they are all very nice and really make the menus and gui stand out
##Included wallpapers are great
##I usually hate included wallpapers and immediately buy my own
##haven't so far on this phone
screen[@]##There are not many but they all are great shots or animations and look so beautiful on the screen
ringtones[@]##Included ringtones aren't bad, either
ringtones[@][u]##I prefer mp3  so have bought my own, but if you like using standard tones
##you'll find one to your liking on here
##Many to choose from
##Camera quality is what you would expect from a cell phone
##People complaining about quality need to realize they are shooting pictures from a phone
camera[@]##not a real camera
##Every shot I've taken has looked great in all lighting conditions
##Easy to take and send photos
##Camera does not take video but can view video
service[@]##A feature I will more then likely not use unless I wanted to purchase Cingular's news or sports service that stream videos online to your phone
##There are no games included
##I never play games on cell phones so it's no biggy to me
##If you can afford a cell phone like this, then you're probably too old to play the hard-to-make-out games on phones anyway
##Most of the decent games to play are never included on phones anyway
##Battery life is decent, depending on usage as usual
##I can usually go about three days without charging with normal daily use
##If you are on this phone, making calls and playing around all day long
##you will be charging it every night
##All in all, this is an amazing phone
price[@]##You can't go wrong getting it, especially when the price is getting lower
##I was debating on getting this phone or a smartphone and I'm glad with the decision I made
##If you want all the useful (and actually needed) features of a cell phone
##with the looks to kill then get this phone
##It'll make you happy
[t] Great Phone, Awful Price
##The Razr V3 is definately one of the better phones I've had
##For starters the manual isnt great at giving you some of the details
##The phone in general has great looks, obviously very slim and fits into any pocket perfectly
##I wouldnt recommend it if you have big fingers though because you might find a hard time trying to punch the numbers in
camera[@]##Im not a huge camera phone fanatic so I never really cared much about the quality
battery[@]##The reception is excellent, battery life is amazing, and if you like buttons and gadgets, this phone has plenty of them
##Quad band does allow you to take this phone pretty much anywhere in the world
##All you need to do is rent a sim card or something overseas
##All in all its user friendly except like I mentioned earlier the manual could of been more percicive about a few things I ran into
price[@]##Unless your job doesnt need any flashy objects that attract clients to you by making you look rich, I wouldnt recommend buying this phone at its original price
##Its a great phone, but thats just asking too much for it
##(
##)Pros
[t] Overpriced, Basic Feature Set, Imperfect Design - RAZR V3
##The Motorola RAZR V3 is a "pretty" phone; this is especially the case when viewed in photographs (like what you'll see here on Amazon
##com)
##DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE BEFORE SEEING IT FIRST HAND
##Though even that did not stop me from making the impulsive purchase online, seeing it "live" did present me with my first, second-thoughts

[t] Exceeded my expectations
##It seems clear to me that many of my fellow reviewers of this product were short-changed
##I, contrastingly, love this cell phone
##It would appear that the fault does not lie with the phone itself, rather with Cingular
##I'll cut right to the chase
##This phone is sleek, attractive, sexy, the ultimate cell phone
size[@]##At 33, I have been waiting for this phone since back in the day when Motorola's phones were the size of one's head
screen[@]##The screen is hot
sound[@]##The sound is crystal clear
##Ring tones are easily downloaded
##Pictures are what you would expect from a gadget whose prime directive is not as a digital cam, rather as a cell phone
##Secondary functions remain just that, secondary
##Despite this fact, the picture quality is clear, and pictures are easily downloaded to your pc
##Think of the V3 as the Delorean of cell phones
##My opinion has always been, regarding cell phones, that if it doesn't fit in my pocket (without bulk), I don't want it
##At 5'6", and 30" waist, I can easily slide this phone into any one of my Levi's pockets
##Unfortunately, many preceding reviewers got jipped
##I bought the V3 overseas, and even the packaging was impressive
##It came in a gorgeous metallic box, matching the V3's exterior shell, and it included the following accessories (no joke)
[t] Pocket Friendly....
##I have had my phone now for about a year now
##If that doesn't qualify me to write this article then I don't know what does
##The biggest reason I got this phone is because unlike many people, I don't clip my phone on my belt, I put it in my pocket
##For years I was troubled with the antenna sticking me in the side of the leg
##Buttons would always be pressed whenever I moved a specific way
##This phone has relatively none of those problems
##Sure there are buttons on the side, but you have to press them more firmly then you do on most phones, which prevents any of them being pressed while in your pocket
size[@][u]##Another thing is the  of the phone
##I like the phone because of its thinness and its ability to just slide into my pocket
##Some people don't like it because it is too wide, but for those of us who have big hands this thing is great
##Which leads me into my next point, the buttons on the inside, they are not necessarily big but bigger than you find on most phones
##There have been many times where my fingers would hit two buttons, because like most people, I use my thumb to dial
##And if you are worried about the buttons not having that "button feel" the buttons actually press down and feel like regular buttons
battery[@]##I have seen some complaints about the battery life for the phone
##Personally, I use my phone for about a half-hour each day on average
##I can go 3-4 days without having to charge it
battery[@]##Now, if you are using the thing non-stop all day long you are going to lose battery life pretty quick, but this is often the case with many phones on the market
screen[@]##The biggest thing that I don't like is that the screen on the front scratches easy
##But if you keep it in the case it usually prevents any scratching
##Honestly though, there really isnt much to complain about with this phone
##I have enjoyed it for over a year now and am still enjoying it
##This really is a great product from Motorola
[t] More durable than you think!
##I bought this phone in May of 2005
##I'll admit, it was mostly for the trend factor
##Standing in the store holding it, I was pretty sure I would break it
##I had six years of cell phone experience behind me with barely a scratch (well, except that one time it fell out of my pocket), and I was suddenly afraid that in three days, I would be able to overturn everything that Motorola engineers had worked for
##Eight months later, I still don't have a single scratch on it
##I am notorious for putting it in a sweatshirt pocket when I'm wearing pants without pockets, then when I get out of the car and it falls straight out onto the concrete, skids for a few feet under my car, and then my fumbling rubs it a little more over the rocky surface
##It's been opened and closed way too many times, thrown onto couches (and inevitably bouncing back onto the hardwood floor), and the run-ins with concrete are more than I care to count
##Despite the fact that the past eight months has made me significantly more clumsy, my phone still looks like the day I bought it
##I am also the type of person who doesn't think about my phone once it leaves my pocket
##This results in a lot of days in a row without charging
##I tend to go between 3-4 days without charging it
##I use it regularly during the day, sometimes resulting in 30+ minute phone calls here and there
battery[@]##Unlike past phones I've had, 2 out of 3 bars doesn't necessarily mean you have 10 minutes of battery life left
battery[@][u]##It is, by far, the best  I've ever had on a phone
##After eight months it still works exactly the way it did when I bought it
##My biggest complaint is the volume
##I find myself pressing it pretty hard into my ear to hear the person at the other end
##I've always had small issues with cell phone volume, but once I put it as high as it will go, I (and everyone else around me, unfortunately) can hear just fine
##Cranking up the volume on this one still hasn't done too much for me
##Without this issue, I'd be more than happy to give it 5 stars
camera[@]##If you're more interested in a portable camera with phone capabilities, I suggest getting a cheap phone and a more expensive digital camera
##It has the image quality that I expect from a phone - but I suspect I'm in the minority of camera-phone users nowadays
##When you're outdoors in good lighting, or potentially indoors where it's really bright, you can get recognizable photos at 640x480
size[@][u]##And don't let the zoom feature fool you - as you zoom, it decreases the  of the image
##So your 160x120 image you get at the 4x zoom really is just a 25% crop of the non-zoomed photo
camera[@]##I'm a photographer, so I usually have a camera with me - but there have been a couple of occasions (such as shopping) when I need someone to see an image right away, so I can click one off, send it to a friend, and get instant gratification
##So much faster than taking a photo, going home, emailing it, and having to travel all the way back to the store!While there are lots of bells and whistles on it that I anticipated myself using, I really only use it as it's original purpose - a phone
##I make calls, I check voicemail, I rarely use it as a camera, and I now use it in place of my alarm clock
##It functions well in all of these settings
##In retrospect, I might have saved a little money and bought a different phone
##If you just need something to make phone calls, chances are you can find a free (or very cheap) phone that will do the job
##The best thing about the shape for me is that I can slip it in a jeans pocket and not look extra bulky
##It's slim enough that I still feel relatively comfortable with it in my pocket when I sit down
##It's very light
##Sometimes when I have it in a jacket pocket, I even panic a little because I don't feel the weight and I'm afraid I don't have it
##It's wider than most cell phones - I haven't compared it, but I imagine the full volume of it is more than some of the smaller phones out there
##I like the large screen, though
##It's easy to see and read, and when I hold it in one hand and dial, it feels comfortable
##Even with my small hands, it fits great and I never have any issues
##It's easy to flip open with one hand as well
##If it wasn't for my personal volume issues, I would give this phone five stars
##It's lasted me well, and let's face it, it still looks cool
##There are other great phones out there, but I definitely think this one is still a major competitor after over a year of being on the market
[t] RAZR Fan
##Wow
price[@]##Since the price dropped I ran out and bought this phone
##Most important to me were the following in this order
design[@],battery[@]##Speakerphone, battery life, bluetooth and design
##The RAZR doesn't dissapoint in those areas
##The speakerphone is one of the better ones that I've ever used
##I've been in separate rooms and didn't have a problem communicating in either direction
battery[@]##The battery life will last me approximately three days without charging
##I only talk about 30 minutes a day on my phone
##The benefits of BT goes without saying
design[@]##The design of the phone to say the least is phenomenal
##If you're the type that want's to turn heads, then get this phone just for that fact
##I've read some reviews saying the phone is too wide
##For me, since I have small-to-medium sized hands it fits very comfortable
##The display is phenomenal
##Now to my dislikes
##I feel these are minor and shouldn't be a deterant
##1) The buttons will take a bit of getting used too
##2)The outer display would have been better if it used the same amount of colors as the internal display
##3) The address book is a bit too cumbersome
##4)Web navigation is absolutely slow
service[@]##I don't know if it's the service or the OS
##Since I use my cell as my home phone it was important to me to have a high quality phone with as many features as possible
design[@][u]##If all the cell phone manufactures would take a cue from Motorola on the  and feature set of this phone we would all be in cell phone nirvana
[t] It Smells - literally
##I've had the Razr for about 9 months - it has been a great phone (although I think the nokia interface is better than moto)
##I would definitely recommend it although it seems it needs no recommendation, everyone and their mother now has this phone
##My only complaint is that the phone, specifically the keypad, recently started to smell
##It's not a cleanliness thing as my wife's Razr also recently started to smell weird, definitely something to do with the components or adhesives
##The smell is pretty acrid and actually makes it hard to use the phone
##A quick online search reveals that a lot of other people are starting to have this problem after owning the phone for about 6 months
##No solutions or responses form motorola on the topic however so beware
[t] The word PHONE is back in Cell Phone.
##Choosing the V3 was a matter of just going through all the phones on the market to find the one that stands out the most
##First of all the start of the year 2006 has seen a big change in mobile phone development
##Many companies, such as Siemens, have now abandoned the cell phone market
##Motorola have scaled back on the number of models they have released in the past 12 months
##The selection is much smaller than the start of the 21st century
##Apart from the lesser range we have a new type of phone
##First of all photo cameras are now almost a standard inclusion unless you aim at the cheapie range of devices
screen[@]##A color screen is the major bonus on all high-end phones
##The V3 has one of the best ones
battery[@]##These new phones are lighter and have a longer battery life
##Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) means roaming anywhere in the world is now possible
##Talking and listening are hyper clear as if the person is standing next to you
##New functions make most of the high-end range of phones practically little PCs or a Palm
size[@]##The shape and size of the V3 lean it in the direction of a Palm
##The V3 comes with a leather case
##It is a very nice case that uses a magnetic clasp
##By flipping open the lid you can easily read the time on the front color display
##The leather case has an input hole on the side for recharging
##There is a hole in the case for a speaker
##It has back clip that can be used for fastening on your belt
##The V3 is lighter than an iPod mini
screen[@]##The front panel has a screen that can be used for seeing a small display of the time or can be used for taking front pictures
##There are three buttons for changing the ring tone presets, dialing names and taking pictures when the flip top is closed
##When open these buttons perform new functions
camera[@],size[@][u]##The camera is a tiny pinhole  red lens
camera[@],size[@][u]##This VGA camera has x 4 zoom and takes photographs of up to 640 x 420 in 
##To be honest if anyone believes that phone cams are anywhere near as good as even low-end digital cameras then they are only going to be disappointed
camera[@][u]##The phone  is great for sending pictures to one another using the MMS system but for the photo album they can look low in resolution, sometimes blurry and even badly lit with streaks running down them
##Now and again you can pull off a good shot worthy of your home album collection but don't expect miracles here
screen[@]##For MMS the quality is great and the V3 phone has a big enough display screen to showoff MMS for all its worth, so lets flip open the phone to see what's under the hood
screen[@]##You don't know which catches the eye more when you do flip the phone open, the screen or the keypad that lights up neon blue and looks like it has been ripped clean out of a control panel onboard one of the UFOs that crashed in Roswell
##There is no other phone out there that looks as cool as this one does, either closed or open
screen[@],size[@]##The wide screen size is just less than 1
##75 inches which makes this one of widest phones on the market; a step maybe back to the world of bulky brick phones in girth but the extra girth certainly does not have the weight or thickness
size[@]##In fact, this is the thinnest phone on the market today and feels as good as a full size phone at a fraction of the weight and looks truly imaginative and good-looking up against the side of the head
##In fact it feels like a phone where the flat phones create a more ambiguous feel
##The phone is back in cell phone! The phone functions as everything from a dictaphone to a speakerphone
##You answer calls by flipping the lid or pressing a key when open to answer a call, you choose
##Voice recognition, call waiting, you name it, you got it here
##Backlit menu systems, clocks, graphical text message indicators, voice mail buttons, voice mail indication, volume select/display, signal strength indication, call timers, redialing, missed call indicators, call logs, voice activated dialing, any-key answering, auto-answering, speed dialing, mute, vibration
##The phone book capacity has up to 100 entries
##The phone can act as a Modem
##Minimum standby time is 250 hours and minimum talk time is 360 minutes with a 2 hour charge time makes it hard to beat
##You get a free headphone and jack in the box
##However the real gem of the lot is in the wireless Bluetooth feature
##Get yourself a Bluetooth USB adaptor (costs extra) and set it up on your PC
##Install Phonetools (CD is in the box) and forget about using the phone USB cable
##Now activate Bluetooth in the V3 and activate a Bluetooth Phonetools connection
##Now you can wirelessly control your mobile phone
##Your mobile phone can be in the bedroom and you can be answering calls on your PC in the study, send SMS
##do whatever you want remotely
##You can write memos, use the phone tools, dump images, sounds and set your calendar
##Wireless Bluetooth to your PC is truly amazing, amazing, amazing
##If you want you can buy a Bluetooth headset, however why would you want to hide the V3? Bring it out and flip it open! If this is the first flip phone you own you will probably be aware in the first few seconds of holding it that this is not something you can afford to drop
##The V3 will most likely smash and break
##It is just not as sturdy as a flat phone
##So you will be pressed to take more care with it
##Your lifestyle will play a big part in whether or nor this phone can survive with you
##If there is one negative, it is that when the phone is closed you may accidentally press the ring tone preset to silent
##It is possible to do if you don't keep the V3 in its case
##The case prevents that from happening
##There is also a low level hum that can he heard if you hold the keypad up to your ear, especially in a silent environment - you can't hear it when your ear is against the speaker or in public places
##You can also hear it if closed and if you put your ear against it
##So it is not technically a silent phone, but if you think placing it next to you in bed at night is going to keep you awake, you are wrong
##Although an extremely light hum can be heard when making calls, there is still no other product that sounds as clear as this phone does
##It is really just cribbing about something that doesn't affect this marvelous phone in any way
##Overall you won't be disappointed with the V3
##It is awesome
##Pros
[t] RAZR V3 REview
##While the form factor is excellent, the quality is very poor
service[@]##I am on my 4th one since buying the phone and service package in Feb
##'05
screen[@]##First, the screen went deadSecond, the keypad went inoperativeThird, it would not power up at allFourth (the current one) the screen has sharp lines across it
##Can go away with a hard reset, but it's a nuisance
service[@]##While the service provider has willingly replaced each one promptly, I would not buy this phone again
price[@]##The fact that the price has droped form $500 to free in 6 months further supports my positon
service[@]##I asked the service provider to replace this phone with another model, but they refused
##They expressed willingness to replace it like-for-like as often as needed, while it's still under warranty
##Amazing
##I wonder who absorbs the cost of warranty on this unit
service[@]##The manufacturer, or the service provider?
[t] Excellent Phone
##I'm up in the North East and Cingular is great up here
##I have had them for several years now and have tried other cell phone providers, but they are the best I think
##This phone is great
##I have had it for six months now and it works great
##Reception is great, I get a signal in areas where other phones I have had I couldn't
##I have dropped it several times and still not a scratch due to the metal housing
screen[@]##Great screen
##Bluetooth works well
##Phone is very loud
battery[@]##The battery life is great
##I have read where some people say it is horrible
battery[@]##I'm on the phone all the time and I have never used up the battery to go under two bars
##Great phone
##The one drawback I found was Cingular will not insure the phone
[t] COOOL phone !
##This is a great phone with everything I wanted esp
##bluetooth,camera and most important STYLE ;)However I noticed one problem on the phone
##Bluetooth does not work at times, the phone gives an error message saying "Bluetooth not enabled"
##It occured twice in last 2 weeks but I could not reproduce it, seems to be random error
##I had to reboot the phone and then it started working just fine
##Not sure if its only my phone as I think nobody else had this problem
ringtones[@][u]##Overall I love this phone, its loud and clear with easy to use user interface and again it looks COOOOOL!About Cingular, it does not offer anything free! There was not a single game on the phone and no cool  or backgrounds
##Most of the services like text messaging are priced at nearly double the rate of tmobile
##Thats something to consider before moving to Cingular!
[t] Great Phone, great deals available
##This is really a nice phone, but is available in the USA for cingular only
service[@]##However if you have a retailer who can unlock the phone, you can use it with any gsm service
##I got an unlocked phone for free after rebate and had wireless BT included for free
##Today, there is good deal at buy
##com, better than amazon
##The same phone for free after rebate and a free Blue tooth handsfree kit
##Tapas, NJ, USA
[t] cool looking, but fails in functionality
##I've had this phone for 6 months now
##Here are the gist of its pros and cons
##Pros
[t] Beautiful, but beware of the dust
##The razr is the first cell phone I've ever had, so I can't compare its use to other cell phones, but know that it's every bit as beautiful as the pictures show
screen[@][u],camera[@]##The generously-sized  is also nice, and the camera and photo are decent
##Of course, the most attractive thing about this phone is how thin it is
##Not only does it look sleek, but it slides into my pocket VERY easily, so I'm not bothered with a huge lump in my pocket or a phone holster
##This phone has more capabilities than I care to mess with, but know that a lot of them require dishing out a little more moola (it only comes with one game, and it's a demo)
screen[@]##My main disappointment with this phone is that dust seems to very easily find its way up under the screen
screen[@]##This is very easy to fix - all you have to do is slide a pin under the upper corner under the screen protector and down the side
screen[@]##There's some kind of sticky glue holding it down, and the screen protector comes off with a bit work, and sticks back on very easily
screen[@]##Once you have it pried off, just wipe the dust off the underside with a lint-free cloth, and then stick the screen protector back on
##Good as new
screen[@]##If you damage the screen protector, I hear that they can be purchased for about $4
##00
[t] Overall a very nice phone
service[@]##I've read many a review on the Razr before purchasing one through Amazon with service through Cingular
##I've had the phone for a week now and find it very easy to use
##Coming from a Motorola V60P, the phone is a joy to carry around
##I've seen many negitive comments about the phone book, while it is not the best, it certainly isn't hard to use
button[@][u]##Two pushes of a  and I'm in my phone book
##I also do a lot of text messaging and have no problem with the keypad
##As mentioned, the ear piece volume is fairly low, even on it's highest setting, but the speaker phone quailty is excellent
screen[@][u]##The  is difficult to see in bright sunlight
##The phone is sturdy and built well
##I have not dropped a call on it yet
##I would have no problem recommending this phone to others
[t] Just hope your phone never quits working
battery[@]##I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off
##The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem
service[@]##After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable "due to customer abuse
##" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as "customer abuse"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation
##It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty
##You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works
##After that, you're on your own
[t] Thin, lightweight, and cute
##I bought this phone earlier last year when it first came out
##I have had it for almost an year now and I like it so far
##I havn't had any problems with it at all
##The phone itself is somewhat small (not the smallest phone out there) and thin
##The programs included in the phone are adequate but not great
##The phone also has a limited memory chip
##You can only store so many files on the phone at a time
sound[@]##The sound is just okay
##Although it does play mp3 files (so you can record you own ringtone), the ringtone always comes on 1/2 a second later when the phone starts to flash
sound[@]##The sound quality is acceptable but not fantastic--Motorola E398 is far more superior
##I personally LOVE the programs that Motorola offers on their cell phones
##They are far better than Nokia
##The V3 uses mini USB to charge and to transfer files
##Mini USB cords are used by many digital cameras and I happened to have one
##So, I didn't have to buy additional accessory for the V3 phone and I could create my own background pictures and ringtone
##Just download the Mobilephone tools
##I had it with my other E398 phone so it worked perfectly
##All in all, the phone is good but definitely not worth paying the full suggested retail prices
price[@][u]##I only paid half the  though, so it is acceptable to me
##I also have a comment about the 17 y
##o
##who also reviewed this phone
##Your dropped call problem does NOT originate from the motorola phone itself
##It's because of Cingular
##I had them before and would NEVER get them again
##My suggestion is to get an unlocked V3 and go with T-mobile =)
[t] great hardware; horrible user interface
##The hardware is great
##Small phone, excellent reception, large display
##The user interface is really quite poor
##All my previous phones have been Nokias (8290,6590i,6100), and it's shocking how much worse the Motorola UI is
##Nokia gets all the little details right, Motorola gets them all wrong
##(e
##g
##, address book entries can't have addresses in them!
##)
[t] Nothing extraordinary, mainly a lot of hype around the looks
##The phone is ok
##I didn't find any difference between RAZR and the Motorolla V300 I had earlier
##All the features are the same
##Razr has a big huge color screen, bluetooth enabled and can capture videos
##But there is no improvement on any of the calling features
##So if you are getting the phone free after the rebates you can buy it, else it is not worth the $200
[t] Motorolla Razr V3
##It seems like when anything becomes popular, people begin to put it down, but the Motorola Razr V3 isn't all hype and style
##It lives up to its hype and is a high end fully functional phone that just so happens to look absolutely gorgeous
##The Razr comes in two colors, black and silver, both made with anodized aluminum making the Razr very durable and has gives a nice solid feel
##If you've owned an Ipod Mini with the same anodized aluminum, you'll know how it feels
##It has high end features - camera, full color display, bluetooth technology, video/picture capabilites, internet, text messaging, instant messaging, speakerphone, voice capabilities, video capture, streaming and more - but it is all packed into the most thinnest phone out in the market
##Although it is quite wide for a flip phone, turn the Razr on its side and it all makes sense
screen[@],size[@][u]##Being wide, Motorola took the advantage of the space to put in a large  LCD screen that gives you crisp and bright color and clarity
screen[@]##This screen is quite large on a flip phone, but absolutely gorgeous
screen[@]##There is also an stamp sized full color external LCD screen that displays signal strengh, time, and acts as a picture caller ID
##It doesn't display date however
##I don't know why they omitted this
##The external LCD can also serve as a viewfinder when you want to take a self portrait instead of having to look into silver dot like other phones
camera[@]##The phone comes with a VGA 4x zoom camera that takes decent enough pictures, The camera feature is just an added bonus and is hardly a necessity
##Flipping up the Razr, you can see why it's been tooted as the thinnest phone out there on the market
##Even when the it's closed, it's thin, but when it opened, it practically disappears when looking at its side
##It is very pocket friendly and lightweight
##You'll hardly notice it in your pocket
##The keypad is very interesting
##It's one flat surface instead of individual buttons
##This is very different from any other phone I've ever seen
##The flat smooth surface makes navigating much moore smoother and easy, but it may take some getting used to
##It is backlit with a cool blue light that makes it easy to navigate even in the darkest of nights
##The menu interface is very easy to navigate as well
button[@][u]##You'll use the two top buttom to either go back or select or you could just use the center  on the navigation wheel
##The navigation wheel itself can be reset to accomodate your needs
##Press down, up, right or left to access whatever you want - phonebook, calender, alarm clock, messages, etc
##Sound quality is good, but may be too low in noisy areas and signal strength is excellent, at least for T-mobile customers
##The speakerphone is great
##It's loud without being too static
##Battery life is good
battery[@]##Taking pictures usually takes up a lot of battery life, but I didn't have a problem here
design[@]##Overall, with its solid construction, great high end features, gorgeous design meshing form and function, and easy menu navigation and user friendly interface, the Razr comes out as a great phone for serious users and for those just looking to turn some heads
[t] Great phone!
##Pros
[t] Okay phone
##This phone is overall just a little bit above good/okay
##I cant stand the text style and its kind hard to find everything but after a while you get used to it and overall is a pretty good and it has the regular features like alarm, voice recording, camera, video and the speaker phone comes in handy sometimes ^^ it is a popular phone because it is thin but it is kinda big for the hand as it is wide
[t] Look Elsewhere
##The only advantages to this phone is that it is cute and quad-band
service[@][u]##It cuts out all the time, even when you have full 
##It cuts out for no reason
##Ive had this phone for 6 months and as each month goes by the ear speaker is getting worse and worse
##I can hardly hear anything now
##I am forced to use an earpiece or the speaker
##I love motorola phones but the v551 is sadly a disappointment
##definitely look elsewhere!
[t] Awful phone
##I first got an LG phone, that was much better than this piece of junk
##I was having major problems with service, dropped calls, weak signal, etc so Cingular told me it was the phone (not true) and had me 'upgrade' to the V551 instead
##What a mistake that was, and they wouldnt take it back
##I'm on my third now, and every one has had a charging issue as I'm sure others have stated
##It also has a mind of its own and randomly turns on and off when it feels the urge
sound[@][u]##The signal bounces around like a pogo stick at times, and the  quality and volume sucks especially with an earpiece or bluetooth
##My wife's cheapo Samsung is 100x better and has none of these issues
##The menus are difficult to navigate and the way the phone fights you and randomly pauses and crashes and shuts on and off reminds me of Windows
design[@][u]##I even told that to a Motorola er who so happens to  their phones and his lack of response only confirms my suspicion
##I will never buy another Motorola product after owning this phone
[t] Piece of Junk
##MANY problems with this phone; low to zero volume (varies by call) is the biggest problem and is well documented in these other reviews, so I won't go into much detail
##Speakerphone works OK, but the problem is that I usually I HAVE to use it, because it's the only way I can hear the other person
design[@][u]##The actual  of the phone is not bad; it's just that it's put together like junk -- it seems as if, instead of spending 30 cents on the parts, they spent 20 cents
##Insane
design[@][u]##The other problem is the  of the charger, which is prone to stop working after a few uses unless you bend it (to the left, in my case) and keep it pulled that way while it's charging
##I agree with the person who said they would never but a Motorola product OR their stock, but I would go a step further and consider selling the stock short
##Do NOT buy this phone or any phone by Motorola
[t] a deficient unit
##I bought this phone from an independent AT$T dealer as a replacement phone on July 28, 2007
##My phone was the third tested in a store
[t] Charger doesn't work and I can't hear without speaker phone
##After using this phone for about a year, the volume on it stopped working
##I can't hear people talking to me unless I put them on speakerphone or use a headset
##I took it to my Cingular store and they said that it was a common problem with this phone and the phone would have to be replaced
##I thought that was terribly convenient for them
##Also, one of our chargers (we have two of these phones) stopped working a long time ago
##My husband and I are now separated and it looks like I got stuck with the charger that doesn't work
##You used to be able to twist it a bit to get it going, but now that doesn't work either
##So it looks like I'll be getting a new phone, but it's not going to be from Cingular or Motorola since they can't build a simple phone that works with a charger that actually charges
##This isn't rocket science here
##Cell phones have been around for a while now
##You'd think the technology wouldn't be that complicated
##Basically, Cingular and Motorola want to be certain that you purchase a new phone every single year so they develop phones that automatically break down after a year of use
##Smart company
[t] Great phone.
##I've had this phone for 2 years and it has served me well
##It was my first cell phone and has proven to be very durable based on the countless times I accidentally dropped it
##All it did was bounce around
##The features are good - camera, speaker phone, video, and messaging
##I've recently upgraded from this phone and went with another brand, but this was simply because I wanted something different and nothing at all to do with this phone
##This phone is good
##And I would recommend it
[t] I still miss this phone!
##This was a really great phone for me
##until the earpiece went bad
##I had to use speaker phone all the time
##The Cingular reps just threw up their hands and pointed to my contract
##But, I had the phone for over 2 years, and it went through a beating with me, (dropped a couple times on concrete) so I forgive it
##It is very easy to use, and in case you didn't know, the functions and layout are very similar to the Razr
##If you like this layout but don't like the Razr's styling, this is an alternative
internet[@][u],camera[@]##Honestly, if the earpiece hadn't broken, I probably would have kept it even though the camera is barely average quality and the  connection is slow
design[@][u]##This  is several years old, so keep that in mind too
##If I had to make the decision over again, I still would have gotten this phone
##Besides the earpiece problem, it was very solid, dependable and well built
##Since I gave up using this phone, there have been nothing but problems with the replacements I have had, so now I miss the reliability of this one, even if it is behind the times as far as features
[t] Ear piece goes bad
##The ear piece on this phone goes bad
##I had a V400 and the ear piece went bad
##They replaced it 4 times then cingular gave me the V551 and i had to get that replace once and then the warranty ended and the ear piece failed again
##I absolutely do not recommend this phone or other motorola's
[t] Good Phone for the Price
##This is my second motorola phone; the first lasted about a year and a half, and I've had this one for about a year a 4 months
##It's very durable, and has been dropped and thrown and bounced around countless times, with no ill effect
##I do have a bodyglove case for it, which I'm sure affords some protection, but I have to give some of the credit to the phone
##As for the people who say this phone won't let them call certian numbers, or won't accept calls (tells callers that the number is unavailable/doesn't exist) - I know this was a problem that Cingular had in some areas of the country
##I called them about it several months ago (I was having the same problem) and they said they were aware of it and were working to fix it
##I haven't had that problem again since then, so I would say it's a problem with the service, not the phone
##The volume is a little low sometimes, but it's still definitely easy to hear in quiet places, and, while it's difficult to hear in noisy places, so is any other phone
camera[@]##The speakerphone and camera are great; the video is really cool because it doesn't have a time length like the video feature on many other phones, so you're not restricted to 15 seconds of video at a time
##All in all, a very good phone - I'll definitely go for another Motorola when I upgrade this phone!
[t] Works great so far...
##I'm keeping my fingers crossed because I've got another year on my contract with Cingular, but so far, after a whole year+ of use, I haven't had any problems with this phone
screen[@]##I love the bright screen and large key pad
ringtones[@]##Also, the bluetooth is fabulous - I don't have to pay to email my pictures to myself or anyone else because I can just send them straight to my computer via bluetooth! I also love the bluetooth because it allows me to create my ringtones - which once again saves me from having to pay for them
##Plus, I get the exact clip I want from any song I want, so it's a win, win situation
##The menus are fairly user friendly, and I've had no problem customizing my phone
##The downsides to the phone (and the reasons for only 4 stars) are
[t] This is a so-so phone
##I bought this phone in replacement of my lost v400, I was really excited about this new model I got, however, not everything's perfect, I'd like to share with my thought with whoever will buy this phone, but again, the choice is yours
[t] Dont buy Motorola V551 from Cingular. Period.
##This is my personal experience
##May be it is just me with these problems
##I have bought this phone in March 2005
##It worked OK for 30 days
##After 30 days there were problems
battery[@]##* I was not able to disconnect the calls, sometimes I had to pull out the battery to disconnect the call
##* Some of the keys especially '*' and '#' keys were not functioning, I had to apply very high pressure
##* When I am on a conference after about 10 minutes, people were not able to hear me
##The line was still connected though
##* I could never get the bluetooth working
##* Worst of all Charging this phone was a big head ache
battery[@]##It took 10 -15 minutes to ensure that the battery is charging
##may be some sort of loose contact, many of my friends also have the EXACT same problem in charging
##Then I called Cingular and they have replaced it with a new phone (same model, I hoped this one would work)
##It worked fine from April - September
##Then suddenly one day the same problems mentioned above have started
##Finally after being patient for a month, I have replaced the phone again
##The third phone was even worse(Same model again, my mistake, I should have replaced it with a different phone after 2 bad experiences)
##It did not work even for one day
##There was no signal at any time
##When some one called me It gave s a wierd message 'Please enter the mail box number of the person you are calling'
##I was not able to take or make calls
##That is when I decided to replace the phone with a different model
##I finally settled for a Razor
##I am hoping this works fine!!!
[t] THE BEST PHONE
##I've had my Motorola V551 for the 2 years I've been with Cingular
##I'm now due an upgrade, but I'm having trouble finding a phone that is better than this one! I'm trying to be smart and read reviews for any phones I'm considering, but there's always something about each and every one that I look at that turns me off from them
##I keep comparing the features to that of my phone, and none so far are worth me parting with, what I think, is the perfect phone!I'm not so high-tech, but I know what I like
[t] Not bad
##I bought this phone Feb '05 and for just over a year, it worked beautifully
##I had owned 3 different Nokia non-flip phones before switching to Motorola
##I don't use the phone too often, maybe 100 minutes per month
camera[@]##The camera works very well, I got some high quality shots
##I found that I was able to navigate my way through the menus very well
##It's pretty sturdy, I've dropped it about a handful of times and had no ill-effects
##Over the last couple of months, though, I've noticed that it doesn't always want to charge and now I can't use the phone without using the speakerphone
##The hearing part seems like it's stuck on the quiet setting, I can barely hear in my quiet office
##And then the two speaker thingys you use for the speakerphone are on opposite sides so you have to keep turning the phone to have a quality conversation
screen[@]##The screen might be on the small side
##I wasn't thrilled with the instruction manual
ringtones[@][u]##It was huge (half might have been in Spanish) and it just seemed to me that its intent was to teach you how to take pictures and download 
button[@]##It didn't really say what the button on the right side is for
##(I still don't)I also had a few problems charging it but not many
##A friend with the same phone had to develop a system to get his to charge which included wrapping the cord around the phone and only charging once it was down to two bars and not later
sound[@]##I was very happy with this phone until the sound died
[t] Not bad at all !
##Our household uses two of these phones - one local and one that travels around the country
##We've had both for a year and a half, and have never had a problem with them
##Nice weight, easy-to-use features, keypad large enough for larger fingers
##Have used a variety of headsets with this phone, and the phone worked great with all of them (the problems we had were with the headset, not the phone)
##Camera takes some decent pics
##Vibrate feature - unlike other phones - is strong enough to actually feel it
##Have never had a problem with reception
##even with one antenna bar, you can still manage to hang onto the call
service[@]##The only problem we've ever had (other than the various headsets) was with the wireless service
##My previous Motorola lasted over 10 years
##I hope these last at least half that long
##I'm sure they will
##All in all, a pretty decent phone for the money!
[t] HEL* in phone form
##This phone is a p
##o
##s
screen[@],sound[@][u]##It crashes randomly leaving you with a white screen and a static  that will deafen you if youre having a conversation
screen[@],camera[@]##the camera phone quality is horrid the video isnt great either ive had one of these for about a year now and i have had nothing but trouble since day one ive had 3 replacement phones so i know it wasnt just a faulty one and just today my v551 has apparently lost all power to the screen so open or closed i cant see anything so no txt messages no phonebook no games no pictures no nothing if you have this phone already i feel your pain, if you havent gotten it and are considering it STOP IT!
[t] Unhappy with the selection
##Cingular selection of phones is very limited
##I chose the Motorola V551 phone and hate it
##I bought it primarily as a telephone and find that it has very bad reception and a very slow keypad
##It can't keep up with my fingers and often leaves me somewhere in the menus I didn't plan on
[t] v551
##this phone is
##well
##a lot of things
##first of all i own it and i at first was not pleased
##im on my second phone already as the first one broke very soon after purchase
##pros
[t] Don't buy it
##I've had this phone for more than a year now and finally broke down and replaced it
##I am writing from my own experiences and that of my friends who also own it
##On average, I was able to get less than 24 hours standy-by time (that's right, without talking at all)
##The bluetooth is flaky and cuts out often
##The charger connection is fairly delicate and sometimes falls out
##Really, the only redeeming value of the phone is it's terrific display
##I got the phone for $50 and still felt that I got ripped off by this phone
##Just don't buy it
[t] Frustrating
##I've had this phone for a little over a year
##I loved it when I first got it, but it was all downhill after a few months
##Battery never lasts more than 12 hours(thats without any talk time), dosen't recognize when its charging most of the time, outside cover is cracked, the actual phone part does not work at all anymore
##Its hard to get good reception on it and it drops all of my calls
##I've not been able to use anything but speakerphone since july
##First it was just low volume, then it quit completely
##I know at least 6 people with this phone who have the same or at least similar problems
##I've taken good care of my phone, never dropped it or anything, and yet its worse than phones I've had in the past that were 2+ years old and had been dropped, etc
##My cell company also will not let me upgrade, so I think any day now I may just throw my phone out of my car on the freeway
[t] My first motorola
##I have had so many cell phones but have stayed with the same carrier (Cingular, which is great), but this one is the best
##My last phone was a Sony Ericsson T226, the worst phone ever, so coming from there to this phone is quite the upgrade
##As many have mentioned, the video quality is not that great, but what do you expect from a phone? I am very satisfied
camera[@]##I use the camera a lot more than I expected and there is quite a bit of storage
##The game-yes just one-is just a demo and it sucks, but you can easily buy the full thing or another one, I'm just cheap
##The phone book is a little irritating in that my names are there about 3 or 4 times depending on how many numbers I have for that one person
##I tried scrolling down to "more" when adding names but they are still listed more than once
##But the categories are great and very useful
##I love the bluetooth capability too, I plan on buying the HP photosmart 475 printer with the adapter so I can wirelessly print my phone's pictures-sooooo cool! The surface of the phone is quite fragile, though
##I wear mine on a belt clip and I tend to walk too closely to walls I guess because I get a new scratch it seems weekly, but while it was still all new and shiny, it was very sharp looking
##Overall, a great phone for the everyday user who knows how to read a manual
##Hope this was helpful
[t] Worst phone ever
battery[@]##Has a short battery life
##If not being used, two days, otherwise shorter
##The menu navigation is difficult and non-intuitive
camera[@]##The phone camera picture quality is poor and you need additional network services to move pictures off the phone
##More money
##The phone has buttons on the outside that can change the ring style
##So while it sits in your pocket it can change to silent mode or vise versa
##Very annoying
##By the time I realized how poor this phone was I was well over my 30 day trial
##Now I'm stuck with this lemon for two years
[t] Recurring sound problems
##I bought a new V551 in March of 2005
##Over the months, it got harder and harder to hear the person calling me
##By August, it was impossible for most of the calls I received
##Cingular shipped me a refurbished replacement, but that phone developed the same problem in the three weeks asfter it arrived
##Buy something else
[t] Disappointing on all fronts
camera[@]##Battery life is limited, one day maximum (and that's without the camera use or any other non-phone item
##) Talk time will cut into that as well, so forget about the projected 7 hours/7 days talking/standby time
battery[@]##Motorola has already replaced the battery to no avail
service[@]##Next route is a distance Motorola service center
##One of the helpful sales persons told me that there had been problems with this phone, along these lines, but you can probably do better with an entirely different phone
service[@]##I appreciated the generally helpful service lines, but if the phone doesn't work right in the first place, what's the use? Seriously consider another phone from Motorola and/or an entirely different brand unless you are a glutton for punishment
[t] Great Phone, I Love It!
##I just got my first cell (the mororola v551) a few weeks ago
##So far it's a great phone
##Here are the pros and cons
[t] I LOVE MY V551
##I bought this phone after taking my v220 back to the store the same day I bought it
##This is a great phone
##It isn't flemsy like some of the phones out there now
##The picture quality is excellent! It adjust to the light and you can zoom in and out
##The speaker phone is an excellent feature, it's so clear on both ends that you really don't need an earpiece
ringtones[@]##The quality of the ringtones is great
##The only reason that I'm not giving it five stars is because the lens doesn't have a cover on it, so it's not protected from dust and things like that but, don't let that stop you from buying it, I just wipe it down using a Q-tip occasionally and it's fine
[t] Warning existing Cingular customers##Cingular and Amazon
##com have not yet established a method for customers to transfer their current number to a new Cingular account
##Unfortunately, in order to port your previous number, Cingular will cancel the account that Amazon
##com activated and will activate a new account with the ported number
##This process makes you ineligible for the Amazon
##com rebates
##We hope to offer a porting option in the coming months, so please check back at [
##]
[t] Not at ALL impressed
##I purchased the Motorola V551 this past February to replace my Motorola T720, which dropped calls and cutout constantly
battery[@]##The V551 can't keep a battery charge for more than a day at a time
battery[@][u]##I followed the instructions to ensure the phone was fully charged before using and to ensure the first time you let the  totally go dead before recharging
##It dies CONSTANTLY!In addition, I travel quite a bit for work and I have had a TON of dropped calls with this phone
##I will be in the middle of a conversation and it kills the call
##I call back and it drops the call again
##I absolutely hate this phone and I can't wait to get rid of it
battery[@]##I have taken the phone into Cingular various times and they tell me there is nothing they can do about it, but would suggest not buying a Motorola product because their phones are known for 1) not having a strong battery life and 2) poor reception
##My thought is why are they selling Motorola's products if they don't think they are worthwhile?? I would caution anyone to skip this phone and go with a Nokia!
[t] Not good for use outside/sunlight
##If you need to use this phone alot outside in bright conditions consider getting something else
##You absolutely cannot see the LCD display on the cover or the inside of the phone in sunlight
##This means you cannot see who is calling, you cannot see if you have a missed message, if you do have a message you cannot see who it was from, you can't type a text message, you can't read a text message, you can't make a call (except blindly) and you cant take or view a photo if there is bright sunlight
##If you take this thing skiing, to the beach, etc
##it's almost unusuable
screen[@]##Except for the problem with viewing the screen it seems to be a fairly well designed and full-featured phone
##I'm not overly fond of the motorola menu navigation, but will get used to it
[t] Marriage counselor wanted
##Others covered most of my pros and cons
##Big Problem
##The phone can't be used while charging
##It's a big deal, because charges are frequent and looooooooonnnnnnnggggggggg
##Lots of downtime with this phone
##Pro
##I get long periods of quiet-time when the phone isn't working
##Second Problem
##Browsing and text messaging will happen frequently and accidentally unless you are very, very careful
##Pro
internet[@]##I am no longer internet illiterate, and have really enjoyed the strange people I've been text messaging
##Third Problem
##I bought this phone for my wife, too, and she won't let me forget it
##Pro
##She can't call me to complain about it
##p
##s
##If someone can figure out how to use this phone while it's charging
##I'll post a correction to this review, and, maybe my wife will start talking to me again
[t] Dropped calls and poor volume
##Like most new cell phones, this one has hundreds of features, all of which are useless if you can't talk with someone
##I don't care about games, screens, ring tones or whatever, I just want a cell phone where I can reliably communicate with someone
##this phone isn't it
##And after reading the other reviews, I'm glad I'm not alone
##Granted, for the first several months, I'm sure I was satisfied
##But the low volume and continual dropped calls have made this impractical to live with
##Lesson learned- make sure you read the reviews from people who have lived with this phone for at least half a year
##And I see on the Cingular webpage that other customers have the same complainnts for the V551
##I'm surprised Motorola or Cingular hasn't acknowledged this
[t] It's a normal weak user interface Motorola phone
##I almost totally hate it
##I think I'll be finding a way to go back to using my much better, old Nokia 6800
##As usual, it's a wierd, unintuitive, takes time figure out and work around its bugs and wierdness, Motorola phone
##It is better than past Moto phones, though
service[@][u]##The only thing this one has over the Nokia 6800 is better voice quality, which may be more about the old ATT  than the phone
##Battery life & charging
[t] Excellent Phone
##I bought this phone because it was a Editors choice in a leading computer magazine
##I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish
##Plus points of this phone include
[t] Good phone.
##After reading some of the reviews here, I was a bit hesitant to buy this phone, but decided to anyway since it came with a rebate
battery[@]##Many people said that the battery doesn't last very long
battery[@]##I'm sure these people did not read the instructions; in particular, the part that said to let the battery die out completely before charging it for the first few times
battery[@]##After doing this, my battery lasts a few days, which is good considering how much I use the phone
##The bluetooth feature is awesome
##I transferred mp3's from my computer to the phone and used them as ringers
##I can also import my contact s from outlook, which is nice since I don't have to key in all my old numbers into my new phone
[t] Good reliable phone
##I've had this phone for about 3 months now and have not had any problems such as dropped calls or any operational prolbems
##The only thing I have had any problem with is understanding the manual
##There is not enough detail about how to make certain things work, but eventually I was able to figure out everything that I wanted to do
##Over all I think it's a great phone and I really like the speaker phone part especially when listening to messages and being able to write down numbers without having to hold the phone on my shoulder
[t] UPDATED##I just purchased this phone to replace a Nokia 3650
design[@][u]##Good in many respects listed below, but one thing I find incredibly wrong-headed about the  is this
[t] I HATE THIS PHONE
##I'm not the type that goes through cell phones quickly
##My last phone was a Non-Color (yes, it was old) Nokia
##I was excited to get this phone but boy was I disapointed
##I have owned the phone since it was released, so consider me a V551 expert
##Here are all of the cons (i hate this phone so much I'm not going to list any pros other than all of the cool shortcut keys
##all of the cons negate the pros)
##*The phone is really slow in everything it does
##When you answer it by flipping it open, you have to wait 2 seconds to say "Hello" or the person won't hear you
button[@]##When you hang up, you have to hit the end call button repeatedly to end the call
##When you scroll down the phone book, the scroll is slow
##When you access a new menu, for instance office tools, the phone takes a while to go into that menu
##I think you get the point
##the phone is freakin' slow
button[@]##*The convenient web-browser button is not so convenient
##I keep hitting the darn thing on accident
button[@]##I try to hit the red end call button ASAP, but since the phone is soooo slow, it takes forever to exit the browser
##As a result, a certain # of bytes are transfered and I fork over about 4 bucks to Cingular every month, which pretty much erases my employment discount
##*Speaking of rip off, you cannot download a game or ring tones without being double-charged
##Cingular charges you for game/ringtone and on top of that charges you for the download when your phone accesses the browser
##What a CROCK!!!!*When scrolling through the phonebook, trying to find a name, you cannot search for the name
##The phone will only let you scroll to the first initial, say an "S" by pressing the 7-button 4 times, then you have to manually scroll down to the name you want
##If you try to type the 2nd letter of a person's name, let's say a "C" for Scott, the phone will take you to all of the C's (Chris, Carter, Cynthia, you get the idea)
##This drives me nuts
camera[@][u]##*The  is terrible
##The camera's eye is inverted into the phone's casing, causing dirt to build up and cover the camera's lens
##Thinking that the quality issues will be solved by cleaning the lens, i couldn't be more wrong
##The phone appears to take decent pics, but when you save a pic that looks good to the phone and then go to view it later, the pic is blurry as hell
##I don't understand why it looks fine before it is saved, and so completely horrible later
##The funny thing is, i'm not exaggerating
camera[@]##*While I'm not a big fan of camera phones (but still find them practical), I thought i'd mention this for those of you who are
##When taking pictures to use for your wallpaper, it's extremely hard to get a picture centered
##The phone lets you choose if you want to have a full-screen wallpaper, centered, or tiled
##But for some reason, some of the pictures you take cannot be centered
##I took a pic of a logo of my favorite sports team to apply as my wallpaper, but when doing so half of the logo would be cut off, no matter which of the 3 settings i chose
##It took me an hour to get the wallpaper i wanted because of quality issues (blurring) and centering problems i endured
##Friends with other phones have much better cameras (LG's, Razr, etc
##)*You cannot save text messages that you are in the process of writing
##If someone calls you when you are writing an essay of a text, you have to start all over
##yes you are screwed
##The phone doesn't save all the work you have done to the "drafts"
screen[@],button[@]##If you close the phone during a text or accidently hit the red end call button(the universal button on cell phones that takes you back a screen or to the phones main screen) which is next to the "3" or "def" button, the phone won't save your draft to the drafts
##I don't understand why the phone even has a drafts function since you cannot even manually save a text message to the drafts
##The only way the phone saves a message to the drafts is if someone textes you while you happen to be writing a text (yes, during those eventual text messaging wars with the girlfriend)
##*Drop calls
##I pretty much get reception everwhere
##However, in my bedroom and living room, where i do get full reception, I will lose a call between every 1 and 3 minutes
button[@]##Funny, cause i will have full service, then i hear static, then nothing, but the other person can hear me, so i look at by bars which are incrementally decreasing, which then i hit the end call button (remember repeatedly because the phone is slow), and when the phone finally ends the call, a few seconds later all of the bars shoot back up and the phone is fine
##This process repeats
##*Charging is slow
##If the phone does die completely, you can forget about using it for the next 30 min to an hour, cause that's exactly how long it takes for the phone to get enough power to start up again
##If you try to power the phone before that, it will shut off before it starts up all the way, and you have to wait even longer to use it
##Don't forget to charge it every night if you are a heavy talker or you'll be using pay phones the next day
##Also, i don't know if this is just my phone or if it is quite common
##Apparently the male end of the charger that connects to the wall, and the female end on the phone has a loose contact
##My phone will only charge if i keep the charger's connector pressed to the right
design[@][u]##I don't know if that makes sense, but because of the wiggle room caused by the  of the forked shaped connector, the phone will only charge if you keep the adapter from wiggling and to the right
battery[@]##I don't have an issue with battery life like other v551 owners, but i would if i didn't charge every night
screen[@]##*I'll get a blank or white screen sometimes
screen[@]##I don't know why but it seems as if the phone freezes for about 10 seconds, but then goes back to the main screen and is fine
##It's bizarre
##Also the phone will not let me switch skins
##When i try to switch skins the phone goes through this freezing process
##I think i read from another review that there's a bug or somehting, but it seems that when you open up the box of your 551, "you never know what you're gonna get
##"*You cannot use the phone's cool features, such as voice dialing; assining #'s as work, home, cell, pager; assinging pics to phone #'s; etc
##unless the phone # is saved to the phone
##That would be fine, but the phone does not allow you to save the # to both the cell and the SIM without making duplicate entries in the phone's phone book
##Yes, that means it takes even longer to scroll through the phone book
##So, if you transfer a # to the phone but do not leave a copy on the SIM (because you do not like seeing duplicate entries in the phone book), you cannot use your SIM in another phone and have the same #'s
##Or if something happened to your v551 but not your SIM, the #'s would be lost
##It's just dumb technology to me
##My ancient Nokia and even more ancient phone before that could store the same # on both the phone and the SIM without making a duplicate entry
##I do have one # with a duplicate entry in my phone book, and when i select her name to send her a text message, it checks off both entries even though i select only 1 of them
##I'm not sure if i'm being charged twice for sending 1 message
##*When i first got this phone my girlfriend would say that she texted me and called me, but i wouldn't get a text or a missed call (guess how many fights that caused?)
##She thought i was crazy until she borrowed my phone one day and witnessed it herself
##A month ago, i didn't receive any calls, voicemails, or text messages for 3 days
##Right when i thought i was a total loser, my phone started blowing up with 3 day, 2 day, and 1 day old messages that were back logged
##Yes my phone was on the whole time, yes i restarted it during the three days, and yes i could make outgoing calls
##I could probably blame it on Cingular, but i hate the V551 so much i have to say it's the phone
##Don't buy this P
##O
##S
##Go with the much LIGHTER and sleeker samsung e316 or e317
##I just received a used e316 and it works great
##it even has a color external LCD (pics!!) that the 551 doesn't
##If you need Bluetooth try the lighter and sleeker Razr, but i'd be reluctant to after such a bad first impression with Motorola
[t] Worst Cell Ever !
##I have to replace this phone 3 times (all under warranty) before I got one the kinda work and still have problems with that one
##I give this a 1 star I would give it a - if I could
##I hate this phone so much I can not wait until I can get a new one
##*The phone is really slow in everything it does
##When you answer it by flipping it open, you have to wait 2 seconds to say "Hello" or the person won't hear you
button[@]##When you hang up, you have to hit the end call button repeatedly to end the call
##When you scroll down the phone book, the scroll is slow
##When you access a new menu, for instance office tools, the phone takes a while to go into that menu
##I think you get the point
##the phone is freakin' slow
button[@][u]##*The convenient web-browser  is not so convenient
##I keep hitting the darn thing on accident
button[@]##I try to hit the red end call button ASAP, but since the phone is soooo slow, it takes forever to exit the browser
##As a result, a certain # of bytes are transfered and I fork over about 4 bucks to Cingular every month, which pretty much erases my employment discount
##*Speaking of rip off, you cannot download a game or ring tones without being double-charged
##Cingular charges you for game/ringtone and on top of that charges you for the download when your phone accesses the browser
##*When scrolling through the phonebook, trying to find a name, you cannot search for the name
##The phone will only let you scroll to the first initial, say an "S" by pressing the 7-button 4 times, then you have to manually scroll down to the name you want
##If you try to type the 2nd letter of a person's name, let's say a "C" for Scott, the phone will take you to all of the C's (Chris, Carter, Cynthia, you get the idea)
##This drives me nuts
camera[@]##*The camera is terrible
##The camera's eye is inverted into the phone's casing, causing dirt to build up and cover the camera's lens
##Thinking that the quality issues will be solved by cleaning the lens, i couldn't be more wrong
##The phone appears to take decent pics, but when you save a pic that looks good to the phone and then go to view it later, the pic is blurry as hell
##I don't understand why it looks fine before it is saved, and so completely horrible later
##The funny thing is, i'm not exaggerating
##* When taking pictures to use for your wallpaper, it's extremely hard to get a picture centered
##The phone lets you choose if you want to have a full-screen wallpaper, centered, or tiled
##But for some reason, some of the pictures you take cannot be centered
##I took a pic of a logo of my favorite sports team to apply as my wallpaper, but when doing so half of the logo would be cut off, no matter which of the 3 settings i chose
##It took me an hour to get the wallpaper i wanted because of quality issues (blurring) and centering problems i endured
##*You cannot save text messages that you are in the process of writing
##If someone calls you when you are writing an essay of a text, you have to start all over
##yes you are screwed
##The phone doesn't save all the work you have done to the "drafts"
screen[@],button[@][u]##If you close the phone during a text or accidently hit the red end call (the universal  on cell phones that takes you back a screen or to the phones main screen) which is next to the "3" or "def" , the phone won't save your draft to the drafts
##I don't understand why the phone even has a drafts function since you cannot even manually save a text message to the drafts
##The only way the phone saves a message to the drafts is if someone textes you while you happen to be writing a text (yes, during those eventual text messaging wars with the girlfriend)
##*Drop calls
##I pretty much get reception everwhere
##However, in my bedroom and living room, where i do get full reception, I will lose a call between every 1 and 3 minutes
button[@][u]##Funny, cause i will have full service, then i hear static, then nothing, but the other person can hear me, so i look at by bars which are incrementally decreasing, which then i hit the end call  (remember repeatedly because the phone is slow), and when the phone finally ends the call, a few seconds later all of the bars shoot back up and the phone is fine
##This process repeats
##*Charging is slow
##If the phone does die completely, you can forget about using it for the next 30 min to an hour, cause that's exactly how long it takes for the phone to get enough power to start up again
##If you try to power the phone before that, it will shut off before it starts up all the way, and you have to wait even longer to use it
##Don't forget to charge it every night if you are a heavy talker or you'll be using pay phones the next day
##Also, i don't know if this is just my phone or if it is quite common
##Apparently the male end of the charger that connects to the wall, and the female end on the phone has a loose contact
##My phone will only charge if i keep the charger's connector pressed to the right
design[@][u]##I don't know if that makes sense, but because of the wiggle room caused by the  of the forked shaped connector, the phone will only charge if you keep the adapter from wiggling and to the right
##Batt life is bad I have to have a charger every wheres I go (work,car,home,girlfriends house) I have to charge it every night or the next day the phone is a paper weight
screen[@]##*I'll get a blank or white screen sometimes
screen[@]##I don't know why but it seems as if the phone freezes for about 10 seconds, but then goes back to the main screen and is fine
##It's bizarre
##Also the phone will not let me switch skins
##When i try to switch skins the phone goes through this freezing process
##I think i read from another review that there's a bug or somehting, but it seems that when you open up the box of your 551, "you never know what you're gonna get
##"*You cannot use the phone's cool features, such as voice dialing; assining #'s as work, home, cell, pager; assinging pics to phone #'s; etc
##unless the phone # is saved to the phone
##That would be fine, but the phone does not allow you to save the # to both the cell and the SIM without making duplicate entries in the phone's phone book
##Yes, that means it takes even longer to scroll through the phone book
##So, if you transfer a # to the phone but do not leave a copy on the SIM (because you do not like seeing duplicate entries in the phone book), you cannot use your SIM in another phone and have the same #'s
##Or if something happened to your v551 but not your SIM, the #'s would be lost
##It's just dumb technology to me
##My ancient Nokia and even more ancient phone before that could store the same # on both the phone and the SIM without making a duplicate entry
##I do have one # with a duplicate entry in my phone book, and when i select her name to send her a text message, it checks off both entries even though i select only 1 of them
##I'm not sure if i'm being charged twice for sending 1 message
##*When I first got this phone my friend would say that he texted me and called me, but I wouldn't get a text or a missed call (guess how many fights that caused?)
##He thought i was crazy until he borrowed my phone one day and witnessed it hiself
##I didn't somtimes receive any calls, voicemails, or text messages for hours sometimes a day
##Right when i thought i was a total loser, my phone started blowing up with 3 hours, 2 days, and 1 day old messages that were back logged
##Yes my phone was on the whole time, yes i restarted it during the three days, and yes i could make outgoing calls
##Don't buy this P
##O
##S
##Go with the much LIGHTER and sleeker
##I would never buy another Motorola again after such a bad impression with the Motorola V551
[t] Good Style for Price, Typical Motorola Phone
##When it comes to buying a cell phone, most people look for several different attributes
[t] If you're having problems, check for phone firmware upgrade
##I don't normally review items on Amazon but after reading some of the bad comments for the V551 I had to put in my 2 cents
##When I first got the phone in Dec 2004, I was very unhappy with it
battery[@]##I had lots of dropped calls, lousy battery life and I had trouble hearing my calls
##I got so fed up I called Cingular to complain
##I was informed that there had been a firmware upgrade for the phone
##Unfortunately (or fortunately depending how you look at it), users can't update the firmware themselves
##Cingular had to send me a replacement
##The replacement phone works much better
##No more dropped calls
battery[@]##The battery life is better and I can actually hear my calls now
##Is the phone perfect
##No
battery[@]##I'd still like better battery life
##I find it annoying how easy it is to accidently change ring styles (When my wife can't reach me it's usually because I bumped the phone, setting it to the silent ring style)
##Before the firmware upgrade I'd give the phone a 1 star rating
##After the upgrade I rate it 3
##5 to 4 stars
[t] Very satisfied - A Good Buy
##This is a great phone with some very good features
##I just swithched from TMobile since the servic coverage was lousy in my area (ohio)
##The cingular coverage is great here and the phone is great
##+&#62;Speakerphone - The speaker phone is very clear, Both parties can hear & talk clearly on this
camera[@][u]##&#62; Camera - The  takes pretty good quality pics, though not like a regular digital  but as along as it you just want to capture pics for the moment, it's good
##&#62; Bluetooth - works awesome! I connected my jabra bt 250 with the phone, and it works great
##I leave the phone in the living are and use the jabra on the 2nd floor, and it works just fine
##&#62; Good feel of the phone, nice rubbery outer feel to the phone
##&#62;I was also able to download some ringtnes from wap sites, so that works nice
ringtones[@][u]##My friends from outside USA were able to send me  which worked just fine on this phone
##&#62; You get it for free
##CONS (minor)&#62; You cant activate the speakerphone without opening the phone & also the speakerphone is behind the phone
[t] V551 experience
##The phone is overall a complete packeage
##However, there are a couple problems that I have experienced with this phone
battery[@]##First, the battery indicator goes very quickly from full to 2/3 to "low battery"
##Second, the brushed metal on the fron of the clamshell does scratch easily
##Other than that, the hardware is excellent
##While the programming could be somewhat improved, the important thing is that the phone will be able to coexist quite nicely with my laptop (a 12-inch iBook with a Bluetooth adapter)
##Call quality is very good, the Bluetooth implementation is very similar to the V600 (transfer audio, photo, and video between computer and phone easily) once you get it paired with your computer
##Games
[t] You'll be pleased with it
##After doing some homework/research on it, I ordered it and just received mine
##Glad I did
##BTW, thanks for all the reviews here, it did help in my decision-making
##It's a nice phone with some great features i
##e
##bluetooth and EDGE
##This is few steps up from the Moto V400 (what I previously owned, another good phone)
##I would highly recommend this to those who like flip phones and don't mind not having the smallest cell phone around
##A lot of positives have been written here so I'm going to jump to things you might worry
internet[@][u],button[@]##I didn't give this phone 5 stars because the hotkey for the  is placed too close to the send button that it can be accidently hit too easily
##Each time you press it, Cingular will charge you 2 cents for the 2k data usage if you have the pay-as-you-go plan, even if you cancel off immediately (what a great way for Crapular to make few extra bucks!)
##Another reason
[t] I'm Very Pleased
##Bottom LineStrongly recommended
##This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it
##Based on my research, the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3(although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum)
##From the many online reviews I've read, early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls
##I haven't seen many of those types of comments lately so I'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out
sound[@]##Pros--Very good reception and sound quality
##Gets three and four bars in my office; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC--It's nice looking; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made (the NEC was plug ugly)
##Nice raised number keys
ringtones[@][u]##--Calls and rings can be made very loud (which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase, or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring)--Decent quality pictures for a phone camera--Bluetooth--MP3 ; also extensive selection of built in  (although most aimed at young users rather than professionals)
price[@]##--Good speaker phone function--EDGE makes for fast web browsing--Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP--much easier than the NEC--I can now access Hotmail which I couldn't with the NEC--Nice looking screen--ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC--Good voice dialing (the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and didn't actually dial which the Moto does)--Ability to change ring volume and method (to include a useful vibrate then ring method) with external keys is very handy; ring volume can be made very loud--Buttons and functions are highly customizable--Very good date book--Quad band (I've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries, including Iraq)--Nice price ($74 from AT&T;)Cons--Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out, it's fine
##You can store five numbers and an email per entry
##(You must save entries to the phone not the SIM, and organize by primary listing)
##It's not the best--the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information--but it works
##--Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto's recommendations--completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times--it's fine
##Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use
battery[@]##(As another reviewer noted, the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically
##)--Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos--a Star Tac and V60
screen[@]##But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket--Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call, not before--Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds
##You have to touch a key to make it come back on
price[@]##This can interfere with things like downloads--Screen icons are small and fuzzy; the user's manual doesn't explain what they are--Small navigation keys, but that's the price you pay for a relatively small phone--Of the three built-in skins, two are glaringly bright and tacky
##As with the ringtones, Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals--When using a Bluetooth headset, the V551 will only use a cheesy, stock ringtone--personal ones will not work--You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it (although this only takes about ten seconds)
##--Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer--Lousy user's manual--Lousy user's manual--Did I mention the lousy user's manual? (this is inexcusable)--Voice dialing is not universal
##In other words, it "learns" one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase
##--Stubby antenna (although this is a trade-off
[t] Great phone
##I've had the v551 for about three weeks and had nothing but good luck with it
##After reading some of the reviews, its obvious they either didn't take the time to read the manual or didn't look at all the menu options
##Example - you can store multiple numbers per name
##My wife got the Razor at the same time and while I like a lot about that phone, this one was a better fit for me
##Pros
[t] Motorola V551 Is A Winner --- Great Value For Money !
##Recently I bought my first flip-phone after saying goodbye to my trusty ol' 4-year old "Candy Bar" Nokia 5190 (it was hard giving it up--sniff, sniff, I'll miss you)
[t] Phone is fine, rebate offer is not.
##The phone has performed well
sound[@]##No dropped calls, good reception and sound quality
##I'm charging it every other day
##As of now, March 2005, you will not get the rebate if you are porting your existing phone number to Cingular
##Amazon seems to be unable to say that while you are ordering the phone with a Cingular plan but they will make it perfectly clear when the phone is delivered
##If you can't get the rebate you may be able to get a better deal at the mall and have the phone working that day
##See if you can port your number and get the rebate at
[t] Battery problem? What battery problem?
battery[@]##I have to say, I spent a lot of time fretting about whether to buy this phone because my old phone had such good reception and battery power
##But
##Let me say
[t] Motorola gives you the razor, you buy the blades
##Motorola's latest high-end flip-phone doesn't have the sexy form factor of the RAZR, but it's loaded (some might say bloated) with function
##This is a worthy successor to the TDMA series that started with the StarTac and progressed through the V60 model
##It features a similar form-factor to the latter, though slightly thinner, but with a wealth of new features
screen[@][u]##The most obvious improvement over the V60 (and its follow-on, the V60 color) is the beautiful interior color 
screen[@][u]##Unlike the V60 color, the V551's  is actually used to display improved graphics (including wallpaper, saver, downloaded images, or photos/videos shot with the phone itself)
##Also improved is the outer display, which is large enough to read comfortably (unlike the poorly thought out multiline display of the V60 color)
internet[@][u],ringtones[@]##As with many advanced GSM phones, the V551 provides features like  browsing, a low-res still and video camera, and MIDI and MP3 ringtones
##In addition, the V551 is Bluetooth enabled, which allows you to transfer data from the phone to a Bluetooth enabled computer without wires
##You can also use a Bluetooth headset, which seems minor, but is hugely convenient in the car
##On the downside, the V551 retains many of Motorola's classic drawbacks
##The manual is, to be kind, weak
##Large swaths of the phone's function are un- or under-documented
design[@][u]##The V551 also continues Motorola's poor ringer setting 
##In particular, if you have the phone in an audible alert mode and you wish to switch to vibrate (e
##g
##, you find yourself in a meeting and realize you didn't turn the ringer off), you can't do this without the phone beeping
design[@]##The V551's stylized keyboard is difficult to dial without looking - the number buttons flush design is hard to pick up by feel
internet[@][u]##Further, the function buttons include an  browser key which is easy to press in place of the dial key
##Cingular's version of this phone (I believe the generic model is V550) is larded with Cingular-specific items
internet[@]##The internet browser mentioned above can be launched by several "handy" shortcuts
##In addition to the dedicated key, there are several items on the Media Mall home page that take you by browser to various Cingular locations
ringtones[@]##You can also get to the Cingular store via the ringtones panel
##This wouldn't be quite so bad if it didn't all feed into Cingular's incredibly transparent marketing plan
price[@],software[@][u],ringtones[@]##Want to load new MIDI or MP3 ringtones to augment the mediocre selection given to you with the phone? Buy them from Cingular's marketplace! Want to download your own? Buy Motorola's  plus USB/or/Bluetooth package for half-again the price of the phone (hey, I might as well just buy a bunch of ringtones from Cingular)! Same goes for games (none ship with the phone) and wallpapers
##You can use the phone with any Bluetooth enabled computer (or with a third-party Bluetooth/USB dongle) to download ringtones, but you'll have to surf around the web to find out how, as it's not documented in the manual
##While you're surfing, make sure to shop for a belt clip or case, as Motorola's declined to ship even the most basic version with this phone
##Overall I'm happy with the performance of this phone
[t] Still A Good Phone....BUT...
##This was my first review of this phone
##I gave it five big stars
##I was a little skeptical about getting any new phone
##I was quite attached to my samsung x426, but it was old, and outdated and didn't have some of the newer features that I needed and wanted
##I'm surprised, but I'm very very happy with my motorala v551
##It's not as sleek and pretty as my samsung, but it's more stylish than I had originally thought and it's got a nice feel to it
##Good weight and soft blue exterior - it feels quality
screen[@]##The screen is just as big and bright as my samsung and the interface is easy to use
##Text messaging is great and fast! It anticipates exactly what I'm meaning to say
##can a phone read your mind?? This one tries and does a good job
camera[@]##Ha! *kidding* The camera and video is good for a phone
##And you can take pictures of your friends and have their faces in your address book
##You can also assign different rings to each person in your address book
battery[@]##It has a crystal clear speaker phone, the reception is great, and the battery life is satisfactory too
battery[@]##Now, bluetooth is super cool! But, if you're surfing the web a lot or playing downloaded games (I've gotten addicted to cell phone tetris!!)It's going to deplete your battery life faster
##I'm pretty active on my phone but I still only charge it once every night
battery[@]##By the end of the next day I'll notice my battery is half down, so I'll HAVE TO charge it every night
##This still has never been a problem
##My Samsung would stay fully charged for DAYS
battery[@][u]##so comparatively I suppose the samsung has better  life but the v551 is still OK even with active use
service[@][u]##My reception is also clear, but I suspect that has more to do with my  provider than the phone
##I'm in an urban area so I always have all bars up
##The same was true with my Samsung
##It was important to me that all audio is loud
##I hear my callers loud and clear
##The ringers are loud and clear
##And you have the option of downloading any song you want
##if you need something even louder!!I've heard people with concerns over the manual
##but I found the set up for most of the features extremely easy
##I was able to set up all the major features without it
##Even though I wasn't familiar with the motorola interface
##I was also able to personalize everything easily and right away
##Everything is personalize-able even how you access the screens you use the most
##A nice touch
##And the Motorola can just do a bunch of fun stuff that my Samsung just couldn't do
##Also, if you travel overseas, or have friends all over the world, this phone works internationally too
price[@]##Not bad for the price
##This is a good solid phone that does its job and has nice techie features too
##I really can't think of anything bad to say about it
##except that it's not as girly and cute as my little Samsung! But, I must say, it's cute enough
##Bottom line is
##if you want a simple to use durable phone, or something more substantial with high-tech capabilities (but without the high-tech price, of course) then you should definitely take a look at this phone
##Here's my second review after having the phone a little longer
##I wrote another review for this phone and gave it a five-star rating, but after having it a little longer, I'll have to take away a star
price[@][u]##It's still a GREAT phone, especially for the  and the features
##It's a good value for the money
##Consider this however, especially if you are purchasing this phone as your only phone and you choose not to have a ground line
##I used to have a Samsung 426x, which was a super little powerhouse of a phone but lacked any cool features
##It would stay powered up for a week, was always crystal clear, only a few dropped calls now and then, and I NEVER turned it off
##I've found that with the Motorola v551 you MUST turn it off once a night and let it fully charge or you will suffer with dropped calls
##I think I kept this phone on for two weeks (charging it every night) then all of a sudden, I couldn't maintain a single conversation without major drop out calls
##I called the technical people and found that it is because this phone must be turned off every night and allowed to fully charge or it'll go screwy!I'm doing that now, and all is good with the phone again
##I kinda don't like to have to turn the phone off since it is my only phone, but the features and basic quality of the phone still outweigh this inconveniece for me
##But, keep this in mind if you're thinking about purchasing this phone
##Depending on how you use your phone, this could be a real problem
[t] Great Price for a Good All-Around Phone
##I got the Motorola V551 as a replacement for a broken Nokia phone that was no longer being offered by Cingular
##On a side note, Cingular was very helpful with replacing my faulty Nokia 6230
##The agent gave me the option between two replacement phones, a Motorola and a Siemens (I picked the Motorola because it was a flip phone and the Siemens was a candy bar style), and they shipped it to me via UPS overnight at no cost to me
##Plus, return shipping for my broken phone was free as well
##But back to the Motorola V551
[t] Only worked for 10 months
##Call me crazy but I actually expect a phone to last at least long enough to get you to the next 'free phone with sign-up' deal
##I just got this phone last December and it is already dying
##First, it stopped charging properly
##Then, I lose the ability to hear anything unless I am on speakerphone- which sucked from the beginning since it is grainy at best
design[@][u]##Besides this, it has some poor  features
[t] I can't hear most calls
##This is by far the worst phone I've owned
##This is the second v551 I've had because I had the first one replaced for the same problems I'm having now
##The problem is that I usually can't hear the caller unless I place them on speakerphone
##The problem is intermittent which makes it more frustrating
battery[@]##The second problem is that its difficult to make the connection for charging the battery
##I have to cram the cord into the phone before it makes contact
##Stay far far away from this phone!!
[t] Great Phone
##I had an LG phone and it was horrable I got the V551 before the summer and it has been great
##I work as a wildland firefighter in the summer and my phone has been awesome
service[@]##There has been numerous times in the forest and remote locations where I have had great service where no one else did
##I have always liked motorolas and this phone just confirms it
##A great buy
[t] Motorola V551
##This is not a bad phone overall
##I tried 3 other phones before settling on this one
##If the contacts are not working then try another cord
##I had the same problem and got a new cord and have n problem now
##Once fully charged I can go all day without needing a charge
##It is a little hard to hear on the handset but the earpiece is of excellent volume
##The phone is not hard to operate
battery[@]##The battery is like other slim phones you just have to have patience to assemble it
##You can customize the wallpaper and screensaver of your choice
##You can rearrange icons also of the order you like
##I am satisfied with this phone but arent we all always looking for something better?
[t] great phone for the price
price[@]##great phone, great price
##bluetooth, quad band, outer display, everything a phone should have is here
battery[@]##i love the outer display although i wished it could've been a little bigger and offer color display for a wallpaper and photo id, but it serves its purpose by displaying incoming caller name and reception bars and battery life
##the shell is nearly scratch free due to the cool rubbery surface
##its a phone where i dont have to worry about scratching or abusing since its fairly inexpensive with a rugged, yet beautiful construction
[t] Not this one either...
##As indicated in a review for the V600, I received the V551 as a replacement for the V600, after that phone had already been replaced several times
##Initially, I liked the V551 better, even though it is a less expensive phone
##It seemed much less "buggy" than the V600
##However, I have had more dropped calls, and more failed calls (which I initiate), and worse reception than with any phone I've ever owned
##And just like on the V600, the stupid mechanism on the left side of the phone changes the ringer capriciously
##Expecting a call? Don't hold your breath
##The ringer is now on "silent"
[t] Mixed Feelings About this Phone
##I have had this phone for over a month
##Here are my thoughts
##Pros
[t] AVOID THIS PHONE!!!!!
##I have a family plan with these phones, I have had to send SIX of these phones back for repair now
##If you're doing the math, then you will realize I have had to send back the replacement phones
##Every failure was the same, the speaker eventually starts to go out
##At first it it's random, and eventually it completely dies
##Motorola should get sued over this lemon of a phone
[t] extremely versatile for a good price
ringtones[@]##MOTOROLA V551Small enough to not be cumbersome, but big enough to not get lost (easily), the Motorola V551 is a versatile phone that offers users a number of options and is easily customizable as far as ringtones and other similar customizations are concerned
##It normally retails for 149
##99 with a two year plan, but is currently on discount for $99
##99 under the same conditions
design[@][u],battery[@]##The following outlines  specifications, features, battery life, call quality, and my own experience with the phone
##What's the V551 all about?The V551 weighs a light 4
##23 ounces and includes a 1 year manufacturer's warranty on itself and the included accessories
##It has 850/900/1800/1900 MHz capabilities which means not only will it work domestically, but it will also work internationally-perfect for the student studying abroad or the traveling corporate employee
service[@]##(Though, one will need to select an international plan with Cingular or establish a separate international account with another reputable cellular service provider
##) Talk time is up to 6 hrs and stand by time is up to 16 hrs as stated by the Cingular website
##I must say, however, that I have reached neither upper bound
##VersatilityThe V551 includes a number of features that owners can take advantage of if they so choose
##The features include*
[t] What good is technology if it breaks all the time?
##I got this phone because I thought I was really going to "get over" after the rebate ($75
##00 back!) But you can't submit the rebate for over two months, you have to wait for two months of bills to submit with the paperwork
##So now, of course, I can't find the stupid packing slip
##okay, that's my problem for being disorganized and renegging on my promise to myself never, ever, to buy something on rebate again
##Now the problem with the phone, this is the second time the SIM card has crapped out in about three months
##I assume, if this is like last time, I have to go to the store and get a new SIM card, but all my phone numbers will be lost, and I will have to reprogram them again
service[@]##I got this phone because I was sick of sprint, the cellular service and the snotty attitude
service[@]##Cingular service is Okay but this phone is a piece of poop
##I am never going to get a motorola phone again, my friend has that cool razor and it's broken too
service[@]##What a pain in the keester this entire service has been
[t] Battary and Address book not so good
##I feel battary stand by is not long
##Daily i should charge without fail
##I feel address book is not so flexible as Nokia
[t] This phone sux!
##Battery dies very fast in less than a day, very very very awful!
[t] Cingular customer service STINKS-17 people confirm my fear
service[@]##The phone gets 4 stars, the service 0 Stars for an average of 2
##I got my V551 on a Friday and tried calling to get it activated and getting my cell number from ATT first migrated and then ported to my new GSM phone
##The phone is nice but I have yet to get as good reception out of GSM at my home as the old TDMA Startac I had
##That was quite a phone, everything you need-solid and easy and intuitive to use
##Now to Cingular's TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, VERY BAD Customer Service
##To get the phone migrated-then ported I called Cingular, who after 2 people talked to me said I had to go to the store
##I went to the store and he said I had to do it over their phone-back to Customer care
##After talking to 3 people on their phone, the phone CS guy gets on the line with the inside employee who can't or won't do what I need to do-Port me over from ATT to the new phone so the guy on the phone sends me home with a number to call to do it 17 people-I counted and only 6 hours on Saturday and 2 on Friday-and I had to double pay my bill
##Did I mention that you can have everything entered for a phone number and if you close the clamshell without pushing DONE, it ALL goes away? Or that you have to turn the speaker off before closing the clamshell to hang up, or that anybutton answer doesn't work
##I want a phone that works like a phone
[t] Simply superb
##I like Motoroals V551 is bcoz of it has got speaker phone and it speaker can be on while dialing it self
screen[@][u]##Which has got very  resolution
[t] Richards review
##Great phone easy to use,have this phone about 3 months now
##Had the v400 nice phone,but the v551 better phone great camara,video phone
##Bluetooth awesome
##Highly reconmend this phone V551 for the money
##RPotter
[t] Junk
##Standby time is about 12 hours max
##Drops line all the time
##A nightmare
##Worst cell phone I ever owned
[t] Great Phone
##Full of cool features
camera[@]##bluetooth, still and video camera
size[@]##Nice size
##Good call quality
[t] Risky phone- stay away
##I was dumb enough to sign over to Cingular from AT&T and this is the phone I got back on Dec 27th to be exact
##Within 30 days I was having problems with the phone and returned it to the store for a new one
##Then in March I had more problems, since it had been more than 30 days I had to return it via mail, now here it is July and yes I am having problems again!!! I don't think there is any reason why I should need another phone within 7 months! I am debating on returning this one or payin the $150
service[@]##00 to cancell my cingular service
##It's absolutely rediculous that I need a 4th phone in 7 months
##My friend has the same phone and got it around the same time I did and she is on her second phone
##I would not recommend this phone to my worst enemy
[t] Cingular lowering the bar...and Motorola is not good
service[@][u]##I have had Cingular for two years and found the  to be very unreliable
##I have had tons of missed calls, people try to call and it goes directly to voicemail even though my phone is on, and I won't get voicemails for hours after people call
##Also Motorola makes the worst phones
##The V551 is better than the last Motorola phone I had (V120 I think)
##I went throught four in a year and I did nothing to the phones except try to use it
##Overall I can't wait for my contract to be over and don't bet a Motorola phone
[t] Poor battery life w/ Bluetooth!
##Battery life was okay until the phone was about 4 month old
##Had to get a new one and see the same issue
battery[@]##Note that running this phone w/ a Bluetooth headset (also by Motorola) may drain the battery in the course of a single day! Recommend - Don't buy!
[t] Not a bad phone, but I'm now a little leary of Motorola.
##I've had three Nokias in a row, but I switched to the V551 after trying my wife's flip phone
##I often talk in a noisy setting, where flip phones tend to beat out "candy bar" phones
##I really like the form and function of this phone
##True, while navigating to different functions is initially clunky compared to the Nokia operating system, once I figured out how to assign shortcuts with the V551, no problem
camera[@]##The phone receives and transmits good voice quality, and has a decent camera and speaker phone
##I like the fact that it can use any headset equiped with a standard mini-plug, which is a plus compared to the Nokia's non-standard plugs
##However
##The V551 is noticably inferior to my Nokia 6820 when it comes to reception in areas of weak signal
##I live in a hilly area, and in spots along the road where the Nokia would break up for a second or two, the Motorola drops the call completely
battery[@]##The phone no longer answers a call upon opening the cover, and the battery charger connection is giving me trouble
##With the three Nokias I've owned previously, I've never had a quality control issue
[t] Feature Rich, But Troublesome
##I won the phone so I'm not as critical as I would be if I had paid for it
screen[@],software[@]##With that said, be aware that the first software release had a problem that caused the screen to lock up--it would be white
##The quick fix was to close and reopen the flip
software[@][u]##The better fix is to return the phone for a new one or to have the phone flashed with the newer 
##I've also noticed that I drop more calls when using the V551 versus a Blackberry 7280
##Motorola should have done a bit more laboratory testing before releasing the phone
[t] Has every feature you could want
##I had purchased this phone back in November 04
##I bought my phones online but couldn't migrate my numbers online
##So I was sent two new phones (I ordered two
##don't worry!) but, as advised by Cingular Online Support with new numbers also
##When I got the phones I went to a Cingular store and within 20 minutes I had my old numbers on the new phones, except the new numbers were never cancelled
##I later had explained to me that you can't have two numbers on one handset
##I was told that was the cause of the miserable performance
##After the numbers were cancelled, BAM! It was like a brand new phone
battery[@]##It works flawlessly and at first the battery would not hold a good charge
##After about two weeks of use it holds a charge for about four days with moderate talking
##One more bonus is that some of the V551's come unlocked! My friend put his T-Mobile sim in my phone just for laughs, and it totally worked
##I highly recommend this phone
[t] You'd be better off not buying this
##Worst phone I've used so far
##It's so bad that I have made a solemn promise to myself that I will not buy ANY Motorola products
##1
##Battery life &lt; 1 day2
##Phone charging is difficult as the contacts for the charger don't seem to hold up and it's a nightmare
battery[@]##Low battery life -> bad charger
##it's a cycle and a mad rush ensues in trying to charge the damn thing before it dies on me
##3
##The user interface is extremely annoying
##I'm used to entering something on the phone and seeing it happen right away
##On this, the lag between user input and the action happening is easily noticeable
##You can type out a number or choose a menu item, and it takes a while to see it happen
##4
##It's not put together right
##Try changing the battery, or the SIM and you'll know what I mean
##5
##Dropped calls - every 5 mins
##or so into a conversation, this thing will just drop the call
##Terrible
##That's about it
##I do not know a single person who has this phone who doesn't hate it and has gone back to their old phone (I know 3 others
##) I made a mistake, you shouldn't
[t] bad phone, bad service
##I switched to Cingular from Sprint because of the increased national coverage
screen[@]##I don't like the phone and I don't like the service! The phone first; I can't see the screen outdoors! Non intuitive menus
internet[@],button[@]##Sometimes it charges; sometimes it doesn't! I too, have also hit the Cingular button and been connected to the internet
##and billed for it! You can only press the number buttons so fast
ringtones[@]##Try punching in a number with the speaker on! A few more onboard ringtones would have been nice too
##As for the service; The phone doesn't work in my apartment
##I live 10 mins from downtown Philadelphia
##It doesn't work in my girlfriend's apartment in Cranford NJ
##Tons of dropped calls
service[@]##Very unreliable service
##And why do they make it so hard to get a rebate?? My advice is to try somebody else
[t] Great Phone. Dreadful Customer Service (BEWARE PORTING)
service[@][u]##Cingular has dreadful customer 
##The phone is great but I tried porting my number over from T-Mobile and it was a MONUMENTAL task
##First I was on hold for over 45 mins with Cingular
##Wrong department
##Gave me another number
##Dead line
##Called back
##Waited 25 minutes
##Told me that I had to go to the store
##Went to the first store
##They told me that I had to request the port BEFORE the phone was activated and it was now too late
##Went to ANOTHER store
##They said they could help
##Took them an hour, but it happened
##NOT impressed
##So, if you need to port your number - be aware!
[t] Phone is hot!
##This phone is hot! Looks good, has a lot packed into it
battery[@]##The only thing questionable is the battery, but that's only if you're constantly using the phone and if you don't charge it properly (let the battery die after each charge for a couple of days)
battery[@]##Otherwise, the battery is not bad
##Picture quality is great (even when zooming in), video quality is good
##Instruction manual not too useful, but it's very easy to find out a lot of features just by exploring
##Speakerphone is great (especially when playing MP3 ringers)! Cop this phone
##especially if you're gettin a new plan!
[t] Paperweight...
##Bought this phone earlier this year and I really regret it
##I bought a Motorola v551 phone and realized that it doesn't hold charge beyond a day and I talk at most 1 hour a day
##I then realized that more than half the time I charge, the phone doesn't charge at all! Infact the phone displays a message "Unable to Charge"
##I realized I can only use my phone 3 or 4 days out of the week when I'm lucky enough to get it to charge
battery[@]##Frustrated with this poor performance I replaced the brand new battery with yet another brand new battery
##No luck
##I called support and had the phone replaced but same problem still persists
##I read through several message boards and noticed many other people frustrated with the same problem
ringtones[@][u]##To make matters worse, this phone locks all  and games you purchased for the phone
##You can NOT take it out of your phone using bluetooth so if you need to replace your phone be prepared to repurchase all the games and ringtones!!
[t] The V551 Mortorola
##The telephone is a lemon plain & simple
##It has so many problems you can not even imagine
##If approached to buy this tele " Run "
##Cingular is a good Company, I give it a 5 star plus , they just need to take this telephone off the market
[t] Do yourself a favor, go with Verizon
service[@]##Cingulars customer service totally sucks
service[@][u]##They made me hold 2 hours every time to get a warranty exchange on my phone, and finally had to pay $175 to disconnect the 
##I regret changing over from Verizon, really do
[t] WOW!!!
##this phone is very sleek
price[@][u]##I think it is a good  also
##plus it is part of the biggest network ever! and just because I'm a kid don't think I don't know
##I have done all of my research
##I had a nokia 6800 and that was a good phone, but this phone takes the cake!
[t] I am so disappointed with this phone.
##Both my wife and I hate this model, we are stuck with it until the contract expires
##The volume for the phone and speaker phone is not loud enough
##We have it set on the loudest setting, and it is not loud enough
##The phones we had prior with Sprint, we had to turn down the volume for being too loud
##The address book needs to be reworked
##If you have three numbers for one person, all three are separate entries
##Plus, the fields that can be used are different on the phone and what can be saved on the sim card
##The ringer volume is too low even with it turned all the way up
button[@][u]##There is no outside  to silence the phone in a meeting without hearing a tone while working through the different ring tones
##The absolutely worst thing about this phone is the dropped calls
##If I am making a business call with this phone, the first thing I do is tell the other caller that the phone will probably drop the call after 5 minutes
##I am not sure if the drop calls are Cingular's fault or the phones fault
service[@]##But, Cingular still sells this phone so I am thinking that it is the Cingular service
##My wife's phone is worse than mine
##When I have tried explaining our problems to the Cingular rep they just give the blank stares like they do not care or they hear about it so much until they do not care any longer
##The truth is
[t] NO battery life. This phone is terrible!! DONT BUY IT!
battery[@]##I bought this phone two weeks ago and the battery life listed in standby mode says "170 to 240 hours"
##Thats directly from motorola in their documentation
battery[@]##The truth is this phone lasts about 4 to 5 hours, EVEN IN STANDBY before the battery is dead
##Use it at all and it will last you about 2 hours
##Use bluetooth in the car? It will last about 30 minutes
battery[@]##Check google with a search for "v551 battery problem" and witness the truth
##This phone is trash and nobody should make the error of purchasing one and wasting your money like I did
##Motorola has no plan to fix this problem, so dont buy this phone
[t] A BAD dEAL
##I bought a MOTOROLA V551 one year back
##It is very difficult to charge this phone
##If you insert the plug of charging cable, it keeps saying unable to charge
##You have to give it side pushes and try all stupid gimmicks before it starts to charge
##There have been days when it took me20 MINUTESto start the charging of this phone
##The colors blue and silver are not flattering either
##Why does nt motorola give some good colors, may be just metallic ones will do
##I NEVER got the rebate on this phone
##Either cingular or amazon is to be blamed
##Overall this phone will get 2 stars from me
[t] me hate this phone
battery[@]##terrible respnse time the battery life is less then 5 hours topsflimsy as hek and terrible reciption
##My dads girlfreind had this phone and she had it 4 about 7 weeks and then she closed it from talking and then it just shut down and never worked again
screen[@][u],sound[@][u]##dont get it worst phone you will ever getbut it does have a good color  but the front of the phone is week and flimsy and scratches really easliy and plus if your a kid and you go to school and you have the phone on you best have it off because like most phones it makes an annoying beebing  when you have a new voice mail or missed call and it doesnt have silent mode so when you are in school or in a meeting you have to have it off if you dont want it to make any noise
##by kevin nolan
[t] Ccell phone
##i got this phone as a christmas present this year and i find it a great phone
##the reseption is excelent
##the only this i dislike about it is that it cant a long peroid of video, but other than that it is an awsome phone, i strongly recomend this phone
[t] Poor reception
##GThat's about it poor reception
##Phone feature are good, pictures are poor quality and so is reception
[t] THIS PHONE SUCKS - PIECE OF CRAP
##I will give this phone a rating of 5 piles of b@@l s@@t
##The worst combination on earth is Cingular with Motorola V551
##First, to make/receive call, you need a good phone instrument which V551 is not
##Second, IF you have good phone, you should have good singals which cingular does not provide
##This phone is bluetooth enabled
##But in its life time, it did not find any other bluetooth enabled device even if the other device's bluetooth is on and its within 1 centimeter away from it
##Besides, you can take pics, video, but there is no option to send this pics/videos by bluetooh
##What a piece of crap
##WHY THE HECK I get photos/videos for
##If you press a key, it will take your lifetime to load the item you want
##I can keep going & going & going
##IF YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE, DON'T GET THIS PHONE
##I am desparately waiting for my one year to be completed
##That will be the happiest day of my life
##If you buy it, you will make the biggest mistake of the your life
[t] Do not buy.
##Keypad doesn't work
##The phone is cheaply made
##Drops calls
##Battery life 20 minutes
[t] Bad battery life, period.
battery[@]##I would rate this phone with 5 stars if it weren't for the wretched battery life
##I'm getting only 24-36 hours on a recharge
##(And yes, I've turned off Bluetooth; and yes, put it through several recharges; and no, I'm not using a rapid recharger)
##Cingular graciously replaced the battery, but the replacement seems to be doing even worse
battery[@]##The worst problem is that the battery meter goes from two bars to none in a matter of minutes
##This is in stark contrast to my older Motorola v60, which seemed to go forever
##I would avoid this phone
[t] Would be 5 stars if not for the battery
battery[@]##The phone is packed full of great features, however, the battery life is horrendous
##A full charge only lasts about 1 day with moderate use
##It also seems to take a long time to charge; about 2+ hours from dead to charge complete
[t] Does anyone know how to reset the alarm clock feature?
##I just purchased this phone recently and for the amount of features and options that come with phone the manual is pretty much useless
##They might as well not even give you one
##There are certain features that I have no clue what they do, whether or not it would be better for me to change them of turn them off etc
##Battery definetily could last longer
##Does anybody know how to clear out the alarm clock so I can start entering new times
##After you enter 5 times you can't enter anymore and I am not sure how to erase them so I can start entering new times again
[t] No Calling Card Functionality,.... I returned it!!!
##I have been a Cingular customer and always liked the coverage
##So decided to upgrade with them after my contract got over
##I got the V551 after signing an additional 2 year contract (which I always think is not right)
##I had a few issues with the phone though
##- NO CALLING CARD functionality
##I make a lot of international calls and having this is imperative
##All Nokia and SonyErricson phones have that
##Its stupid to not have it
##This was probably the one thing that made me return it
##I could have lived with other issues
##- Battery indicator not accurate
[t] AWFUL PHONE THAT HAS AN AWFUL BATTERY LIFE
##I HATE THIS PHONE
##IF U HATE HAVING TO CHARGE YOUR PHONE EVERY TWO DAYS (OF LITTLE USE) THEN DON'T BUY THIS PHONE
##I JUST HATE IT AND I DON'T RECOMMEND IT AT ALL
##SAD BUT TRUE
##SONY ERICCSSONS ARE BETTER THEY CAN GO DAYS WITHOUT BEING CHARGED BUT THIS MOTOROLA HAS TO BE CHARGED EVERY TWO DAYS AND IF U TALK ON IT, THEN ONE DAY AND IT NEEDS TO BE CHARGED
##MOTOROLA PHONES ARE AWFUL
[t] wut r they talkin about?
##i have the motorola V551 and this phone is extremely awesome
##just about the same as the razr, but without the thin part
##if this thing does have a slight flaw on
camera[@]##its the camera
##doesnt have flash so taking pictures in dim areas is not great
##but it works well nevertheless
[t] HORRIBLE PHONE
##This is perhaps one of the worst phones I've ever used
##I've constantly have had bad reception (family and friends have also complained with this), the layout is hard to use, and i get tons of dropped calls everday
##it seems as if cingular decided to release a phone without seeing if it actually works
##if you actually want to talk to people - this is not the phone to get
[t] Good but not great
##I've had this phone for a couple of months now and I am quite satisfied with it so far
##the picture/camera quality is far better than my old SE T610 and I love the real mp3 tones that it supports
##I make my own little mp3 ring tones on my computer and transfer it to the phone via bluetooth
##that is really cool
##Reception is ok, i suppose but definitely better than my old phone
##Battery life is average
##Also love the speaker phone but the speaker is located on the back of the phone, which does not make much sense
##Overall, it's not a bad phone
[t] WoW, THE Best phone I've had so far!!!!
##I had this phone for a little while now and I must say that it is the best phone I've had so far!
screen[@],sound[@][u]##The vga screen provide really crisp and clean pictures, the  quality is fantastic and the bluetooth features makes transfering data (graphics/ clip) to and from your laptop/desktop so easy, as well as hands/cord free driving!
##The only con I have is not about the phone but its instruction manual, very confusing to follow, some features are not listed on the contents pages, you have to go to the index pages and hope to find what you looking for
##Otherwise, this is a fantastic phone, Good job Motorola!
[t] Poor quality phone
##I'm an old AT&T customer
##I was going overseas and wanted a Quad phone, so I paid $249
##99 for this at the Cingular store, plus $25 to unlock it so I didn't have to upgrade my phone plan from the existing converted AT&T to a new Cingular plan
##I am returning it tomorrow
sound[@][u]##The  quality is poor, the menus are confusing, and I get no reception at my house or in any of the small towns nearby
##The only places I can make or receive calls are the major highways
##I'm keeping my Sony Errickson T616, even though it doesn't work in Asia/India/Africa
##The quality is far superior
[t] Horrible...Don't Waste Your $$$$
##I own a v551, my wife owns a v551, 2 co-workers of mine own v551's
##I think I have enough experience with the v551 to know that its a piece of junk
##Everyone I know, myself included, who owns one of these sorry phones has problems with it
screen[@],sound[@],battery[@]##Problems include repeated dropped calls, the phone turing off for no reason, dropping the blue tooth connection by itself, the screen going white for no reason, poor reception, lousy battery life, pathetic ring tone selection, terrible sound
##I could go on if I had the time
##In short, please take my advice and look elsewhere
##I have had such a terrible experience with this phone, that I have vowed to never buy from Motorolla again
[t] Nice phone, but BIG cons
##I will say that this phone has been through a lot of minor drops over its year and 4 months, seemingly unscathed
##I like the display and the overall form of the phone
##However, there are two HUGE cons which are forcing me to shop for another one
[t] Good Phone
##This phone is comfortable and easy to use
camera[@]##The graphics, camera and video are very good
##The only problem is the thing pushes you hard to use media links so Cingular can charge you for it
##Limited ring tones and hard coded media browser buttons all work together to send you to a place where they can charge for your visit
[t] No volume...also
##What a downer
##I bought the V551 phone because I wanted to support Motorola
##I paid $150 through Cingular
##I can't hear anyone anymore - the volume is just not there! What good is everything else about the phone if it doesn't work with it's main purpose
##I'm going through the process of getting a replacement through Cingular
##We'll see how it goes
[t] phone not reliable
##I have used nokia phones for years and assumed that since their contact/address layout was similar to MS Outlook, all cell phones would likewise be similar
##how wrong I was
##If you intend to use this phone to manage business and personal contacts, get a Palm or Nokia
##Also, the speaker is known to burn out on these phones
##Motorola knows this and continues to sell a sub-par product
##I can only use my phone with a bluetooth wireless
##The speaker has been replaced 3 times!!!! Thanks a lot Cingular and Motorola, what a team
[t] Incredible Phone
##I have had several different carriers and lots of cell phones in my day and this has probably been one of the best phones ive had to date
service[@]##I had nextel which in my opinion was the best wireless service I had found but when i went away to school it didnt work because they only work in major metropolitain areas
##So I needed to find a new cell phone carrier which led me to cingular
##Now I had friends who had the occasional complaint about cingular but what carrier doesnt have people bad mouthing them (as you can read by the reviews on this site) but they had merged with AT&T and while i wasnt a big fan of AT&T i thought id give them a try
##So I went with the V551 on the recomendation of a friend who worked at cingular and it has turned out to be just phenominal
service[@]##I have had service out in the middle of corn fields and pig farms as well as any highway ive driven
##I get an occasional deadspot if in out in the boonies but in the city i have no trouble at all
##The phone itself is awesome as well, the talk time is great and the stand by time is unbelievable
battery[@]##I often tease my roommates and freinds cause they have to charge theirs on a dailybasis or they run out of battery while we are out and about
##I charge mine normally at night but if go away for the weekend i toss my charger in my bag just in case but I can usually go for the whole weekend without charging
size[@][u]##The construction is sturdy and the  is just right
##it doesnt feel like a flimsy thing thats going to break on you
ringtones[@]##I also bought the USB cable and i make my own ringtones and its great that the phone plays MP3 format so my ringers are usually much better than most people
##The cable also comes in handy when you want to download pictures and you dont want to mail them
camera[@]##The camera quality is nothing spectacular and lacks a flash but i was shopping for a phone not a camera so i didnt care that much about it
##The bluetooth connectivity is great too, i have a motorola bluetooth headset and its the great thing ive ever bought
##it allows full control of your phone from your ear and you can just toss it in your pocket and not have to worry about fishing for it if youre driving or if its in your bag
##The range on it is great as i can leave it on my desk and go to most of my apartment and still be able to talk on it
##I also connect my laptop and my palm pda to the phone which i have used it as a modem several times and have had no complaints
##the only set back i did not like is that if you are on speakerphone the speaker is on the back and the mic is on the front so you have to find a happy medium between hearing the people on the call and them hearing you
##You also must becareful with the charger and make sure you properly insert and remove it from the phone, i damaged one like this but i got it replaced with the warranty and i am more careful now
screen[@]##The outter screen is also small and monocrome so it doesnt allow for pic caller id if the phone is closed but the monocrome screen is visible even in the most intense sunlight so its a decent trade off
design[@]##All in all the phone isnt that pretty too look at and is of very typical design but why mess with someone that tried and proven
##The phone is the best phone you can get for your money and will serve you well if you dont abuse it
##I have dropped it on wood floors and carpet and even asphalt once or twice and its still ticking cept for a few nicks on the case
[t] Who Knows?
##I'm on my second V551
##I had a Motorola T720 that I loved
##So did my teenager
screen[@][u]##Well, his  developed issues that prevented him from seeing his displays
service[@]##Luckily we had purchased a service plan from Best Buy when signing up with Cingular the year before
##So they replaced the phone with the V551
##He got my old T720, & I got the V551
##I got recharged for my ringtone-Star Spangled Banner, & my screensaver was no longer available at Cingular
##But no problem as the V551 has a camera, & my 11y/o found flag/eagle/Statue of Liberty pix on the web & voila-took a pix & saved it to the phone
##The sim card saved some numbers, but of course not most, so that takes forever to redo
##Well right at first I had trouble hearing the callers
##I was forever bumping up the volume
##I went to Best Buy, Walmart, wherever I found Cingular, trying to hear better
##I wasn't the only one apparently
##Then a few weeks ago, people were saying they had trouble hearing me
##I became the voice yelling,"Can you hear me now?" What clinched it for me was last week when I left 3 messages at home to my family who was home, & they didn't pick up because they couldn't hear me
##As I went through messages I heard why they couldn't hear me, because I couldn't hear them either
##I know the phone was refurbished
##I didn't drop it
##I didn't have charge issues
##I like the menu's& phone book
##I just couldn't hear it well
##So I just got another V551 from Cingular itself this time
##Luckily for me the phone had a year warranty from Cingular, because of course 90 days had passed from Best Buy
##So far I can hear & am heard
screen[@]##I'm not pleased about the loss of my screen picture & ringtone-AGAIN-to be charged-AGAIN-for my ringtone
##Of course when changing the phone #'s to the SIM card, most of the cell phone #'s were saved, not all, but I lost everything else
##So I spent 2hrs replacing what I could remember
##I took the old & new phone in to a Cingular store hoping they could retrieve the numbers from memory? in the old phone
##Well they said did, but they didn't add anything new to the one's I already had replaced
software[@]##I'm hoping to buy the software & cable to place all of it on my computer
##Sounds like I'll be replacing the phone soon
##It's interesting
##We got Cingular because they seemed the best for our life, but at Walmart, my phone doesn't work in electronics, but my husbands V188 thru T-Mobil does
##My neighbors went Verizon because her husbands phone thru T-Mobil didn't work when hunting in the hills/valleys
##I loose calls all the time where you would think you'd be covered
##Cingular has roll-over minutes which saves them from being changed by us for Verizon which has way cooler phones-esp
##Sanyo's
##Thanks for input people
##RLT
[t] Works well to me
##After some frustrating months with my Sprint/Samsung which dropped calls 98% of the time while at home, I switched to Cingular/Motorola 6 weeks ago and it's been working without a problem
ringtones[@]##I also like the customizable features and been having fun to take pictures and setup my custom wallpapers and ringtones
[t] Mediocre Phone
##I really wanted to like this phone
##It has a nice solid feel to it, especally compaired to some other plasticy phones
##First the good points
[t] Great phone -
##Used overseas only in Taipei, Beijing, ShenZhen
service[@]##No US service
##Upgraded from a V400 because I wanted BT
battery[@]##IMO this is a very solid phone in terms of construction, battery life, signal reception
##Had not seen any problems such as call dropping or poor signal quality problems
##Earpiece volume seems to be adequate (for me)
##Ring volume could be louder but the polyphonic ring tone helps it
##Battery life seems to depend on locality where the phone was used
battery[@][u]##I have seen the  needing to be recharged in a day or 2, or it can go 3 or 4 days without needing to be recharged for similar amount of use
##Quite happy with the phone
[t] Excellent; no dropped calls; week-long battery charge
##I was surprised by the performance I've gotten so far out of my Motorola v551, after reading the reviews here, I was a bit worried about the new purchase
##The first charge lasted a full week (7 days!) with light usage (some Bluetooth transfers, a few calls, a few photos, even a couple videos)
##I did turn it off at night, because of the recommendations in other reviews
##Granted, I used it pretty lightly, but it lasted that whole time
##No dropped calls
##Perhaps they've updated the battery/firmware? Or perhaps it's a model-by-model quality issue
##Anyway (knock on wood), mine's been great so far
camera[@]##I like the camera (my first camera phone); voice quality and reception are excellent
##The menus took a little figuring out, mostly because I'm used to Samsung menus
##If I were redesigning the phone, I'd swap the two top buttons that are used for almost every menu action -- the left one should be the "yes" or "change" button, in my mind -- but I've already adjusted pretty quickly
##One important note
[t] Some are V551'sgood some are bad
##I am a a former AT&T; customer, now Cingular "blue"
##My first example of this phone had a firmware bug (that is well known on some of the cingular forums) that would cause the phone to reset when you tired to change SKINS
battery[@]##Also the battery life was under 24 hours
##This phone was locked to AT&T; SIMS and had cingular logos one it (the cingular logo key and start up logos)
##It would not work with a Cingular SIM even though it was completely branded Cingular
screen[@]##The replacement phone (new still during 30 day period) had no cingular key or cingular start up screens (only an "MMode" screen
##It came with more ringers and did not have the firmware bug
battery[@]##I have run it 48 hours on a charge and still had three bars of battery showing
##It too is locked to AT&T; SIMS
##For the most part I like this phone
##Bluetooth functionality is not as nice as my Treo 650 (Sprint)
camera[@]##Pictures are fine for 640x480 camera
##Time and caller id are nice on outside
##Size is a bit larger than some but for many users this will be a plus
##CONS
[t] well put together.
##I've gotten the phone just recently, i was hesitant at first bec
##of its ergonomic style
##but soon as i got a feel of the phone it sort of grown into me
##it's loaded with good features such as stream video, camera, voice record, speaker, real music tone
##and much more
##overall, if you are looking for a good phone with less pretty penny, i would invest in Motorola's V551
[t] No Voice Dialing without additional "voice connect" service.
##Overall this phone works very well
battery[@]##I am very pleased with the voice quality, signal strength, display, keypad and battery life
##When used with Cingular, it does not support voice dialing unless you subscribe to the $4
service[@]##99 Cincular "voice connect" service
##The phone is capable of voice dialing but it appears that Cingular has asked Motorola to disable the ability to enter Voice Names in the phone's address book
##To get around this I use a Motorola V60 to add new phone book entries with a voice name
##This requires swapping the phone' SIM card between the V60 and V551 every time a new entry is added
##This phone would receive a 5 star rating instead of a 2 star rating if it did not disable entering voice dialing names
[t] Lousy phone
##I had this phone for a year
##During that time it continuously dropped my calls and told others my number was not working
##Sometimes when I placed a call it said the number I called wasn't a working number, even when I was just on the phone with the person at that number and got dropped
screen[@][u]##Then my  failed, all the color drained out of it (fade to black)
##I tried to use it anyhow but it wouldn't allow me to place calls
##Next it stopped accepting calls, and finally it won't even turn on
##So, now I am without a phone
[t] Life span is just a year
##I have had this phone replaced twice
##I liked the features, but if you use your phone a lot especially for business use, I strongly suggest you look into a nokia
##The earspeaker doesn't go as loud after a year of use and so I was forced to use either my speakerphone or bluetooth wireless piece to take in my calls
battery[@]##My texts messages get delayed or I receive my text msgs too late (unless you turn off your phone, take out the battery and put it back in
##sometimes it will solve that problem), but I've been having that problem on both of my replacement phones
##Also, it started to automatically end my calls
##My contract is ending next month, so i'm going back to Nokia
[t] Unreliable
##This phone seems to get fairly poor reception and drops my calls to the point of uselessness
##The bluetooth connectivity is unreliable and, more than half the time, requires a reset before it can be used with another device
button[@]##The user interface is not as usable and responsive (there is a slight delay in every button press)
[t] Love This Phone
##I have used this phone for a year now and love it
##I haven't had any of the problems others are listing
##Fits comfortably in the hand
##Bright display
##Good reception and voice quality
##Voice dialing great and works with Bluetooth headset
##Can set the phone to vibrate when you need to be quiet
camera[@]##Have used camera function to take some fairly good pictures-it is a PHONE after all
##The only thing I would improve on is having more memory for voice dialing
[t] Horrible phone
##I had this phone for 1
screen[@],battery[@]##5 years and after about a year the front screen broke and the battery would never stay charged
##I could charge it all night, and the next morning I would make a call and the phone would die on me
##another thing- horrible reception
##cingular is fine, but this phone is HORRIBLE
camera[@]##do not buy it!plus- its bulky and huge and the camera SUCKS
[t] It's good for what it is...simple
##I've had this phone for 6 months now
ringtones[@]##What I expected from a phone like this was that it could handle bluetooth and mp3 ringtones
##Pros
[t] good at first, annoying after a while
##I got this phone about a year ago, and I recently got another
screen[@][u]##It has good features, but is a small  and the keys are annoying
##It's clunky and very heavy, and doesn't fit easily in a pocket
##I switched to a RAZR and am much happier, and gave my cousin the v551
[t] Eh, could have been worse.
##If it had caught on fire when it rang
##Not so great
screen[@]##It tends to lose connection if I put pressure on the screen area, or cause massive static
##Seemed cool looking when I got it, but it's pretty awkward, actually
##Even with "maximum bars", it'd often drop, it had a very hard time connecting with online capacity even after several attempts at official maintenance
##Sound would crackle oddly, and the hinge often felt on the verge of overextension
[t] Motorola hardware's solid software sucks
##First, I got a V400
##returned for another in 5 months, and then another and finally Cingular offered me this phone (v551) as a free replacement
##Problem 1
[t] Not worth the money.
##I purchased this phone just over a year ago, and it broke down within a year
##The display, which was excellent, is now difficult to see when the "flip" phone is flipped open more than halfway
##I agree with the other reviewers who state that charging is awful
##The charge does not last more than 24 hours on standby and the recharging cord can come out and eventually it will not stay in at all
##I can't say if poor reception is due to Cingular or just certain areas that I'm in such as downtown Miami (the boonies)
##There are some good features to this phone, but none redeem the poor length of charge time, especially considering the Motorola specs
##There is a plethora of cellular phones out there; I'll be choosing something else, probably not from Motorola
##Don't choose this one and don't blame me if you do
[t] A Total Package, Baby!
##First off, I've had my v551 for months and haven't had ANY of the problems listed below
battery[@]##And frankly, wonder about the sort of battery abuse, etc
##some employ
service[@]##As far as dropped calls go, that's not the phone, but the service provider, normally
##If your radio or TV actually drops a signal, is that the cable provider or radio station? Or, your receiver? Hint
[t] great phone
##i dont know why people say this phone is so bad
##I used to have a T720, and this phone reminds me of that one
camera[@]##If you dont like the menu you can change it, the camera is decent, the conection is good, and i havent dropped any calls, and the speaker is ok
##( iam hearing impared so im sure its actually louder then i think) i love this phone
##The problems with the charger dont seem to be an issue, if you know what your doing you can figure it out
##its not rocket science
##i had a little problem with the car charger but i cleaned off the connectors and it worked just fine
##now im just waiting on my bluetooth headset to see how that works
##overall its a great phone
[t] I Love Car Rides
##Short Answer
[t] A little something from everybody
##My experience has mirrored that of the majority of V551 users
##In general, satisfaction for a couple of months, then frustration, finally downright disgust
battery[@]##Camera functions are okay ( good for screensavers & wallpaper), my battery life is good, (my wife's is bad), etc
##The worst experiences are dropped calls and many episodes of volume so low I have to activate the speakerphone (irritating in public)
##My wife's small company purchased a Cingular plan and offered these phones to employees on the same plan, with about 6 or 7 takers
##All but one have experienced similar frustrations
##I get amused when I read a review stating that that person has had wonderful experiences with the V551 and has "
##no idea why some have rated this phone subpar" because it has worked well for him
##The reason for reading several reviews is to get a general idea of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a product
##No one product is going to give everyone ALL bad or ALL good experience
[t] Like the Fun Boyfriend with the Shortcomings you Just Can't Ignore
##I have owned this phone for nearly two years
price[@]##- Sturdy Little FellaWhen I was shopping around for a new provider and phone, I found that Cingular was offering this one at a really low price (under contract, of course)
size[@]##My first cell phone had been a Motorola (one of those gray, solid analog ones that is about twice the size of your average current 'clamshell' type), and my recollection of my former phone's sturdiness is part of what prompted me to get the Motorola v551
##The v551 has not disappointed me in this area
##My former job involved a lot of running around town, and I would keep the phone on a holster on my jeans so that it'd be readily available for me to answer quickly
##Needless to say, I've dropped the phone more times than I can remember and aside from a few scratches on the silver plate on the front of the phone, you'd never know to look at it now
screen[@]##- Handsome, TooThe screen on the phone is a beauty
##The size, clarity, and rich color are great
##My phone came pre-loaded with LOTS of graphics, including clipart in ready-to-use e-mail templates, as well as a generous amount of wallpapers
service[@]##(I don't know if this is from Motorola, or if it has something to do with my service provider
##)- Fun To Play WithThis phone can do a crazy amount of stuff (calendar with alarms for reminders, games, mix your own ringtone, voice-control, the list goes on and on)
camera[@]##I'm just going to cover what I feel are the two main extras, the still camera and video camera
camera[@]##I like the camera on this phone
##When setting up your shot, you can do things like zoom in on the object and adjust the brightness
##I've taken a number of pics with my phone, and I usually e-mail the photos to myself to get them onto my computer's hard drive
camera[@]##When I used the camera feature for the first time, I was particuarly pleased with how well the picture had turned out, given the phone's size, etc
##The pics not only looked good on the phone's screen, but on my computer monitor, as well
camera[@]##The video camera is pretty cool, too, but I've never found the need to use it
sound[@]##I've only played around with it once or twice, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it includes sound with it's clips
##I think the clips last somewhere around 20 seconds
screen[@]##They look great when you play them back on the phone, too, but I have never tried viewing any of the clips on my computer, so I don't know how well they translate onto a bigger screen
##- Always ThirstyThis phone needs it's juice, and needs it often
##On average, I charge my phone every 1
battery[@]##5 days, and I often (unintentionally) let my phone battery run dry before recharging
##If you are one of those people who talks on the cell phone a lot, you are DEFINITELY going to be charging this phone every night
##This shouldn't come as a surprise, though
screen[@],size[@]##The sheer size and clarity of the screen makes it obvious that your phone is going to need a lot of recharging
##The charger is irritating
##This doesn't happen a whole lot (thank goodness), but there have been numerous times when the phone wouldn't connect with the charger
##Fiddling with and jostling the connection point seems to do the trick
##The worst experience I've had regarding this charger issue was when I spent about 10 minutes fiddling with it
##- Not All That DependableI've experienced more dropped calls with this phone than with any other phone I have ever owned, and I have owned a lot of phones
##I know that the dropped calls can't be due to a weak signal because I live and work right smack in the middle of town where the signal is strongest, and I haven't had this problem with other phones
##After a while, I noticed a pattern
[t] Nice, until...
##I've had this phone for 8 months, and it was never loud enough, always forcing me to really push it against my ear hard to be able to hear
##Recently this problem has gotten way out of hand and I have to use the speakerphone if I want to be able to hear the other caller
##Frustrating
[t] All around great phone with minor drawbacks...
##When switching from my old ATT GSM plan to a new Cingular plan, I was forced to get a new phone to replace my venerable Sony T616
##Originally I was leaning very strongly towards the Sony T637- very similar to the T616, and instant messaging that the T616 did not have
##However, thanks to a rather slick sales guy, I walked away with the V551
##First I have to explain why I got the T616- I loved it because it seemed to be a color, net enabled version of my beloved Nokia 8260
##So I never looked for a flip phone- it just seemed so unoriginal
##However, the downside of the 8260 and T616 was that their shiny exteriors scratched far too easily
##So, I never looked for the V551, however I ended up being very satisfied with it
##When looking for a replacement to the T616 I looked for several key qualities- Bluetooth, camera, IM and the ability to fit into the small box shaped indentation of my lower dash on my Isuzu Trooper without sticking up (I didn't want my phone flying around)
camera[@]##The V551 satisfied all of these and far more- the camera is 640x480, twice that of my old T616, and decent
##The relatively generous 5mb of memory was great, and the ability to record video is highly novel, however I really don't use it
##Add to that MP3 ringtones, Bluetooth, a stylish looking shell and I'm happy
##However, there are many areas that the V551 took a while to
##adapt to
##Sony users
[t] Total Disappointment. Why are they still selling this?
##I gave 1 star for it's "eye candy" design, that's about it
software[@][u]##I have had 3 of these phones (warranty for the win), with 3 different revisions of 
##First one dropped calls
##Didn't matter where I was, who I was connected to, or which part of the house or yard, or street I was in for that matter
##My mom and brother had the same exact phone, with the same issues
##Both turned theirs in for a new one under warranty
##I did the same
##I was sent another v551, and all was well for the first week, fewer dropped calls, but then the volume would randomly increase/decrease during calls
##My mom and I had the same problem, and sent ours back
##She was sent a new Razr phone (lucky her), while I was sent yet another v551, along with more frustrations
##Same deal, dropped calls and the totally frustrating volume issue all over again
##"Are you there?" "I'm here
##" "I can barely hear you
##" "I'll call you right back
##" So many times in one call
design[@],software[@]##Third Strike, finally I was sent a new v557, which is the same physical design (besides the color), but better software by far
##The v500-line of Motorola's ALL have the same faulty charge port! If you _have_ to have this phone, make sure you buy a cradle charger, and throw away the travel one
##Don't even bother buying a new one
battery[@]##Your battery will thank you
##Having to tape the cord down, and position the phone just right to charge is a total waste
battery[@][u]##It also reduces the life of your 
##Never again
##Cingular discontinued selling this phone, because they had so many people call in to have it replaced
##Edit
[t] Don't get this phone
##It hurts to say I was wrong but in this case I'll bite the bullet and admit
##I made the wrong choice
##I usually don't post comments but I was mucho motivated to save everyone else the same grief I and my friends went through
##You're probably reading this page because you think this is a great phone but trust me this phone is aweful
##Battery life lasts 1 day max, talk time is 2 hours max, and the phone won't charge properly
battery[@]##Heck, the guy at the Cingular corporate store even admits they've been hearing lots of complaints about this phone's battery life
##I've bought new batteries, twice actually but that didn't solve the problem
battery[@]##The Cingular guy told me that the phone is at fault not the battery
##Well what can I say, I'm using an old Sony Ericsson T616 now
##I know its old but it's 10times better
screen[@]##My friend who was using v551 went back to using a black & white screen nokia phone and he's happier with it
##I dare you to buy this phone
##Just don't say I didn't warn you
[t] The Best Motorola phone I've owned
##I don't know why people are so negative
service[@]##Maybe they should blame the service provider instead of the cellphone
service[@]##I have an excellent cellular service provider so therefore my cellphone is used to the max and performs consistantly
##This is my 3rd Motorola after previously owning a Nokia (which I will never go back to) and this is the best Motorola I've had
sound[@]##The sound is clear and crisp and the display is excellent
sound[@]##When I have the sound set to loud, it is LOUD!!!!I have a stronger signal in my "known" weak cellular zones and I've had fewer dropped calls
battery[@]##My phone doesn't take that long to charge and I keep it on 24/7 and have my display and backlighting kept to the very minimal to conserve battery life
camera[@]##The pictures are good for a camera phone, but that is not why I bought this phone
camera[@]##If you want good pictures and video it's best to invest your money in a good digital camera that takes mini-digital movies with highter MP's
##A phone is to make and receive calls on, although it is fun to play with
##The Motorola manuals are terrible and don't contain detailed information, which is a shame
##I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did
##I would reccomend it to anyone!!!!!
[t] Bad Battery
battery[@]##The battery is a big problem
##I bought it less than one month ago, and now it can only sustain one day, for about 1-2 hour talking time/day
##It's far below my expectation, even though I did what the retailer told me to do
[t] Quad 4
##The best reason to buy this phone is that it has all 4 GSM frequencies which makes it great for traveling as you're far more likely to be able to make a call in a foreign country with all 4
##Also being a flip phone which ends the call when you close it you don't have the risk of forgetting to end the call in Europe and getting a really big bill
##As to the hundreds of teenager features I haven't got a clue but it works better than my last phone
[t] Motorola & Bluetooth
##My CRITERIA for phone
service[@]##Bluetooth, GMS Global, camera, internet, compact & comfortable flip phone, Significant rebates with service contract
##Motorola V551 apparently met all these specs
##Connected V551 to my Power Mac via built in Bluetooth
##Was only able to see photos, but not able to sync contacts and calender from Entourage
##Needed theese contacts on my phones
##Found out that I could only sync via Bluetooth on a PC
##My old PC notebook did not include Bluetooth
##So I purchased USB Bluetooth adapter and phone tools
##This package costs about $85 thru Motorola
software[@]##There were major difficulties in gettting Bluetooth adapter and Mobile phone tools software to work on Windows XP Pro
##( Incompatable with Service pak 2) Finally successful with Motorola tech help
##Phone tools still has a problem
##It frequently wants to update itself
##The update causes it not to work
internet[@][u]##The good part about the this adapter is that it will allow this old Pc to to connect to the 
##I was also able to easily add any of the contacts that I had in Outlook to my phones (2 of them, family talk plan)
##(However the format automatically was full name, not last name first
##To change format I would need to alter each name individually
software[@]##The phone tools software will allow you to make these changes on your computer, which is easier than doinging it on your phone
##) Also speed dial numbers are automatically assigned as contacts are entered
##You need to enter preferred speed dial numbers to each contact and OK a change of number
##The bad part is that I will soon need to repace this old notebook with a Mac Powerbook
software[@]##When I questioned Motorola about Mac compatability, they stated that they have not got around to testing software for Mac
##Will think twice or thrice about another Motortola phone if they continue with this attitude
[t] BAD VOLUME!!
##My phone did work well for a few months when i first got it
##But for the past 4 months it has been getting harder and harder to hear people even though the volume is all the way up
##i have to push the phone so hard up against my ear that my hand starts to hurt
##Also, the camer takes good pictures, but then when u want to go look at past pictures you took, they are all scambled or blury
##i DO NOT recomend this phone
##I plan on getting a new and better phone as soon as possible so i can actually hear people when they call
[t] Sell your Motorola & Cingular stock
##First of all, sell your Motorola stock
##No one who buys this phone will ever buy anything made by Motorola again
##Your phone will break
##I am on my third, and you can hear only on the speaker phone
##I would return it for another refurbished one, but why bother? I would only be getting a refurbished unit that one of the other reviewers of this phone returned
##And do not expect eager cooperation from Cingular in dealing with this problem unit
##So sell your Cingular stock, too
##As soon as my contract is up, I am
[t] I've gone through 4 so far- you tell me.
##This phone is solid when it works
##WHEN IT WORKS
##I'm on my 4th, only because im putting up with this madness until my contract runs out
service[@]##I have no problem with cingular's service but this phone is a nightmare
##It just dies and cannot be restarted
##Apparently this IS A COMMON PROBLEM
##Why Motorola and cingular would continue to to put a defective product is beyond me
##I will not buy another motorola phone and if cingular doesnt cut me a great deal when my contract is up I will no longer use their services either
##Poor poor job on cingular and motorola's part
##Stay away
[t] A Very Good Phone
##This is the second V551 that I've had
battery[@][u]##First one had the common issue of poor  life
##I eventually found out that mine did not have the latest firmware and returned it for one that does
##Big difference! Battery life is much improved; not the best I've had, but certainly good
##Reception is also significantly better
##It's gone from so-so to very good in fringe areas
##I've only had one dropped call since the change and no missed calls (not sure if reception was addressed in latest firmware or if previous phone was somehow defective)
##Call clarity was always excellent on both ends
##Earpiece volume could be a little louder, though
##I like the overall feel of the phone; seems sturdy and well built to me
##Many complain of the Motorola UI, but I don't find it particularly confusing or hard to navigate
##I'd say no better or worse than Nokias I've owned
##I've also not experienced the menu lag that some have mentioned
##Another common issue is the accidental pressing of the side buttons when pulling it out or when it butts up against something else in their pocket
##I always keep my phone in my pants pocket, and honestly, that's happened to me only once or twice
##Not sure why that's a problem for some
##Address Book could be better
##Not a big issue with me, though
##BTW, some have said how it can't list all of a contact's numbers together under one name
##It's done by going to Address Book > Phonebook Menu > Setup > Change "View" to Primary Contact
##Hope that helps
##Camera is fine, I guess
##Video is kinda lame
##Both are easy to use, but neither is very important to me
##Manual is also lame
##Not a lot of information there
##Bluetooth works great! I recently paired the phone with a Moto HS850 headset with no problems
##Connects quickly and reliably every time
##15 feet's about as far away as I've tried it, and it worked fine
##I mostly just want a phone to make and receive calls, and I can do that with this one without worry
##So in summation, I think the V551 is a great phone
##Especially since they updated the firmware, so be sure you get a newer one!
[t] Feature-rich phone with some flaws
##I should begin by telling you that my expectations for cell phones were shaped by the motorola V60, my first cell
battery[@]##It had excellent reception, a sturdy metal case, and superior battery life
##This is what I look for in a cell phone
##Does the V551 measure up?First, the good
[t] I like it
##Just for the record, I have the V551m, a MuchMusic Edition V551, and it's on Rogers Wireless
##In spite of all of the nasty reviews for this phone, I decided to get it anyways
##I had an incredibly old Nokia, and I decided that it was long past due for an upgrade
##Overall, I really like this little phone
##It's bigger than alot of flips out there right now, but I like it
##It feels less flimsy
##I don't feel like I'm going to break it whenever I open it
##So now for the pros and cons
##PROS
[t] solid phone, recommended
##Purchased V551 a month ago after being a satisfied T721 owner
##This phone takes everything good about T721 and makes it better
##1) brighter display2) Bluetooth functionality (use this frequently with HS820)3) Speakerphone4) CameraThe minor negatives are
[t] Great Phone For Most Users!
##Pros
[t] Great phone
service[@]##I would like to point out to all the people that have reviewed this phone as bad because of service that the service has nothing to do with the phone and if you have cingular you will have the same service with this phone as any other cingular phone
service[@]##My friend uses this phone and we have great cingular service in our area
[t] I Like It!
##I really like this phone
##It has so many great features! The pictures it takes are great
camera[@]##You can't expect some top notch pictures that are similar to pictures taken with a camera but for phone quality pictures, they are pretty good
##I love the way this phone has the speed dials! It's great
service[@]##And some complain about the reception but usually that has to do with the area you live in and the service you have there
##My husband has this same phone and so does my best friend
##They both really like it also and have no major complaints! This phone is a lot of fun and I like it! I recommend it!
[t] excellent replacement for my StarTac
##Short response to previous reviews
[t] Nice features
##This is a very nice phone with quite a lot of features
##Prices range on this phone from free to as much as $149 or more
##With cingular I got mine for free - well three of them free actually with a recommittment of a 2 year contract
screen[@]##I have found this phone very instinctual to use which is nice and the key pad is easy to use during text messaging (unlike my last one) The color screen is lovely and great for games - altho- the phone comes with no games
##zero
##zip
##nada and any games you buy you have to do as a download
##Payment is for the game but you have to pay for bytes as well
##Each game I d/l'ed cost around $5 for the download only (the cost of the game is separate) and they were very standard (not super graphic games)
##Keep that in mind
##I also find the speaker phone helpful in the car altho you still have to flip the phone open to use the speaker which is silly
button[@]##The two things I dislike about the phone is it is hard to keep from hitting the 'web' button and that connects me to the web and i get charged whether it was a mistake or not
##I cant disable that key without disabling text messaging as well
##And I have to say my reception isnt quite as good, but it isnt bad either
##Its a bit of a mix
[t] My Experience
##This is my 3rd Motorola phone ever (previously, T720, V120e)
##I must say when comparing this to the T720, the phone completely destroys the competiton
screen[@]##There are a small percent of users who may experience a white screen bug which is easily fixable by going to a cingular sort to get reflexed
##Pros
[t] Horrible.
##Awful, wretched, miserable P
##O
##S
##Do NOT buy this phone (Motorola V551)
battery[@]##Nothing but trouble with the power supply, battery, battery life, charging time, lack of ability to recieve or make calls while charging, missed calls, etc
battery[@]##Today the battery charger died - now I can't charge this chunk of crap at all and Cingular will not make warranty replacements at ANY of the so-called 'Cingular' stores in my area (Manhattan)
##I either have to wait for those clowns to send me a new charger or go buy a new one at MY expense after owning this hateful object for less than 70 days
##I hate this phone and I hate Cingular
[t] I think im in love.....
##I bought the Motorola V551 about 2 months ago and what can I say other that this phone is awesome! I love everything on this phone
##I especially love the fact that when I take a picture that I can set it as my wallpaper
ringtones[@][u]##I also love the MP3 
##It has rubber around the edges for style and also so it wont drop out of your hands as easily as other phones
##I have had no problems with this phone what-so-ever! All has been just dandy!!!
[t] NOT a BAD Phone
##This is phone has aboslutely crushed all my expectations
##Bad ReceptionLow Battery Life
##If you miss to charge it at night
##you are gone for the next dayBacklight doesn't stay more than 10-15 seconds
ringtones[@]##Need to particularly assign ringtones for all the numbers in the phone book else you won't get the ring
##the default is NONE
button[@]##The side button changes the
##Ringer profiles
##from loud to silent
##and it happens all the times
##Now coming to pros
##Really Good Camera
##Captures good videos too
##Bluetooth
##(never used it though)I'm getting a Nokia 3120
##can't afford to buy another phone
##Finally
##Get this phone
##only
##if you boast of having very good reception
##and you don't miss to charge every night
##Hope this helps
[t] I hate this phone
##I have had many motorola and nokia phones, and this one is BY FAR the worst
##NO reception
##simple as that
##I can not use the phone at my own home ever
##I am changing /upgrading today
##I have had it for 6 months, and kept calling cingular and hoping for the best, for nothing
##They said it's because I have 'trees' by my house
##Ok, so don't buy this is you live near trees (?) !!
[t] BUYER BEWARE
##The phone itself is very nice very very nice but
##IF you are a cingular customer with another motorolla phone don't fool yourself into thinking you can just put in your sim card and be off
##NO NO I tired this and unless there is some secret society that runs around giving out Subsidy codes then you can't use the phone
##Cingular will tell you that they can reasearch the IMEI numbers to try key word try and get you a unlock code for the phone but then the phone is not covered under cingular warrenty and some of cingular features you are use to might not work
##Call AT&T for the code since they are the only next option for this phone made for cingular and them well they too can not give you the code if your not a customer for their company and Motorolla themselves well they will tell you they can't get the number either cause it's done by the company the phone was made for and they don't have access to that kind of code
##SO now again nice phone would be even better if you could use it with your SIM card if you choose
##SO advice don't buy unless you are a AT&T customer or you are getting a SIM card with it
[t] Awful, awful phone
battery[@]##Motorola should have been pulled up on some sort of Trades Description Act because the battery life on this phone is absolutely dreadful
battery[@]##As many have already noted, if you forget to charge this phone each night, the battery is dead the next morning after a couple of hours
##I can't wait for my wireless contract renewal to come up so I can get back to a Nokia
[t] pretty but useless
##This is the third motorola that I've owned and it sucks
##It takes 8 hours to charge and the charge only holds 10-12 hours
battery[@]##I got a new battery but no improvement
##Also it only holds a call for 3-4 minutes then drops it no matter where you are or where you're calling
camera[@]##The camera is nice and it is a pretty phone to look at
##Get a different model
[t] Poor battery life, addressbook . Buy direct.
##Okay, after a couple of months use I can say this phone sucks
battery[@]##The battery life is way shorter than advertised on my phone, my wifes, and a co-workers
battery[@]##It won't even last a week of low use (&lt;25 minutes), and the battery drains to nothing real quick at the end, so you're at 75% for 2 days, 50% for a day and drop to zero before you can get home to recharge it on Thursday
##It left my wife stranded and unable to contact me last week
##Unhappy wife == very unhappy husband
battery[@]##Work upgraded me to a Blackberry and its battery lasts well over 10 days before needing to be recharged, even with all the mail sync and everything else it does
##the address book is worse that the one on the startac this phone replaced, I have 3 entries for everyone at work (home, mobile, office) instead of one entry with three numbers
##(You can change it to display one preferred entry for each name, but this is a pain to find to setup and then use)My original review read
[t] Highly NOT Recommended
##I bought this phone about 3 months ago, and was very happy I purchased it
sound[@],design[@][u],camera[@]##The sound quality way fantastic, camera was great, and the  was awesome
##Just recently the phone was getting a little "iffy
##" The earpiece on the handset was starting to degrade
sound[@]##Overtime, it started to lose it's sound quality, until just a few days ago, I can't hear anything at all! I've been needing to use the handsfree speakerphone in order to hear anyone
camera[@][u]##The  is okay, but this is supposed to be a PHONE, so I can't complain about the image quality
screen[@]##The phone itself has good graphics, but you are unable to view the screen in sunlight
battery[@]##Also, the battery can no longer hold a charge for over 12 hours, without being used
##If it is used, it needs to be plugged in ASAP
##The charger connector (and I've spoken with others who have experienced this with all Motorola phones) no longer connect with the power supply with ease
##In order to connect, you must "play" with the charger and find the right spot for it to charge
##Before I purchased the Motorola v551, I was a devout Nokia user
##After the Motorola, I am still devouted to Nokia
##I purchased a Nokia 3120, and it does not compare to the Motorola quality
##Overall, I DO NOT recommend the Motorola v551
[t] Drops calls
##Facts
[t] have some annoying issues
ringtones[@]##The nice thing about it is that it plays MP3s so you don't have to pay for ringtones
##It has the following issues though
[t] Motorola V551##First of all, I've used Sony Ericsson T610 with both Cingular and T-Mobile service and found them comparable in Los Angeles (Verizon is best here)
##From comparing all three phones (Nokia 6230, Sony Ericsson T610, and Motorola V551) with Cingular service, I've discovered that there is a *BIG* difference in phone reception quality
##Phone reception quality is as follows
[t] Excellent full-featured phone
##I've had it only a couple weeks but so far I am very impressed
##First the downside
battery[@]##I agree with another reviewer that the battery life has been dissapointing-- hoping it will improve over time as the manual claims
##And I've had 3 dropped calls in a week
##On Sprint with my little Sanyo I dropped 3 calls maybe in 2 years! The signal for both companies is pretty good in my house
screen[@]##I went with Cingular cuz of the GSM SIM card to put phone # in cuz I broke the screen on my Sprint phone and couldn't read the #s! But I copied the SIM #s to the Motorola's book and now I see 2 sets of each name
service[@]##help!I'm amazed you can get this level of phone free with service
##Speakerphone, video camera, Bluetooth-- amazing! I'm most excited about the bluetooth to get my pictures out and use as wireless modem
##Haven't done it yet, so anyone please comment on how the wireless modem feature would work with a Cingular plan
##Another reviewer mentioned it takes a lot of menus to get to the Bluetooth function
##You can customize one of the 4 "home keys" (the directional pad) to jump immediately to that function
##I've got mine set for bluetooth, calendar, phonebook, and calculator
##This phone is very customizeable
[t] Good world phone
##I am actually shocked by the reviews I saw saying how horrid this phone was
##I have had mine now for over 6 months and have travelled extensively with it and have had no problems with dropped calls, poor reception (except in certain malls, but I expect that), and poor volume and freezing of the phone
##This phone has been put through its paces and has held up very well (i
##e
##being dropped or being crushed in my overpacked purse), with just some minor scuffing
##The pics I get off the phone are surprisingly good, though the video is not surprisingly poor, but what else would you expect from a phone
##The bluetooth is brilliant and this is a great quadband phone, meaning you can travel around the world and it works great
##In fact, the only reason why I didn't give this phone 5 stars is the placement of the speaker
##It is only located on the back of the phone so if it is buried in a bag, or even in you pocket, you more than likely will never hear it ring even if it is on its loudest setting
camera[@]##However, this is the only drawback, and so if you are looking at getting a decent phone with a great camera and a nice look with a tactile cover, then this is a good choice
[t] Save your self some grief, move along...
##Scenarios that I encountered and why I'm giving this a bad score
[t] Cingular In Hawaii w/ V551
##I was reluctant at first to get this phone for two reasons, (It's clamshell phone and I would have to use Cingular service)When I received it in the mail, I was surprised how small the phone was
##Fits very nicely in my palm and in my pants pocket (Not very big into belt cases)
##It has very stylish looks with the blue and silver
##The blue part of the phone has a rubber/matte feel and the silver looks like brushed aluminum
##The manual was easy to browse through
##It follows very nicely with my "casually play with settings until I have to read manual" attitude with electronics
##The voice recognition calling is a bit of struggle
##I have to repeat the name twice and eventually it takes
##With my limited knowledge I'm guessing it maybe due to ambient noise (traffic, Radio, other people) I've also had issues with assigning pictures to a contact
##Again, I go through the steps (Picture to contact)but somehow I have to do it twice, maybe it's user error
##One feature I do like and use quite often is the speaker phone
##Its great if you need your hands free (ie
service[@]##, Driving, holding baby, typing away on keyboard, etc)As for service with Cingular, I have not been disappointed
service[@]##In the past with another service provider
service[@]##I was not able to get service in my house and only limited service at work if the moons were aligned just right
##However, I now get full bars in my house and every place at work
##You can have the most kickass phone on the market, but if you get crappy reception, the phone is useless
##The V551 w/Cingular in Hawaii seems so far to be the best combination and I couldn't be happier
##Overall, its a great phone with a crisp, bright display with all the bells and whistles you might want in a phone
##Mahalo and good luck with your seach for the perfect combo in your area
[t] cuts out all the time
##My husband and I each bought these phones not to long after they came out
##I had always heard good things about Motorola, but I really don't recommend this phone
##I wish I would have saved the $100 a piece I paid for them
##I like some things about the phone
camera[@]##the camera is alright, it has a lot of features, and it is pretty easy to use
##My major problem is that both phones CONSTANTLY cut out and hang up on people
##Plus, you never know how long you have been talking to yourself
##The phones have speaker phone, which is a really good thing because that is usually what I have to use just to be able to hear the person I'm talking to
##It is the worst when I am talking to my husband on his phone, I guess since they are the same phone
##I really do not recommend this phone
##I really don't think it is worth it, even if you can get it for free now
[t] Motorola V551 = Perfect
##I have had this phone for about a week, and I couldn't be happier
##It has every feature you can think of, and calls are crystal clear even when on speakerphone
##It is the nicest looking phone that I've seen besides the i860 and v3, but those are over $300
##00
##I got my V551 direct from Cingular for $150
##00
camera[@]##The camera takes great pictures and the video feature is pretty cool
##Picture caller id is awesome
ringtones[@][u]##BlueTooth means no more paying for  or wallpapers
##I used to have GSM w/ AT&T and they SUCKED! Cingular has been nothing but a great experience for me so far and I love this phone
[t] broken
##After 8 months of ownership, suddenly the reception went south
##No reception in or near my house, or inside anywhere
##Reception could be good outside (out of town
##) The connection to the charger is finicky, so sometimes it isn't charging when you think it is
##I got the run-a-round from cingular trying to get a replacement
##After two long phone conversations
##I was told to go to the local dealer
##The dealer gave me another phone number to call
##The operator at that number told me that the dealer should have at least swapped out the SIM card to see if it was the problem
##Anyhow, eventually I got a new phone amd so far it works
##I always connect my phone to the charger when driving (9 hrs per week) so my phone is always charged
camera[@]##I won't complain about the need for frequent charging; it's better than my digitial camera battery!
[t] Not bad for a flip
##The phone works good enough
##A lot of the reviews I have read come from typical human error
##Rebooting - I used to have a problem with the phone rebooting when I was using it
battery[@]##All I did was take out the battery and clean the connections with a pencil eraser and the problem was solved
##Charger - I definitely do not like the charger
##The charger ends are fragile and if you step on the end of it on the floor, or near where you plug it in, you will have problems with it
##The charger also has a finite lifespan
##They work good to start with, but after using the charger for a few months, you will need to check and make sure it is charging at intervals while it is plugged in
##If you brush against the cord, or close a door hard, it might stop charging
##Bluetooth - The Bluetooth works excellent
##I see some reviews where it didn't seem to work well and it sounds like people just didn't read the 3-step directions for synchronization
button[@][u]##You should not need to turn it on via the phone, just hit a  on the headset to answer/call after it is set up
##(I use the boom style Bluetooth headset, some others may be different
camera[@]##)Camera - The camera works good in well-lit situations, and very poorly in low light
##The zoom takes a bit to get used to using
design[@][u]##Design - The flip phone  is a little more robust than most other flip phones, but it has the basic flip phone  flaws such as
[t] Lots of features; so-so quality
##I've had this phone since Dec
##2004
##The first one stopped holding a charge after about 6 weeks
##I'd fully charge the phone and a little more than a day later, after no more than 10 minutes of talk time, the thing would be completely dead
##I contacted Cingular and they shipped me a replacement very quickly
##The replacement phone holds a charge much better (6 days), but the battery-life indicator doesn't follow an even path
##It shows a full charge for several days, then goes to 2 bars of charge, and then dead, all but skipping 1 bar
sound[@]##The sound quality is about average
##I like and use the speakerphone
##Turns out I don't use some of the other features (Bluetooth, camera) as much as I expected
##Annoyingly often, the phone doesn't ring when I have an incoming call, even when I'm in an area with a strong signal
##Instead, I get the "missed call" beep about 15-45 after the call occurred
##This is my third cell phone, and overall I like this phone better than my second phone but not as well as the first
[t] A Mediocre Phone, Perfect For People Looking To Frustrate Themselves!!!!!!
##I rate this phone a 1 only because the bar cannot be lowered any more
##This phone is unreliable at best
##Some of the features include
[t] Best Phone out there
##I really dont know what the other people are talking about
##Myself and 10 friends all got this Phone
##Its great
##It works great for all of us
##The hands-free speaker works great and is very loud
##The best part is the Bluetooth
##It is absolutely amazing
##Maybe all these people complaining should try the Bluetooth
##it would make a big difference
[t] Can I give the V551 no stars?
##I don't know if it's Cingular (we call it "Stinkular" as an ongoing joke) or the phone, but we are experiencing all of the same things that are being said here
##-At least 5 dropped calls per day
##I'm tired of saying "Hello? You there?" only to look at the phone and realize I've been talking to myself for the last minute
design[@]##-The charging on this phone is plagued by poor design
##The plug can be easily moved in such a way as to not charge the phone when you think it's being charged
##-Sound is the worst
##You can barely hear anyone with the volume turned all the way up
##-Reception is also the worst
##Don't know if it's cingular or the phone, but from what I hear here, must be both
##-Phone is packed with features, but it is the slowest phone I have ever used
##There is such a delay when dialing, accessing menus, everything
##-Freezes up like it was made to do so
##Have had the phone exchanged and it still doing the same thing
battery[@][u]##-Have had to pull the  to get it to unfreeze
[t] Best Phone Ever
##I was tired of Nextel's i730
##It was getting old after only a year
##I made the jump to Cingular and the Motorola V551 here in the Metro Detroit Area
##All I can say is WOW! Reception with Cingular here outranks Nextel 10 to 1
##The Motorola V551 is an amazing phone in such a nice package
size[@][u]##The phone is just the right 
##Not to big like Nextel i730 and not too small like some Samsungs
##Easy to push buttons
screen[@]##Best screen ever
##Unlike some bigger phones that have a 176X220 2
##2" screen, it has a 1
screen[@]##9" 176X220 screen which makes the resolution really shine
ringtones[@]##MP3 ringtones are much clearer then the WAV ringtones that I had
##Only Complainent is that the speaker is not as loud as Nextels
##But nobody can beat Nextel in speaker loudness
[t] this phone is cool
##I like this phone a lot, the bluetooth connectivity removes the need to pay $2
ringtones[@]##50 for ringtones and transferring pictures between phone and computer is cool
##I dont have problems with dropping calls, and voice dial works fine for me
[t] It is true. My dream phone is good.
##It is true
##I have told these people that this is my dream phone and they say that the phone is a piece of junk
battery[@][u]##They always say that the  looses charge very easy
battery[@]##Dah!!!!!!!!!! if your battery is still full at the end of the day, you don't charge it
##It takes the life away from the object that hold's your batteries charge
##I am getting a new one because I dropped my phone in the ocean and it broke
##2 day's later it came back on
##But it could never stay on
##It was always turning on and off
##Well, great phone
##but as long as it has full charge, don't charge it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[t] except basic phone functions, others are ok
##Pros
[t] One of the worst phones I have ever owned
##Overall the phone is very stylish but lacks in all other areas
##Pros-Stylish great looking phone-Bluetooth capableCons-Build quality feels cheap, most of the ones I have encountered begin making a snapping or cracking noise after a short time when you open or close the phone-Terrible reception-Earpeice volume is nearly impossible to hear even at highest volume-Screen is impossible to see outdoors
[t] The Motorola V551 makes me a happy chatter
##I'm very surprised to see all the horrible reviews
##Maybe it's just a quality control issue and I got lucky
##I got one of the very first of these to roll off the assembly line about a year ago and I did have some problems with that one, but Cingular (quickly and cheerfully) replaced it and I haven't had any problem at all with the replacement
##The volume is decent and I won't claim it drops no calls, but not many
##There are too many dead spots in the Cingular coverage areas but otherwise I don't have much problem
##The speaker phone is outstanding--loud and clear
##I usually use a bluetooth headset and that function is wonderful
##The phone is fairly rugged and although I carry it in my pocket, it's surprisingly free of "wear-and-tear" scratches or scrapes that I've put on other phones
camera[@]##The camera and video functions aren't anything to brag about but Motorola never intended it as a high quality camera and the pictures are more than adequate
##The zoom in/out feature helps improve the quality of the pictures
##The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of a handful of annoyances
ringtones[@]##The phone has a tendency to change ringtones apparently from bumping the buttons on the outside of the phone and finding the menu to change it back isn't as easy or intuitive as it could be
button[@][u]##It also has a quick (and way too easy) record  on the side of the phone
##Although I can see how some people might find the function useful, it's not something I ever use
button[@][u]##Frequently I hit the  and I have to go clear out a bunch of accidental recordings periodically
##I'd much prefer that they put a bluetooth toggle switch in that spot where it would be handy to swap back and forth between the headset and phone
##That can be done but not as easily as I'd like
##I also find the perpetual "no-voice-names" message that I get when the phone makes contact with the bluetooth extremely annoying
##When it pops up it overrides anything I'm doing such as dialing
##It seems to think I'm unaware that I didn't have any voice names and it has to keep reminding me over and over again
##Yeah, I still know! Still don't need them! That message along with one that tells me that the bluetooth is connected has to be cleared before the phone can be dialed or answered or anything else
screen[@]##If it pops up while I'm attempting to answer a call, it will frequently disconnect the call when I exit out of the message screen
screen[@]##There is a symbol at the top of the screen that shows when the bluetooth is connected so the message is redundant anyway
##One other thing I don't care for much is the charger Motorola uses on most (maybe all) of their phones
##The cable doesn't merely slip into the phone like the Nokia and Samsung models I've used in the past, but these have a hook-like connector and I've broken a few trying to get them to connect
##Why make that so difficult? Luckily chargers--along with other accessories like batteries or phone covers--are cheap and readily available on ebay
##Those little irritations are pretty minor compared to the overall usefulness of the phone
##Maybe it's because this is my first bluetooth phone, but I've really enjoyed it
size[@][u]##It's a nice  and the surface is easy to grip and hold
##I've been very satisfied with this phone
##Let me just add that my brother uses this same phone and although we share some of the same complaints, he doesn't have problems with his and he's happy too
[t] There are better phones out there
##Phone worked pretty well at first, but I noticed that my wife always had a better signal than me, dropped less calls, and her phone doesn't mess up nearly as much
##It is not very user friendly
##The menus can be confusing
##The reception is not very good, and now I can barely even hear people sometimes
##So I'm getting a replacement
##cheap phone
[t] I wish I'd have gone T-Mobile this time.
##I can't believe I'm having this problem
##The phone has a horrible time staying on
##My old Nokia 3360 had a 7 day standby!IF I get a full charge, the most it will do standby is almost 2 days
##If I use it for more than an hour total, or about 4-5 text messages, I have to fully recharge it
battery[@][u]##Certain days I will get up, and see a full 3 bars of  meter
##I think Motorola made that as a joke
battery[@][u]##By lunch, it goes from 3 bars to 0, without progressing through the 2nd bar, and without giving me any failing  tones, like it is supposed to
##From full to ZERO in Zero seconds flat
##Impressive
##I think Motorola spent 6 months developing a practical joke machine
##The local Cingular office has given me replacement batteries, I am on my 3rd in 10 months
##Even new batteries don't fix it, but Cingular is telling me it should
##Now, lets get to another feature someone else has already spoken of
##GETTING the thing to charge is a chore
##I plug it in, and, NOTHING! My old Nokia would charge right up
##I have to unplug and replug and poke around the recharge cord
##I seem to have better luck plugging the phone in, then plugging it into the wall, but that only takes 3 times
battery[@]##And a great feature of my old Nokia 3360, if the battery is dead, you can use it by plugging it into the wall!Can my v551 do that? NO! It needs to charge for at least 2 hours before it will even turn on
##Please consider another phone
[t] This phone is cool, but it really does suck...
##Pros
[t] Yep. Some models do eat batteries.
internet[@][u]##I purchased a brand new V551, wishing to take advantage of its EDGE  capabilities
battery[@]##However, right out of the box it sucked the life right out of both the included battery and the one that I used on my V400
##In fact, it looks as if both batteries are now unusable
##There is no doubt that some of these units are defective
[t] 4th Try is not the charm
##This is the 4th phone from Cingular
##The first 3 V600's were dropping calls every 18-21 minutes
##Defect in the phones
##They were nice to replace it with a V551
##It too is dropping calls
##The non-ability to use voice dial is a crime
##The videos aren't worth anything
##just a novelty
##When the phone hangs on to calls, the voice quality is good, the features are fine, and the bluetooth is priceless
##While the dropped calls may be a motorola thing, I've never experienced so many dropped calls (in a major metro area) on the other carriers I've had
service[@]##They have good customer service
##My suggestion is to get a Sony-Ericsson or to use another carrier altogether
[t] Great Phone, features, and Price!
##This phone is a great phone especially for the price! I got it through Cingular with a two year contract extension
##It cost $150 - $50 MIR for a total of $100
##This phone has all the features you could want in a high tech phone
[t] Pain in the A**
##We've been with Cingular for over 10 years now and owned many different phones but I have to say that this is the worst one we've ever owned!! Just like the majority of reviewers we have experienced
[t] The most aggravating phone ever
service[@]##I usually don't review items, but this phone / service is so poor that I wanted to be sure that I added my comments
##DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!I am on my !Third! replacement under warrantee
##They will replace your handset if you keep complaining
##Still does not work correctly
##Get used to "call failed", voicemail notifications that don't go away and dropped calls
##Is it Cingular Service in general?The problems
[t] search for v551 and battery life on google.
battery[@][u]##a fully charge  does not even last for 2 day with minimal talk (30min or less)
ringtones[@]##I even turned off all features (bluetooth, MP3 ringtones

battery[@]##Motorola support adknowledged that lots of ppl complain about the battery life
software[@][u]##You will need to purchase  and cable if you want to sync contacts and calander with outlook or manage photos
software[@]##i've used similar software from siemens and Nokia, both vendors provide the software for free on their website and they work 1000 times better than Motorola's
##i usually change my phone every year, but i did not keep this moto v551 for a month
[t] Demonstrates a LACK of Quality from Motorolla.
##By the spec
##sheet and features set this phone looks great on paper
##But in reality, like other moto products it doesn't funtion properly
software[@]##In my opinion the bigest problem is due to the poor embeeded software on the phone
##My V
button[@]##551 does not repond very prompty to button presses
##The biggest thing that disapoints me is a problem that shouldn't occur
##When the phone is placed on the charger it often doesn't reconize it
battery[@]##For example if the phone's battery is dead, and one puts it on the charger it will just sit there with out starting charging
##I have to open the flip display to tickle it into starting the charging process, now that's POOR DESIGN
battery[@]##A follow up on the same issue is that once chargeing has started, and if the battery is dead, the user can not turn on this phone
screen[@]##If he/she does the phone will turn on come to the home screen and imediatly shutdown
battery[@]##This can be very frustrating when you need to use your phone on the charger when the battery is dead
software[@][u]##As well as those  issues, my phone generates large ammounts of electromagnatic noise
##When my phone's on and I'm near anything with a speaker, that speaker makes quiet beeping noises
##The amplitude and frequecy of speaker noises is higher if i'm on a phone call, or if the phone recieves signals from the tower
##I am very concerned that this phone my be cooking me or what it could be doing to the next generation when its in my pocket
##Don't try telling motorolla about your problems if you get this phone
service[@]##They will just deny that there are problems and service you like you are a fool, not a customer with valid concers
##I would recomend purchasing a phone form another manufacture
[t] World Phone
design[@]##V551 is a great phone to have with its bright color screen, easy navigation, speakerphone, and sleek design
##The phone is a Quad band GSM phone which means you can use it on any GSM network in the world, pretty useful if you are a globe trotter
camera[@]##It has an integrated camera with zoom and exposure control
##You can send pictures you took and music in your messages with its MMS capabilities
##With 5 MB memory, there is a lot of stuff you can store on this cellphone
##Navigation is easy and additional options are available in most screens with the 'menu button' which has a context-sensitive menu
##The phone has bluetooth, so when you are driving, you can take calls with a bluetooth handsfree, even if you cannot reach the phone within the car! Speakerphone is very clear!
[t] Excellent Phone
##The best phone I've owned by far
##I've owned many of the recent top of the line stuff from Panasonic, NEC, Nokia and Motorola
##I'm a phone nut and this phone is the best of them all
##I'm not into the cameras, etc
##What I like is the extremely solid feel, outstanding reception and clarity of my calls, especially when compared to other high priced phones that Cingular offers
##Also, the speakerphone is surprisingly clear and useable and the display is beautiful, with easy to navigate menus
##An excellent phone all around
##My only negative? No USB port
##The phone has bluetooth, but how many of us have bluetooth on our pcs?
[t] Tons of problems
##This phone came highly recommended by tons of people
##So I bought it this past summer in June
##Well, a couple months after having it, I have noticed a bunch of problems
[t] so-so
##I got this phone on recommendation from the Cingular salesman who also sold the same phone to both of my parents
##We all loved the phones when we first got them
##However, as the months pass, I've had several minor but irritating problems that surfaced over the summer
service[@]##My parents have had fairly good luck with their phones (it's mainly problems with Cingular service rather than mechanics of the phone for them) but mine have been with the phone itself
##And apparently, the things have gone wrong for me have also been happening to others as well --I've seen similar topics on several forums at Motorola and Cingular about this phone that I have also experienced
[t] good phone
##I've had this phone for months now
##It seems to work good for me
##I sometimes get dropped calls, I don't know if its cingular or the phone
##It takes excellent pictures
##All the features it describes works perfectly
##I like it better than most other phones I've seen ppl using
##You can't beat the deal on amazon anywhere
[t] Don't get this phone!
##I was with T-Mobile for about 6 years, had an ancient Nokia 5100, and figured it was time to upgrade my phone, so both my boyfriend and I switched to Cingular and got Motorola V551's
service[@]##We both are signed up for two years with this crappy phone and service
##Our phones drop calls all the time, we have to stand by a window in our home to get service, sometimes the phone just freezes up so I have to turn it off and wait two minutes while it "loads" back up
##What if I needed to make an emergency call??? I've complained to Cingular many times already, and nothing
##I long for my ancient Nokia 5100
[t] Best phone yet!
##This is the best phone I've had yet
##I haven't had any problems with it and have had it almost two months
##I've only had one phone called that dropped and I can get reception in every building I've been in with it
##In the back of Super Target I had to move 2 feet b-4 I could get reception, that was the only incident
##I've used it in Sam's Club, Super Wal-mart etc
##and it's clear as a bell
##Can't say that for other cells I've owned in the past
##I love the camera, it's not extravagant, but it's good for what I wanted
##Easy to use, cute, bright colors, blue tooth is awesome! I wish I could get better access to the web, but it's not a PC after all! I get asked about this phone a lot to people who are thinking of purchasing a new cell, I always tell them they will be happy with it
[t] Mechanically, it's a good phone -- but poor user interface.
##My only gripe with this phone is that Motorola's user-interface just doesn't have an apparent logic to it, and as a result you have to dig out the user manual time and again
##Also, if you use reading glasses, you will probably need them with this phone b/c there is no option to make the tiny letters in the display any larger, as is the option with some other phone brands
[t] Hot and Cold
##This phone replaced my nokia 6340i
##(I'm debating returning it)Major Gripe
[t] Good phone!
##I love this phone
##It takes good pictures and video
##I'm still trying to figure out if it takes more then 10 seconds of video though
##When you are typing a text message or names in your phone book this phone will auto suggest what it thinks you are trying to say which I like, its less typing for me
service[@]##Dropped calls and service all depends what area you are in
service[@]##I'm in a populated area so I don't have to worry about that but when I'm in an area where all the houses are 2 miles a part I have no service
##It is not the phone, it's the provider
[t] Amazing phone overall-Long,detailed review
##I rarely post reviews,though I scour them before purchasing anything!I did extreme research before purchasing this phone,and before deciding on Cingular as my provider
##Cingular,hands down,has the BEST coverage area,period!NO DROPPED CALLS,Kansas City
service[@]##Customer service is not as bad as many reviews state
##They have always answered EVERY question I have had,and dont hesitate to call them for anything
service[@]##*I have learned,to go right to the ZERO option for direct customer service to get the most knowledgeable people
##Ok,the phone
##I went from a digital Nokia,to this,my first flip phone
battery[@]##I wasnt sure if I would like the flip phone,but I LOVE it!I bought my daughter the Samsung x427m at the same time,and it too,is a great little phone,as far as battery life and signal strength(much better than mine!),but fewer features,no camera,not as customizable
##Ordered the Motorola V180 for another line,also,great little phone with minimal features, though, more customizable than the Samsung
##Again,did extensive research,even for the freebie phones
##Will list cons of this v551 first
[t] I've had a good experience with this phone
##I've had this phone for about four months now, and I haven't had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces
battery[@]##I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one)
##It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections
##My charge lasts for several days if I do this
##I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though
screen[@][u],sound[@],camera[@]##In general, the phone has great  quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera
##I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders
##I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage
##Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc
##) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc
##) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services
##I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection)
##I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me
##I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one
##Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone
[t] Rebate caution porting numbers
##If you're with Cingular or AT&T; your phone comes activated which means that when you have your number ported your original activated number gets canceled which voids your warranty
##The website only says that they haven't worked out a procedure with Cingular and to contact Cingular
##No mention of their dealer code cancellation if number ported
##Some people are going to be in for a very big surprise when they don't get the rebate
##Because I had my number ported which I needed I am stuck and Amazon will not work with me on this
##It's a shame because up until now I have been very satisfied using Amazon
##Now I feel like I've been taken for a lousy $100
##As far as the V551 phone
##it's great and I'm really happy using the bluetooth Motorola HS 820 headset while driving
##Voice dialing, clarity and everything else is fine so I don't understand some of the negative reviews below
##It's an earpiece not a telephone and everyone hears me fine
##Mobile PhoneTools also works fine with desktop using Linksys adapter and the V551
##It does everything it's supposed to do so again I don't understand negative reviews
##I'm using XP and a 1
##8 processor with 512 MB memory
[t] Great!
##Wonderful phone!Pros
[t] Good Features, Good Looks, But could be more
##I recently changed from simple Sony Ericsson T310 to Motorola V551, so my feedback is based on comparision of two
##While V551, is extremly sleek and good looking with additional advanced features like crisp resolution, bluetooth, GPRS/EDGE, Camera, Speaker and Video, it lacks the user friendly interface of Sony Ericsson
##It is not possible to search a name in your address book, except for jumping to particular alphabet
##Also the address book displays each number seprately, so you wud have XYZ (Home) and XYZ (Mobile)
##One drawback (and major for me) is that this phone does not have a mute option
##This might be important for people who travel and attend lot of conference calls
##Having a mute lets you attend as a silent listener from a noisey airport!!Overall the phone is great!
[t] not bad at all
##first, in response to j
##doe's comment
[t] Motorola V551
##If it were not for the poorly written, nearly useless manual, and a few issues, I'd give this phone 5 stars
##That being said, so far it's a very good phone, packed with many features! Prior to purchasing the V551, I'd owned a sturdy Kyocera (2135) and wanted something similairily solid, and not "disposable" as many new wireless phones are
sound[@],camera[@]##Upon searching for a new phone, I was dismayed at the tiny, delicate, hard-to-dial/use phones on the market!!!! I own a real digital camera and was not interested in one on a phone, but the durability, easy-to-dial layout and sound qaulity of the V551 sold me!Unlike some of the "obviously" fragile, ultra small, light wieght phones now so popular, the V551 is well made, with a durability factor standard for Motorola
##The user interface is NOT very "user" friendly compared to a Nokia or Kyocera
##But for the core phone/voice mail features I'm finding my way
sound[@]##No thanks to the poorly writen, incomplete manual!The sound quality is superb over other "tinny" sounding minature phones I tested
##The ring tones that come with the phone are good, though more business sounding rings are preferred for the adult business crowd
[t] Awesome!!!!
##I just bought this phone today, and i just wanna tell you somethings that may help you make a decision
##I upgraded from the Motorola t720, and I am amazed that my chargers for that phone work in this one
##Also, i just saved all my phone book entries to my SIM card in my old phone, and the card is now in this phone, as with all my phone entries
##This phone lets you take pics of your contacts, and will display the pics next to the entry! As with the T720, this phoen lets you assign different ring tones to the entries
ringtones[@]##The ringtones are awesome, the best i have heard on any cell phone
camera[@]##The camera has a zoom, and it takes awesome pics, it even adjusts to dark and extreme light
screen[@]##The screen is awesome, very bright and has awesome detail
##If you are used to a flip phone, especially a motorola, then this will be easy to navigate
##The outside trim has a rubbery feel to it, like it might actually be able to take a pretty good bump
##It is a very solid phone, the hinge is strong feeling
##Of course, i have had this phone one day, so i may have complaints later, but i hope i can help someone out with a decision
##The one thing i dont' like about this phone, is that it is kinda thick
##Not nearly as light as my old T720
[t] Perfectmoto
##This is my first Motorola phone
##I have previously had a Panasonic DuraMAX prepaid phone with AT&T;, then a Sony Ericsson T226 with Cingular on a one year contract
##I am happy to say that I am completely blown out of the water with this phone! The design, silver with a blue rubber surrounding it, gives the phone a beautiful and striking appearence
battery[@]##The blue rubber can also be foudn covering the battery cover on the back
##Next thing I'm impressed with, the feautre set
##One word
[t] V551 - impressions six months on
##I've been using the V551 now for about six months and while I like alot of the things about it, I really dislike how god awful slow the phone book is to scroll, and how annoying it is to find names in there
##So here's my list of bad things on the phone
[t] MoTo V551
##This phone is pretty neat
screen[@]##Keep in mind that the chrome outer layer DOES BREAK EASILY! and the blue outside screen is worthless bc u cant see self-portrait photos on it
##it does NOT have a flash which plays a BIG part in what i buy
##the good side is that it DOES capture video and it does look nice
ringtones[@][u]##better  wouldve been nice though
##its okay if ur not too picky about features
[t] Good...but some flaws
##The phone is a real cool phone but there is somethings that are wrong, or could be made better
screen[@]##For one the buttons aren't down far enough, so after a while of opening and closing the phone, you start to get marks on the side of the screen
##It has a voice recorder, but it only records for like up to two minutes
##The other thing I don't like is when you put a number in the address book, and then add a home phone number and e-mail to the name, it shows up each seperatly, instead of all being grouped together under one name
##Also, Unless I just can't figure it out, I don't think you can play voice records on speaker phone
##But other than that its a pretty good phone
[t] motorola
service[@]##I am so irritated at the poor reception and dropped calls that I'm now taking steps to change phones, service carrier or both and I've made my peace with the notion I may end up losing money on the phone and early cancellation penalty
##I was forced to upgrade both phone and carrier (ATT to Cing)when my old moto met with an untimely death
##I needed a phone asap and did not research the 551 b4 purchase, a decision I deeply regret
##I must clarify that I live in central florida near the I-4 corridor and this is NOT a low population density area
##Many of my dropped calls have occurred on major arteries in this area, which are not rural
service[@][u]##I am not a new user of cells and don't believe I have unrealistic expectations of 
##I've consulted others for their opinion in an effort to "triangulate" feedback and reduce the possibility of my own subjective bias
##Bottom line
[t] BUYER BEWARE DO NOT BUY
service[@]##My husband and I recently signed up for Cingular service and purchased these phones for $150 each
##We have already been through 4 of these phones and they are how do I put this nicely
##a piece of junk
##As soon as I walked into my office the next day people came out of the wood works and hoped I had better luck than they did with this phone
##We'll I didn't
##I am a real estate agent and have lost at least $5,000 due to unreceived business phone calls
##The phone will just shut off for no reason right in the middle of a conversation
##It will lock up not allowing you to turn it off or anything
##For several days at a time I was getting no calls at all
sound[@]##I was told by some of the callers that they were hearing an ear piercing sound and then it would just go dead
##That REALLY helps my business
##NOT
##Then sometimes my voicemail doesn't even work
##Upon the 4th phone we called Cingular to change to a comparable phone
##Well Cingular could care less if your phone works or not
##It is sad when a company doesn't stand behind their products
##DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE AND GET A REPUTABLE CELLULAR COMPANY THAT STANDS BEHIND THEIR NAME AND PRODUCTS
##IF YOU DONT YOU'LL PAY IN THE END
[t] Goodbye, Moto
##My wife and I each purchased V551s with our migration to Cingular 6 months ago
##In that time (during which the phone was never dropped, bumped, etc), I've replaced my phone twice, and hers once
##The problems we've had include
[t] Great phone!!!
##i bought this phone about two weeks ago
##I recently owned the V220 which was the worse
camera[@]##I wanted a flip camera phone and decided to get the v220 because it was free
##YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
##I went on and bought the V551 after some research
##I asked a few cingular representative and read reviews on amazon
##The phones picture quality is much better than the v220
##I'l admit that i've had a few more droppped calls with the v551 than the nokia 3560
##The v551 has great wallpapers and skins
##I bought a brand new hs820( which is the bluetooth headset)and it really is handy
##it works with the phones built in voice dial
##go to the address book record a name
button[@]##press the button on the headset and say the name works great
##Ive alway had trouble with those headsets with wires
##I've used al of its features except for the cable for tranferring ringstones etc
internet[@][u],button[@][u]##The   doesnt give me an problems because my fingers are tiny
##this phone is very sleek and replaces the need to buy a faceplate
##This phone is one of the best phones that cingular has to offer
##HAS ANYONE USED THE FASTFORWARD FEATURE!!1
[t] Mediocre
##The Motorola V551, in my opinion wasnt designed to be a telephone, but a toy
camera[@]##I am 16 years old and people consider the components like the video camera and what not to be 'teenager', but i still havent found use for all of them! And i have owned the phone for 6 months now
camera[@],size[@]##My favorite things on the phone are the less-smooth feel for better grasp, the speakerphone option because people i talk to cant tell the difference and i can be across the room from the phone and be heard, the camera because its handier than carrying around a digital one everywhere, the bulky size which i think helps me to locate it in my purse, the ability to jpeg pictures as wallpaper, and the calendar is very useful
button[@],battery[@][u]##The less than favorable things are the side button that changes the ring mode, (What genious thought of that?) the weak and ironically lifeless  life, the fact that when i try to use a button to take me to oh say, MEdia Mall, it takes way more time than it should
internet[@]##You can compare the connection speed of the V551 to another phone as dial-up to broadband internet
##When it gets a signal for data it causes audio equipment to make obnoxiously loud beeps and buzzes
##I can actually tell ahead of time when i am getting a call or a text message just by being near a sterio, and am able to answer the phone by the first ring (but i guess thats not such a bad thing
##)In the address book you cant narrow your search you just have to go by the first letter and additional numbers for the same person get saved as a whole other contact
##Oddly my signal is so weak in my house i get more dropped calls there than anywhere else, in the country
##Also, some features like AOL Instant Messanger, and bluetooth dont work at all for me
##I will be getting a replacement soon because i can say first hand water damage is a terrible thing to experience, and hopefully i just had a dud of a phone, so i am keeping my hopes high for Motorola's sake
##So if you are someone who travels alot, has patience and gets lucky and gets a fully functioning phone, this is for you
##IF NOT, SPRING FOR THE MOTOROLA RAZR V3!!!
[t] Moto v551, an excellent purchase
##I got the phone 2 weeks ago, and it makes me happy
ringtones[@]##The bluetooth transfer works great with my Mac and transfering my custom iTunes ringtones to the phone is just too cool!Just go a wireless headset today, Scala500, and it sounds fantastic
##The e-mail set up works flawlessly, can check my Earthlink account when away from home
##I haven't set up the v551 as a wireless modem to connect to the internet, yet, but that is something to look forward to
##Cheers
[t] Beware of Cingular Pricing and Sales
##If I had not been careful, I could have paid Cingular anywhere from $25-100 for this phone within a two day period
##Cingular has a serious lack of conformity between it's business units
price[@][u]##The online  for this phone was different than the  offered by the business sales group, and different from the one offered at an official Cingular store
##and I would have never known about the $50 rebate that was posted two days after I had purchased a qualifying phone if I had not happened to peruse the Cingular website
##The transaction to convert 5 individual lines into a single family plan took about 4 hours to complete over the phone after being bounced from department to department
camera[@]##The phone itself is fine and the camera is more usable than I had expected it to me
[t] Worst Phone I Have Ever Had
##This is by far the worst phone that I have ever had
##I have had three different copies of this phone (Not by my choice
##Under Cingular's Warranty program, you can't even discuss getting a different model untill your third replacement)
##For my first verision, the phone stopped holding a charge
##For my second copy, the only way I could hear people on the other end was through speakerphone
##For my most recent version (which I had for only FIVE DAYS), the microphone did not work, so people on the other line could only hear static
##Luckily, I am finally going to get a different model
##Do not buy this phone under any circumstances
##You will be aggrevated and dissapointed
[t] Good and bad
##If I could charge the phone, it would be fine
##My biggest frustration, as with many other reviews that I've seen, is that the charger doesn't connect and so you have to wriggle it to make it recognize the connection
##I drop this phone all the time and it's held up nicely
##It's a bit bulky and I'm ready to get into a smaller phone, but voice quality is fine, and I don't have as many dropped calls as I've had with other Motorola and Nokia phones
##A tip
[t] Motorola V551
##The Motorola V551 is a prety dependable phone
##It has really withstood a lot of damage
##I have dropped it on numerous occasions on many different surfaces
##I have even dropped it in the toilet and it still works
battery[@]##Overall, the only problem I really have with it is the battery life
##It's probably about standard, but I was hoping for a little bit more when I purchased the phone
design[@]##The features and design are great
##The call quality is pretty good especially for the Northwest Arkansas landscape
[t] What to expect
battery[@][u]##I am going to discuss the design, features,  life, call quality, and give my overall opinion on the Motorola 551
design[@][u]##The  is a bit heavier than what I expect from the average flip phone, but I may be biased because my previous flip phones included the dainty Audiovox 8600 and a Motorola Star Tac back from the analog days
##It fits comfortably in the hand, and is comfortable to talk on
##It does not fit nicely in one's pocket, but I can easily tuck it into my smallest purses
##However, since I do not often carry a purse, a phone clip or cover with a clip is a necessity in order to not misplace the phone
##Also, the phone tends to get scratched up easily
##Finally, I have a friend who has this same phone and the hinge broke
##The features are numerous
internet[@][u]##They include text messaging,  browsing, ringtones, and games
##My experiences with this phone are on the Cingular network
##Sending text message is about as time consuming as one would expect, even if he or she is experienced with the typing method of the standard cell phone
internet[@][u]##I have never used the  browsing and have no opinion of it
##As for games, I have only tried the Bejeweled that came with my phone
##It loaded quickly and played smoothly
##As for ringtones, Cingular's ringtone website has loads to choose from
ringtones[@]##You can set different ringtones for different callers
##As a joke, I have the Star Wars "Imperial Death March" set to play when one of my friend's calls
camera[@]##The videos turn out decent, and the camera function is fun because you can set background wallpaper and assign people's pictures to their entries
battery[@]##The battery life is not very good - I do not consider myself an excessive cellphone user, but I need to recharge the battery every night no matter what
##On unusually busy and long days, my phone dies before my day is over
##Call quality is decent, but I have low standards due to years of disappointment with the quality of cellular networks and cellphones
##It does sometimes drop calls, and sometimes the other person can hear me but I can't hear them or vice versa
##However, I do not know whether or not this is the phone or the network
##The area I live in has very few cellular towers
##So, my overall opinion - it's a decent phone
battery[@][u]##The only truly irksome thing is the short  life, especially considering the bulk of the phone
[t] dropped calls and bad connections are a way of life for phone
service[@]##I am so irritated at the poor reception and dropped calls that I'm now taking steps to change phones, service carrier or both and I've made my peace with the notion I may end up losing money on the phone and early cancellation penalty
##I was forced to upgrade both phone and carrier (ATT to Cing)when my old moto met with an untimely death
##I needed a phone asap and did not research the 551 b4 purchase, a decision I deeply regret
##I must clarify that I live in central florida near the I-4 corridor and this is NOT a low population density area
##Many of my dropped calls have occurred on major arteries in this area, which are not rural
service[@]##I am not a new user of cells and don't believe I have unrealistic expectations of service
##I've consulted others for their opinion in an effort to "triangulate" feedback and reduce the possibility of my own subjective bias
##Bottom line
[t] Speaker Goes Bad
##This is the second phone I have had and the speaker in the ear goes bad
##Volume will cut out in the middle of the conversation and I have to tap it on something to bring it back
[t] This thing is a DISASTER !!
software[@]##Ok I never, ever write reviews but this time I need to act for the common good! How can you sell a product with a software so full of bugs and a hardware as awful ?I've seen lots of people complaining about white screens, phone stopping, impossible to place a call
[t] Enjoy this phone, it's a good one!
##I have owned this phone for 3 months and it has performed superbly
##The ring-tones are wonderful
##The reception is superior to all phones I have owned since 93' combined
##The talk quality both in listening and transmitting is amazing
##I have no idea why some have rated this phone subpar because it really has worked incredibly well for me
##Get this phone, it will make you happy!
[t] Just hope your phone never quits working
battery[@]##I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off
##The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem
service[@]##After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable "due to customer abuse
##" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as "customer abuse"), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation
##It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty
##You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works
##After that, you're on your own
[t] Not that good
##I thought this phone would be better then my LG, I had
camera[@]##I love that it has a camera and video, but that is really the only good things about it
battery[@][u]##My phones freezes, drops calls, changes the audio on it's own, and now, it won't hang up when it's closed so my  dies if I don't turn it off, so I have to turn it off when I am not using it, which means I miss calls
##I am definitely looking into another phone right now
[t] Good phone overall
##I've had this phone for over a month, and have not noticed any of the bad characteristics this phone seems to be notorious for
##It has never frozen, dropped a call, or done anything else that a quality phone wouldn't do
##However, the placement of the ring change buttons on the side isn't exactly smart, and the speakers could be louder
camera[@]##The camera is exceptional considering its in a phone, but the video is suprisingly bad
camera[@]##However, this is to be expected, and if you were planning on using the phone as a video recorder, just buy a digital camera
##Overall, the phone feels solid and well-built, and is probably capable of withstanding a few good falls
##I have read alot of bad reviews on this phone, and I have read excellnt ones
##I can only conclude that buying this phone is a "crap shoot", in that you have a chance of getting a good quality phone or a bad one
##I personally think this is a superb phone for the price, so I must agree with the other good reviews
[t] Moto V551 review
##This phone is a really good deal
##especially since its free after the rebate
sound[@]##The sound quality is great and I always have a good signal (from Cingular)
service[@]##It is much much better than my old Nextel service
##The phone looks good and is much amaller than my old Nextel phone
##I am definatly happy I purchased this phone
##I gave the phone a 5 star because it is overall a very good phone with cool features, including bluetooth
##There are two things that I didnt like though
##First, the instructions for the phone are amongst the skimpiest (by skimpy i mean worst) I've ever seen
##I had to play around a lot
##my menus from the Nextel phone are VERY different from this
battery[@]##Second is, the battery life indicator isnt too accurate
##It told me my phone had a full charge for 3 days
##then on the 3rd day it went from a full charge to two-thirds to dead withing 8 hours
[t] Phone decent - one disappointment
##So I chose this over the Razr because of all the rotten reviews and complaints I've heard from people who own it
##I almost wish I had gone with the Razr (just for the looks)
##This phone is great and sounds clear - I have great reception and get better reception than my boyfriend who has the same carrier
sound[@]##The sound is clear and the menu options are waaaay better than I remember
screen[@]##(I was against Motorola because I liked the Nokia menus) The only problem I see is that on the pictures I saw through Amazon the picture caller ID fills up the entire screen - NOT TRUE - I got this phone excited to try out the picture caller ID and once I assigned a pic and got my first call on it I opened it to see a dinky little picture within a small menu pop up
##Worthless! I don't even use it now
##I have looked up online and checked the manual to fix this problem with NO luck
##It is slightly irritating and now that I have been looking longer the ericsson s710a looks to be awesome and as soon as I can upgrade I am getting that phone! Which brings me to another gripe - I love Amazon BUT Amazon does not allow exchanges! Come on - I got this phone for the great deals BUT my mom got the same phone for free at the Cingular store and has the option to exchange it
##I thought Amazon was great with their cell phone deals but I would never do it again - just go to the carrier themselves - believe it or not they have just as good deals with exchange options and their rebates don't take 8 months to redeem (slight exageration but still
##) Read closely to note that rebates from Amazon require a paid cingular bill so it will be quite a while before you see a rebate check
service[@]##Otherwise great phone and so far great service carrier (I was at t-mobile previously - glad I switched)
service[@]##And not to go on forever - but those switching to cingular will be pleased with the service and network calling but will be disappointed with their media plans
##text messaging and browsing are charged at ridiculous prices
ringtones[@]##Also their ringtones and graphics charge not just for the ringtone but also for the download of it
##HORRIBLE compared to tmobile
[t] Fundamental quality leaves something to be desired.
##The engineers of this phone definitely thought of everything as far as added features are concerned
##This phone has magnificent features
screen[@]##The screen color is brilliant and very bright except in the sun
##It has bluetooth
##It has AIM
##It takes the best pictures I've seen from any phone
##It records videos
##It's so easy to use
##I'm going to cry the whole way to the store to return it
##If you can't make calls on it then it defeats the whole entire purpose of having the phone
##This phone definitely has some fundamental issues
##I have been using this phone for 30 days
##It continuously drops calls on me
##In a call (from my land line) to the Cingular agent, I was told that it was dropping calls yesterday because they were working on the sytem
##What about the four days before that when it had the same issues? My sister, who is on Cingular network, doesn't have any of these issues that Cingular is claiming to be network wide
##I haven't been able to make a call longer than 10 minutes that didn't get dropped
screen[@],battery[@]##The battery life on this phone is absolutely the worst of any I've ever seen! If you make more than two calls per day on it or if the inside screen gets activated more than four times then it has to be charged daily! I'll miss the features but it will be nice to have a solid 10 minute conversation again
[t] Nice phone but some issues
##I just purchased the V551 through Cingular to replace my Samsung A620 that I had with Sprint
##Over all the phone is nice but there are a few things that are of issue
##1
battery[@]##) The standard battery needs to be recharged often
##If you have the bluetooth feature turned on it drains even quicker
battery[@]##The first time I used the phone the battery drained in 2 days and that is with very low talk time
battery[@]##The manual states that battery time will increase after the first few charges so we will see if that is true
battery[@]##I would like to get an extended battery but haven't seen one for sale yet
##2
##) Dropped calls
service[@]##Not sure if it is the Cingular service but I have had more dropped calls in the first few days then I ever had with Sprint and my Samsung A620
##On the plus side my signal strength is better with this phone and Cingular but that hasn't paid off in better phone calls
##3
##) Bluetooth- there needs to be an easier way to turn the bluetooth feature on and off
battery[@]##I only use it while in my bluetooth enabled Acura TL so I would like to turn it off easily when not in the car to save battery time
##With this phone you have to go through several menus to get the the bluetooth off feature
##On the plus side there are some things I like about the phone
##1
##) Quality seems very good so far
##2
##) Screen resolution is good and bright
##3
##) Bluetooth works great in my Acura TL
##The signal strength and incoming caller id shows up on my car display, pretty cool
##I can talk hands free via the bluetooth setup and the cars built in voice system, pretty cool as well
[t] Worst Ever phone I owned
##I have owned this phone for one year
##After six months calls started droping, bad signal catching and it goes on
##I would never suggest this phone to any one
[t] Frustrating flaws make for painful ownership
##My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket
software[@][u]##There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola  and menu structure
##This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before
software[@][u]##I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The  is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel
screen[@],battery[@][u]##Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much  power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen
##The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling
service[@]##I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i don't know whether its the service or phone
##Overall i want to like the phone but i'm searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it
[t] I really like this phone.....
design[@]##I really like the clamshell design with the rubberized portions on the front and back
##The phone doesn't slide off of tables and car seats like my old phones
battery[@]##I have not had any problems at all with the battery life, I have actually found it to be superior to my Nokia and Sony phones
##I use it every day and usually only charge it once a week
##Luck of the draw on the batteries I guess
screen[@],camera[@][u]##The screen quality is gorgeous and sharp, but the  gets drowned out by any nearby artificial light source - works fine in sunshine though
##The only real problem I seem to have is that the volume on the earpiece just will not turn up past a whisper
##I've never had a phone where I have to say, "Excuse me?" so many times when I'm already at top volume
##No games, but for me that is not a problem
##Good reception and once you figure out the keypad it's very easy to use
##Don't depend on the manual to teach you anything though
##It is just useless- don't even bother trying
##Just use good old trial and error and common sense and you'll be enjoying this phone in no time
price[@]##I would buy this one again even at full price - which I may have done already if Cingular stiffs me on this rebate like they did on the last one
##Time will tell
##Very good phone for the money
[t] Motorola v551
##I liked the v220 until I saw this
##The speakerphone is very clear
##Also, if you need a headset get a bluetooth $29
##99 (after MIR) from cingular online
camera[@]##Also, camera is great
screen[@]##Lager screen than the v220
##But, Motorola needs to improve the video feature
##But phones werent made to take video with
ringtones[@]##Also, still Moto's don't come with any good ringtones
##So more money for Cingular for a real music ringtone
##All in all it is a great phone for $100
price[@]##00 (after MIR) I like it better then the Moto Razr v3 at a fifth of the price
[t] Great phone if you don't mind dropped calls
##This phone is great
##The speakerphone, camera, video recorder, etc
##The big problem is the fact that it drops calls every 7 minutes or so
##Sometimes more or less frequently
service[@]##I just spoke to a customer service representative, and they said that it is a defect in the phone, and it needs to reconnect to the network every three days or so
##This means I must turn my phone off for 10 minutes or so every 3 days
##This is just a big pain and unless you want to deal with this problem, please do not buy this phone!
[t] Kept me with Cingular when I was ready to leave
##I had a Samsung X427 before this and it was awful
##Dropped calls, poor reception, wouldn't hold a charge
##This phone changed my opinion completely
##It does everything I need and then some, and the camera/video is a bonus
button[@][u]##The only downside and the difference between 4 & 5 stars was that it did not behave well with my Jabra EarWrap-the remote  did not work-and the speakerphone is a joke
##But speakerphone is not really what I needed, it was reliability and function
##Really a far step forward-I recommend it for anyone needing a reliable phone
[t] BEST phone I've ever owned!!
##I just got my new v551 last week, and I must say it's the best I've ever owned
##I love the blue rubbery exterior and the brushed silver
##It's an attractive phone
##I've read several reviews that said negative things about the manual, but honestly, I don't have that problem
##I didn't even really need the manual because after playing around with the phone for about 15 minutes, I had all the menus figured out
##I really like that it rings LOUD if need be, and I love the sturdy overall feel of the phone
##The speakerphone is the best I've had
##The reception is phenomenal
##I've had really bad phones/reception and now people are suprised that I'm on my cell phone and not on my land line
##It sounds that good
##The pictures are MUCH BETTER than I had with my LG 1200
##The screen/display is large and crisp
##I just can't say enough good things about this phone!!I am very pleased! =)
[t] Product Recall Anyone??
##I want to know if there was a recall on this phone, if not there should have been!! I have had TWO in the past and both times I have had such a hard time hearing people! It's the same story as the other reviews I read, I have to cram the stupid thing against my ear so hard it hurts, or use the speaker phone (which is still hard to hear at times) for the longest time I thought I was the only one
##The first phone I had the speaker went out, I squeezed the ear part really hard and it worked!, but only to have the backlight to go out on me
##I had to get a new phone, I did, and 2-3 months later the SAME THING HAPPENED with the ear part
##I recently dissasembled the old phone and I cannot figure out how to get the speaker to work! (I fixed the backlight though)
##Over all If your interested in this phone, its actually a very good phone but only when it works
##I really like the features, the polyphonic stuff and the video cam, but now there are better phones, this one is starting to show age and I CANNOT recommend this phone with the poor performance I have experienced
##Its a dissapointment, and a pain in the ear
[t] Great phone.
##John Doe needs to read the manual and learn how to use his phone! My husband and I have had these phones for almost nine months and they are excellent
##We have had cell phones for seven years and have four kids with phones, so we've had lots of experience with different phones, and these are good, solid phones, among the best
[t] So far, so good
##Update to my Jul 25 Review, July 31, 2005Reviewer
[t] Good phone with good features
##I've had this phone for a little over 3 months now
##First of all, don't buy this phone if you can't figure out how to navigate through menus on your own
##The instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) doesn't explain a whole lot and the menu is counterintuitive sometimes
##So for a first time cell phone user, it might be better to have a Nokia (my first phone) since they're easier to use
price[@]##On the plus side, it has lots of features for the price
##if you use them
camera[@]##I use the camera a lot when I'm comparison shopping for things so I can remember what they look like or the prices of items
camera[@]##The camera is your average cell phone camera
##It's cool that it has a zoom feature
##The video capture is a cool feature to impress your friends, but don't count on catching any action sequences
##It makes one big blurred mess if you try
##I personally use the speakerphone a lot and people have said they can't tell I'm on it
##The Bluetooth I use sometimes
battery[@]##I'd use it more if it didn't drain the battery so fast
battery[@]##Speaking of battery life, it's pretty bad
##I have to recharge the phone every night if I talk for more than two hours on it during the day
screen[@]##As other reviewers have mentioned, the screen is hard to see in daylight
screen[@]##Turning down the brightness on the screen seems to help it a little bit
##One more thing
##I'm the biggest klutz in the world
##I'm the Urkel of Texas
[t] I love it
battery[@]##I have had it just a week now and I have yet recharged the battery
##Maybe they fixed it? Yes I do talk on the phone
##I was also able to use it to check my gmail, hotmail and my works email
##Could get on AIM and ICQ with no problem
##Camera takes ok pictures for a cell phone
##Best I have seen so far
sound[@]##The mp3s sound great over the speaker and the speaker phone is pretty clear
##Clarity is hardly an issue
##Voice recording is easy
##good for those sudden thoughts
screen[@]##The screen is very clean IMO
##Play poker on it with no problems
##I really like the phone
##Cons - none?
[t] What more would you want?
##I have had the Moto V551 for nearly a week now
##I cannot describe the relief I have now that I've actually got a phone that doesn't dissapoint me
##I am a tech junkie
##I own a recording studio and have a degree in electrical engineering
##After doing a collaborative 4 hours of "homework" on phones I decided to go with the V551
##My expectations were VERY high! Even higher was my expectations to be disappointed
##However, I was not disappointed at all
ringtones[@][u]##First off, you can actually transfer pictures,  (which I've made a few of my own sampling DVDs, music, and even my 2 year old saying "pick up the phone Dad!") using the bluetooth enabling and bluetooth dongle for PC
##So right off the top I was already pleased
##I don't care what anybody says, you DO NOT need the Mobile Phone tools to transfer ringtones, pics, or video
##You may need Phone tools if you want to sync your phone with Outlook or other data transfers
##The only thing needed is the V551 and a bluetooth dongle
##Ok, so we got what I hoped and expected out of the way
##Now for the pleasant surprises I got in addition
##Voice dial - VERY NICE! Especially when using a blue tooth headset, you can have your phone in the stinkin' trunk and still answer the phone and make calls using the blue tooth!Display - is by far the best I've seen to date
##I've got a digital picture (taken with a REAL digital camera, not the phone) and it is spectacular
camera[@]##Colors and resolution are AWESOME!The camera part of the phone is exactly that, a phone with a camera in it
##Don't expect to use this for anything except maybe snapping a shot of someone your are putting in your phone's address book or if you get in a fender bender to document damage
##The speakerphone is awesome, you can clearly hear the person and they can clearly hear you
##Easily the best speakerphone I've had
##The handset is also clear
##No more saying, "wait a sec
button[@],size[@][u]##what'd you say???"Some reviews here get all bent out of shape over button  and location
##That is some of the lamest information I've seen
size[@][u]##All phones have buttons, and depending on the phone  dictates the  of the buttons
##I am a 6' tall male with hands roughly 8"-10" in diameter
##I have NO PROBLEM with the buttons
size[@]##The V551 isn't the lightest or smallest phone on the market, but for someone my size it is great
##It actually has a little weight to make it feel like a phone (not an empty plastic shell of a phone) and the hinging on the flip is strong, I can actually put it to my face without feeling it want to bend backwards
##The outside display is good too, very cool blue color scheme, true, no outside photo caller ID, but you can pay a little more and get that in a different phone
##If you want a reliable, well built, and "as advertised" phone this is the phone to get
##Not to mention the fact that Amazon will pay you $25 (after rebate) to take it is nice too
##This is easily the best phone I have had to date and I've been wireless for almost 8 years now getting a new phone every year
service[@]##This phone is exactly as it is described, and that alone makes it worth 5 stars, I've had too many phones promise me features only to find the features weren't described acturately or were dependent on other parts of your wireless service (meaning I have to PAY to use them) This is not the case
##Enjoy it if you get it!!!!!
[t] Good looking, sturdy, reliable
##My wife owns this phone
##I made the mistake of getting a Treo 650 (see review there), but I wouldn't mind having this phone instead
##Sharp looking
##Reliable
##Very sturdy, much more so than some other Moto phones I've seen (read
[t] Everything is clear now
##I only got this phone two days ago, but I have to tell you it's already proven to meet all my expectations and more
##The most significant thing about this phone is the great voice quality
sound[@][u]##I still have my old cellphone working (Samsung x426 from AT&T), and for the last two days whenever I get a call on it, I tell people that I'll call them back with my new Motorola cellphone, so I can immediately hear the difference, and everyone have been telling me how clear I  on the new phone
##Gone are the days of saying "what? what?" all the time and asking people to repeat what they said
##I can hear everyone loud and clear, even in the middle of a party
camera[@]##The camera is also nice and easy to use
##The interface may have few quirks, but it's reasonably easy to use
##This phone at over 4 ounce is larger and heavier than the Samsung, but definitely manageable
##The number of rings and games it comes with is disappointing, although there is a way to download mp3 as ring tones
##Overall, a very good phone with superb voice quality and clarity
[t] Sleek little phone!
##After years of having a non-flip phone, I still wasn't sold on the idea of having to open the phone every time I needed to answer or place a call
##This phone comes Blue-Tooth enabled, so I also purchased the Blue-Tooth headset and when that feature is in use, you don't have to flip the phone open to place/answer calls
##The clarity is excellent, although I'm still not answering the phone quite correctly with the headset
##A detail I'll get worked out
##Didn't want a camera, but the phone came with it
##The menus are easy to use and fairly intuitive and it's easy to personalize and program
##I think I'm going to be very happy with this purchase
[t] Very Nice!
##I can't give this phone 5 stars yet because I have yet to use it, but 1st impressions are great
##I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision
##Visually this phone is sooo much better lookin
design[@]##The electro blue lighting in the front is way cool and the design is super sleek
##Contruction is definitely quality with a solid feel and rubber-like grips
design[@][u]##The keypad is alright, i find the number keys are a little strange becuase they're not aligned i guess to fit the  shape but that's ok
##Also I'm a little confused as to why they switched the red and green buttons around, and my 7,9 buttons are dimmer than the others, dunno if thats just the phone
design[@]##I upgraded from the motorola t720 which I think has a way cleaner design and layout but this will do
screen[@]##The screen is very bright and sharp, way sharper than the Sony
##The menus looks plain but with the added skins it looks sweet! I dont really care for the bluetooth since its pointless being less than a feet away from me, unless using to transfer to pcs or somethin
software[@]##Overall i think the v551 is a great phone for now, I really liked my old t720 except for its slow software but i think they fixed that problem on this phone so I expect this one to perfomr even better
[t] It's pretty good phone but not without it's flaws.
##People have pretty much commented on the pros and cons and I won't repeat
design[@]##But just to give you an idea of the sloppiness of the design team
##The phone has a nice speaker phone on th eback of the phone
##That's ok but it also means that you want to use it with the phone folded
button[@][u]##You would think that a standard feature of the phone would be to answer calls on speaker when the phone is folded by hitting the smart  and then disconnecting by hitting it again
##Nope and it's not programable
button[@]##Smart button is a dumb button
##Another annoyance
##Let's say you want ot adjust the volume of the ringer while the phone is folded
button[@]##Easy huh? Nope, you have to switch through some preset modes by clicking on the smart button
##Too bad if none of the modes have the right volume for the situation
screen[@]##Other annoyances are reflecting facets which blind you with sunlight just when you're trying to read the screen
##No games and if you want some you have to pay for them and the download so you're double charged
##Come on
##Talk about extortionate practices
service[@]##Just charge once please and don't force us to sign up for more service packages
##I made the mistake of getting my phone through sbc and paid for it
##Given that you get paid if buy it here it's not so bad for what you pay
[t] Disappointed in Bluetooth capability
##I purchased this phone specifically for the bluetooth technology
##I also purchased a Motorola HS810 bluetooth headset to go with it
##My prior experience with bluetooth is that it is always ON
##NOT SO with this phone! Every time I turn on my phone or open the boom for the HS810, I have to go through the menu to reconnect to my bluetooth HS810! For me, this defeats the purpose
battery[@]##Of course I can always leave the phone and HS810 on and never turn them off, but that's a waste of battery for me
##Very Disappointing in this age of technology
[t] This phone is tha bomb
##The Motorola v551 phone is built for those individuals who enjoy not only taking pictures but for those who like shooting videos, and it offers bluetooth
##The bluetooth capability on this phone is awesome, you can take the phone to somewhere like CVS and develop pictures for cheap prices
##You can also use this phone in areas where you have bad reception on most other phones because this is a quad-mode phone
##You can use this phone with wireless technology
##if you purchase the bluetooth enabled headset, you can use this phone wirelessly
screen[@]##The screen on this phone has great colors
camera[@],battery[@]##It has a good battery life for a camera phone
##I think this phone rates as a 10 stars out of 5
[t] This phone was a waste of money
battery[@]##Besides the complete inaccuracy of the battery life meter, the tendency for the antenna to unscrew itself, and fall off and the horribly unintuitive UI for this phone, I have to say that the ring tone and volume contrils on the outside of the phone have to be one of the most poorly planned cell phone features ever
##I can't tell you how many calls I have missed or how many times my cell phone has rung at inopportune times when I thought it was on vibrate mode - and how truly frustrating this is
##If I could return his phone I would - and the next phone I buy will not be Motorola
[t] Great phone, worthless battery life
##I've had this phone for about a month
battery[@]##I get about 36 hours of battery charge with maybe 20 minutes of talking before the battery goes dead
##That is without using the other features of the phone
##(Bluetooth, games, speakerphone, etc)
battery[@]##The battery life makes this phone useless as a wireless phone, because it's always connected to the charger
##Otherwise the phone is great and full of features
[t] STAY AWAY!!!
##This phone is no good
##Ear volume is WAY too quiet
##Signal jumps up and down and all around
##Calls hang and do not complete connection
[t] Disapointed in Chicago
##I was am very disapointed with this phone
##I am in in the process of sending it back in exchange of the Nokia 6230
##I knew that I should of stayed with Nokia but I wanted to try something different
##The reception is terrible and week
##I can only use this phone when I'm inside my house by the windows
##When I'm in certain areas in my state there is a lot of static
##I didn't have all of those problems with my Nokia 3560
##I just can't deal with it anymore
##I've had the phone for 2 weeks and I'm ready to send it back
##If you want a phone with good reception don't buy Motorola
##A lot of my friends had bad experiences with Motorola as well
service[@]##The Cingular customer service is just as bad
##They keep transferring me around
##Nobody seems to know where to send me
##Since I ordered online they say that I need to exchange it online
##Well I can't find the option anywhere
##So now I'm back on the phone
[t] Cingular's 30 Trial is not NO RISK
service[@]##I've just finished dealing with Cingular Wireless almost 2 months after trying their service
##One reason I tried it out (switching from Sprint) was because they offered me a "Risk Free 30 Day Trial
##" I took this Motorola phone home with me that night and it wouldn't work in my apartment
##I tried to return it the next day and switch my number to Verizon (which does work beautifully!)
##It takes a day or two to "port" the numbers so I missed Cingular's 3-day window to return
##They couldn't transfer the number quickly enough so I was charged the activation fee
##A couple days later, after talking several times with Cingular and Verizon reps, I got my Verizon phone sending and receiving calls and returned the Cingular phone
##I received my second bill last week because Cingular didn't think I returned my phone
##30 minutes at the store I got the phone today cleared up that problem (good thing my work is flexible) and I was told I still owe $61
##It appears I am paying prorated charges for the calls I made for those 6 days of service, plus all applicable taxes to every municipality in the area, and for the activation, which enabled my phone to work practically nowhere
##Cingular's "Risk Free 30-day Trial" is costing me $61
service[@]##That's not risk free to me - if you have a 30 day trial, and you say I can return and get a refund, REFUND ALL THE STINKIN MONEY - NOT JUST PART OF IT!Worst service ever - go to Verizon, where the phones work and the business isn't garbage
[t] Camera is great, but everything else sucks. Go with NOKIA.
camera[@]##If you're buying this for the camera features, great
##But why not just get a real camera??If you're a current Nokia user, you will most likely be disappointed with this phone
##Motorola does things differently(unintelligently)
##This phone has too many things about it that takes control away from the user
##For example, you can't delete any of the default pictures from the memory, you're forced to look through Motorola's stupid pictures for as long as you own the phone (same goes for the sample video clip)
button[@]##When you dial a number and it fails to connect, you can hit the "retry" button
##But when you do this, if it succeeds in connecting, the phone will set off a long, loud beeping tone to announce the success of connection
##Very annoying because when you dial a number, you don't sit there and stare at the phone to see if it's connecting, you put it directly to your ear
##So when you hit the "retry" button, instinct tells you to put the phone to your ear, so when the success tone goes off, it's like holding a ringing phone up to your head
##Good job, Motorola
##Also, it's annoying that the whole bus has to know that you're making a phone call
##And of course, there's no option to turn off the alert during a successful redial
ringtones[@]##Next, changing ringtones
##With Nokia, you can pretty much have ANY ringtone you want
##I had a ringtone that just gave off one single beep and that's it
##With this phone, there's no such option
##The "single beep" ringtone will beep continuously, which really doesn't make it as discreet as I would like
##And of course, there's no option to change it
##With Nokia, if you want voicemail, you just dial #1
##With this one, you have to click once for the menu (1), twice to get to voicemail (2), then once more to call (1), which adds up to 4 clicks just to dial vm
##With nokia, you can press and hold #1
##One click with Nokia, four clicks for Motorola
##Next is text messaging, which is its worst feature, in my opinion
##To get to a blank page for text messaging, you need 3 clicks
##With Nokia, 1 click
##Once you're on the blank page, if you want predictive text (which most of us do), you need to click 3 times
##Total of 6 buttons to press just to start writing your text
##Predictive text on this phone is such a joke that I don't even want to get into it
##Just take this advice
[t] Not a bad world phone!
service[@]##I've had this phone for just over a year and use it with my Cingular service
##This isn't a bad phone
##It's a world phone, has the normal phone book (with fax, email, multiple phone numbers), calendar, internet, calculator, voice recorder, downloadable games and ringtones, external caller ID/VM notification/text message, and signal strength, etc
battery[@]##What I don't like is short battery life and having the ringer set up on the side of the phone
##Whenever I bump the side of the phone I change my ringers from what I have it set to, to something else
##Annoying
##Call quality is
##eh, okay
##Motorola didn't hit their mark with this phone, but it's been reliable
##I guess that's all I can ask for
[t] Worst Cell Phone I Ever Owned
##Plain and simple, don't buy this phone
##It has plenty of bells and whistles to attempt to compensate for the fact that it has terrible reception and frequently drops calls
##Granted some of this is a result of the Cingular network, but I have been very dissatisfied with the phone
battery[@][u]##When I called to complain I wasn't getting my voice mail in some cases until two days after a message was sent, Cingular told me I need to take the  and card out of the phone every once in a while
##There is a problem when you have to do that
[t] Frustrated and disappointed
##I up grading my contract with Cingular and part of that deal was to buy an up graded phone
##I was told over and over that the Motorola V551 was the best on the market
battery[@]##I had the phone for less then 30 days and noticed that the battery would not charge properly
battery[@]##Cingular replaced the battery and still the same problem
##I reported it to Cingular and they replaced the phone with a refurbished phone
##It seemed to work fine and 30 days later, I noticed that I could NOT hear people on the phone
##Their voices were distorted
##It gradually got worse till I couldn't hear them at all
##Called Cingluar again and they replaced it with another refurbished phone
##It had the same problem
##I called and complained and told them I didn't want a refurbished phone, since I bought a new one, which never worked properly when I got it
##They replaced it with a brand new Motorola V3 razor phone
##They finally admitted that there were problems with the V551
service[@]##I have to give Cingluar 5 stars for their service and response in trying to deal with a manufacture defect that is not of their own doing
##But be warned, the V3 razor phone seems to have similar issues
[t] What a piece of junk ...
##This is by far the worst cell phone I have ever owned
##Stand-by time is less then 24 hours
##Talk time is less then 1-hr
##The claims Motorola makes in regards to this phones performance, are simply a flat out lie
##Once the charge bar starts to fall, you better get to a charger
##You will need a charger in your car, home and office
##The performance is awful
##I know of 3 other people that fell for the trap
##We all HATE THIS PHONE
##The reception sucks
##Too many useless features
service[@]##Granted, my Cingular wireless service is possibly the biggest piece of crap wireless service out there
##Combined with this phone, I am ready to jump off a bridge
##Calls are constantly dumped
screen[@][u]##The LCD  cracked after 2 weeks
##Stay away from this phone at all costs
##Stick with a Nokia
##I would love to have my old Nokia
[t] disappointed, was it carrier or phone?
##I thought the V551 was a pretty good phone, then had problems with reception that I was unable to resolve
##I am not sure if it was Cingular or the phone, as they told me that I had burned out a SIM card (phone?) and that all the subsequent problems were due to the phone
##I will give Motorola the benefit of the doubt, although I admit I exchanged it for a treo 650
[t] i liked it
##I got this little phone as a replacement for my old old old Nokia that I used to death
##The phone itself works well, but does have a few pros and cons
[t] Warning, Not a good buy!
##I've had wireless devices for 20 years
##This is the worst one
battery[@]##I have had to return my Moto V551 phone 2 times and replace the battery once
##The first time was within the 30 day Cingular warranty for volume problems
##The second was for volume and bluetooth not working
##After 30 days you can only get a refurbished phone up to 1 year via the provided Cingular warranty
##- Battery Time is awful
##I get about a day out of a charge
##- The volume level is too low
##You can't hear callers
##- The camera/video quality is very low
##- Bluetooth to PC usage is cumbersome
##- When you open the shell beyond what is I find to be an uncomfortable angle to use, it feels as if it will break off
##- Your stuck with the case it comes with
##No color options I am aware of
##- Official Motorola Accessories, cases, headset, etc
##can be found at WalMart and at cheaper proces than the Cingular store
##In addition
##Since migrating from ATT, I have found Cingular to rate at an unacceptable level for Customer Service, repair, dropped calls, return merchandise, hold time, customer side web site not functioning, etc
##It has been my experience that the "Sony T637" and just about any Nokia device are a better choice
##Cingular is the best deal pricewise in my neighborhood but you get what you pay for
[t] Liked my Samsung X426 better
ringtones[@]##I just bought this phone about 3 weeks ago, b/c i wanted to be cool and have mp3 ringtones
price[@]##I found the price to be reasonable
##One good thing, is that I don't have any dropped calls, which I did with my Samsung X426
##Other than that, the menus are bulky and not user friendly
##The manual does not tell you how to do anything
battery[@]##The battery on this phone is absolutely scandelous
battery[@]##I constantly have to have the thing connected to the charger, at home and work, b/c I am afraid that I will actually need the phone in an emergency and the battery will be drained
battery[@]##The battery will drain the same day after it is charged
##My Samsung could go on standby for over a week
battery[@]##The battery is NOT ACCEPTABLE
##Also, I still cannot figure out how to get the phone to alert me when I have a text message or voice mail
##My Samsung would constantly beep or make noises to notify me that I had a message
##I have lost several messages and spontaneous appointments b/c I am not around my phone when I receive the message, and the phone is not around me
##I would sure hope that this can be changed
##One simple, one time beep is NOT ACCEPTABLE
##The volume control sucks also, the loudest volume level is still too soft, you may need a hearing aid to hear the phone ring
##I would go with nokia and stay away from motorola, motorola seems to be a company that does not get it
[t] How to turn off Cingular web button
##Simple
##Go to Menu > Settings > Security > Lock Application
##It will ask for your unlock code
##Default is probably 1234 (if not, check your manual)
##Once you're in, lock all the web-related stuff
##This way, if you hit the cingular key by accident, you'll be prompted to put in your unlock code
[t] GSM improved
##When verizon was charging me too much for simple features, i wanted to switch
##I came upon the cingular 250 plan with the v551
##The v551 has quad band for international roaming and the sim card is 64k for now because cingular and at&t are intergrating there networks
##I used to be a huge CDMA fan and leieve that the IS2000 connection was fast
##Cingulars GSM has improved its signal, claritiy
##The phones feel is nice with the rubberized covering
##The speakerphone is amazing!
service[@]##The service is amazing clear and perfect
##The phone has themes and everything
##The video is a bit blurry, but its VGA what can you expect
camera[@]##The camera is nice and the contrast and zoom are awesome
##You can assign peoples names to pictures and picture id's
##The phones bluetooth i have not tried out yet but i will be buying a handset soon
##Amazon is amazing because if you buy this phone you will get 150
##00 back!!
##This phone is a must buy
[t] THE BEST PHONE EVER
##Hey all you buyers
##This phone is the best phone i have had and I have only had it for like 2 days
##The pictures are so much better and clearer and the video is AWESOME!!If you like to take pictures and everything youll love this phone so buy it
##The best phone i have had and ever will have!!
[t] On the telephone
##Hello I would like to know if the telephone motorola V551 this unblocked, I live in venezuela and I want to buy this telephone but I need it unblocked
[t] Read before buying a cell phone.
##First, let me tell you about these cell phone plans from Amazon
##Unless you have a great credit score a deposit may be required
##Chances are that if you are rejected, Amazon may not tell you
##Knowing this, it is in your best interests to be very proactive
##Always be certain to read the contract, or you may be sorry
##Many contracts have huge penalties, which may not be aware of
##Also many companies do not have coverage where they claim to
##Zane, a town in Utah has more coverage than my office building
##Once you are certain of a carrier and a plan, then pick a phone
##Nobody wants to end up like me with cell phone trouble
[t] Broken Phone
##I received my phone on or about Jan
##25
##It was set up properly but from the first day did not hold a charge
##The manual said to charge it 4 or 5 times and the charge will get better
##This was done and now the phone is DEAD
##What do I do?
[t] Not a Sony Ericsson
##I tried it
##After one hour of fidgeting with it's childish userun-friendly interface, the darn delayed number buttons, no games, dreadful ring options, I want my T637 back
##I'll do with less resolution in pics, no video to have a more grown-up phone
##This V551 is going back
[t] Beware of LOUSY Cingular system
##I got this phone from Cingular one week ago, and it NEVER worked
##I had to call them and waitting for more than 30 mins to talk to the representative AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN during mt thanksgiving holiday
##They still CAN NOT fix the problem so far
##Their excuse is the merge of Cingular and AT&T
##I guess they already have enough customers now and do not need any more
##I am going to return my phone and swith back to T-mobile
##At least I can see the logo on my phone
##KEEP AWAY from this LOUSY company!!!!!
[t] bad
##wen i got dis fone i wuz impressed i tought i wusnt gonna like it but its very stylish no dought about dat overall the fone does have good reception n it has wonderful the bestes speaker
##but den the fone iz xtremely fat its very heavey n wen it vibrates its very annoyin u hear the vibration more den the ring video records r like 10 seconds the keppads r 2 wide so i returned it for the samsung p207 which iz an awsome fone
